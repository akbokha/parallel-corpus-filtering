<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would live there for the first time now.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and ran his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a deep impact on me that I became a journalist because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, covered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate who wanted to occupy the highest federal court with judges who were interested in his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free to Method Man," "" "It was as if this is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona had only reinforced my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said, "America is the only country I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very blackish love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how to deal with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain with his opinion, as you say so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague puts it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and voted in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican primaries was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever achieved.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and its voters with the people I had met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism programme, which receives people from all over the world, a deeply believer person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "also, Trumps Weltanschauung complained not with that of Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the" "" "Cincinnati Inquirer." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the Phoenix Suns in the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intolerance also stands in contrast to the generosity I experienced with Sandy Bahr, who fought for the environment for a long time, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still adapts herself to the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Richey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump reproved its way to the nominative Republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">It turned out, however, that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The discussion with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they either shared their racism and fanaticism or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify the people, one of my friends said, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and implies an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, voted for Trump, because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might want to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who comments on the cruel decision to lift a man looking down on those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (Ed.): as much as the whites revolt against all the other ethnicities, white and whiplash word play in allusion, as the great Van Jones described, has just killed what America has made so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever belief or background you may have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyanor, whose story, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the choice of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the White America's promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">All this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of word with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump," said Mr. Khan, my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America? "Mr. Khan said.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd answered with a loud" "" "No!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "" "" "would Muslims have a place in your Americas?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "the crowd roared." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your Americas?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your Americas? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried, and their voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "would anyone not be like you, a place in your Americas?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country for whom his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">That's Trumps Land now, the message said.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could find no place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And it breaks my heart to me.</seg>

<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca together with the children of the Paraguayan city of Caterura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music played in both places has changed not only the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the trash</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town that is very popular with tourists -but worlds apart from nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years now, La banda de Música (music band) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest in the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and the gangs fire.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and gave the youth such a rare ray of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI comments:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and playing with glittering eyes and playing in the bustle you learn to play trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero are the children of Cateura - a village that is located practically at the top of the largest landfill of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with remanufactured instruments consisting of local solid waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura where the recyclers under the direction of Favio Chávez have begun to turn parts of waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums, all of which were made of trash.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music, as well as music from the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and musician of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage. children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something he had never seen before: a violin made from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments made of reprocessed material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic Waste ponie) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">Every year, the world produces about one billion tons of rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and live with him are the poorest - as the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they transform him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played its music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and team work can fight illegal fishing successfully</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that tackles wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that reports on international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-publication takes place as part of an agreement with Global Voices for the sharing of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia waters before it opened the coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly upset and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comes, Mozambique and the Seychelles were rapidly mobilized against the ship. they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything," "" "Benedict Kiilu, a senior clerk of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered and followed the ship at its time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia due to the plundering of the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal fishing (illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">Alongside Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that the prime minister had sold out of their waters back then.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and working together. they exchange information and are mutually exclusive where illegal fishing is concerned," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable trusts project Ending Illegal fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to detect. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">The deliberate disregard of existing laws through which certain habitats and species are to be protected can harm the illegal fishing ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail pace with information between individual countries, the actions today are happening in real time, traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also draws attention to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This makes it possible for authorities to designate ships fishing in prohibited areas. also, such suspicious itineraries can be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship loads his caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence, where they were on the go and possibly whether they have a criminal enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports on the basis of this information, which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay punishments, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "there is considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that's what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm engaged in the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to return estimated 20 million USD to lost revenue, which the eight members of the HISH-i network lost every year due to illegal fishermen who enter into East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include, among other things, actions such as sailing under false flag, forged royalties, indication of fantasy names, fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non-completely organized control system," "" "says Long." "" "in the past, a ship could fish illegally and a country could say" "" "You cannot run my harbor" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me" "". "and this legal loophole is trying to close FISH-i now." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">The closed front has so far been working.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 investigations of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It revealed criminal networks that had distributed fake licences in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has tracked and found fleeting ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international agency for combating crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that aims to help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps to track down the illegal ships that would like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position. and that's what we try to cross," "" "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fishery data and provides FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is therefore helping build a system that connects different levels of information. FISH-i shall help to find criminal vessels with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations can actually influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the marine conservation organisation Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide using the position of each trackable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "meeting with neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and bundle their resources for the investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this at a global level." "" "Mr. Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that previously fished without license and hardly had any consequences, now know that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i have meanwhile recorded a 33% increase in fisheries turnover since fishing boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i had helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors found on board towing nets that were forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that other countries are now also copying us," "" "says Kiilu." "" "we are a study object." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="148">In 2015, six countries joined together to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they too are fighting against illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i. "With security, the aim is to allow even more such initiatives and structures to emerge in other regions," Copeland says.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member country Somalia was able to sign its first big triumph: in October, it presented Greko 1, a ship sailing under false flag. and not only was the ship on the road without a license and used towing nets that are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also penetrated into forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "with the taking of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong signal that they are going against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time proof that such a special, collaborative approach to protecting the oceans is actually working throughout the world. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London.</seg>

<seg id="153">Road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are considered to be a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on President Nicolás Maduro's removal.</seg>
<seg id="155">This picture of María Alejandra Mora shows a close-up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela rejected the motion of the opposition to a referendum on impeachment, Venezuelans, in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into emptiness, assembled on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (e.g.: the refunds of Venezuela) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also conducted in other parts of the country, including the Barinas area, in the Andes region Mérida and Táchira, in the central North of Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country continues to deteriorate, which is reflected in the daily life of Venezuelans due to an acute lack of food and medication.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw in the inauguration of the current President Nicolás Maduro the chance for a fundamental change; ultimately, however, the holding up of a re-election was blocked by official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, Contributors at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">In the context of the social, political and economic crisis in which the rate of inflation and violence is among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% for the annual financial statements) and in which there is a serious and far-reaching lack of food and medicine, the referendum applied to many as the only way to return the country to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance of Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or short MUD (about: round table of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups joined forces, called on the demonstrators to take a mass rally to support the National Assembly. in addition, a twelve-hour strike on the following day, as well as a march to the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan government headquarters, was planned to continue on 3 November.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter, among other things, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is so far Venezuela: morning National Assembly, Friday nationwide civil strike and on November 3 all to Caracas to the Miraflores palace.</seg>

<seg id="176">On Twitter, pictures that talk about confrontations as well as reports of oppression and mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="177">Especially large waves beat the news about police repression in the centrally located town of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">There the demonstrators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed advocates of the government.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they could safely leave the cathedral, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop the police forces, including this woman in the Andean state of Táchira:</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in Táchira do not wear skirts because otherwise you could see something that many National Guards did not have!</seg>
<seg id="182">In the meantime, an infographic already makes the round, which covers the scale of oppression every day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship suppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a legislative procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets.</seg>

<seg id="189">Others are evaluating these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government that, from their point of view, has taken little action against the devastating economic crisis and has rather occupied critical voices:</seg>
<seg id="190">They took us so much - but also the fear!</seg>
<seg id="191">Marches are increasing frequency and intensity.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 at Día a Día, an Argentinean news site.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to take a look at the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine city of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano now said in the context of the great La Perla Ribera trial in the province of Córdoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial which ended on 24 August 2016 was investigating crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father, up to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept family secrets for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time I thought it was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years, one does not realise that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not see that my father was a thief, a torturer and a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis Alberto Quijano had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was a police officer. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was deputy Commander of the intelligence department 141 at La Perla prison.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Archive recording.</seg>
<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor who is accused of abduction in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quianos son, a man who, over the years, recognized the extent of atrocities he had experienced as a boy and who testified before a Federal Constitutional Court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a path of redemption for himself.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For translating, you need two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the belief that translators in the target language should not be in the source language - native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native language, which could produce translations into English. this may be due to a lack of understanding of translating, cost reasons or the relatively small number of native speakers that learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who do not have foreign employees, can still produce translations internally. then the Japanese staff, whose English language skills are rated as the best, are made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confused and enigmatic phrases that arise through machine translation show that this technique can't replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English phrases in Japan, including the mysterious prints that often decorate T-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable as jewellery or at least harmless. but by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards, we can expect more thorough translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more reliable source for their translations.</seg>

<seg id="391">"" "main page of the portal" "" "Navegar con Libertad" "" "(Free Surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society)." ""</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday, 7 April, Venezuelan Internet users announced that they had no access to the online channel Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the websites of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online broadcasters also carried out photographs of the protests in Caracas, organized by oppositional groups, resisting the government of Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">Protests began in early April after the Supreme Court disbanded the Parliament and the Parliament's tasks were transferred to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was capped and recommended users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to access the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># censorship: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet pages of Venezuelan operators are again blocked.</seg>

<seg id="400">Offers like Vivoplay are popular among Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been hesitant in reporting on protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission for Telecommunications threatened them with fines and closures, if they continue to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as a "call to violence."</seg>

<seg id="403">It's amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two liters of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfilata later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible by blocking the domain name system (DNS), but also two other online channels. this also affects the website where the National Assembly transmits its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Earlier research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had revealed that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond to requests concerning certain domains correctly.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by DNS, the server responds wrongly or denies the request when calling such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third locked channel, the transmission was set on Thursday, 6 April, when the VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, who transferred the protests into Caracas live, was taken into custody.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in custody in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went back on show.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, the government has also reported that the government regulates Internet connections: this makes the Venezuelans access to multi-media coverage of the current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="525">High up in the Kurdistan mountains in the north-east of Iraq, animal rights activists Hana Ahmed Raza and their team of scientists from the non-governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working on protecting the ghostly Persian leopards.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subspecies of the larger family of leopards, who wander through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxopolor). in total, it is between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered because of poaching, the loss and fragmentation of their habitat.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"" "as Raza points out in the video," "" "the Persian Leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" "" "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem depends on the fact that there is a big predator." ""</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard indeed in the wild is low and goes against zero. when the team in the video therefore determines that they have a picture of a big cat in the camera-all, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a trained biologist, Raza happily portrays a different side of her country, which consists not only of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies of wild animals and in Nature Iraq's educational programs for six years now.</seg>

<seg id="538">Six years after the tsunami: the state of affairs in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School to Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by the tsunami on 11 March 2011 and still occupied the region with reconstruction.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo, which was responsible for northeastern Japan, documented the progress achieved over the last six years to reconstruct the lives of those affected by the "triple catastrophe" of March 2011. a huge earthquake, tsunami and nuclear accident in Fukushima had triggered the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in the prefecture of Miyagi. the prefecture of Miyagi was one of the prefectures in Japan's Northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and neighbouring Fukushima and Iwate neighborhoods were evacuated, because the tsunami had caused entire coastal cities to disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, the prefecture of Fukushima had an atomic accident, alone that alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The Kahoku Shimpo's special report shows from a local point of view what progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both the statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority and the survey results of the affected persons themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">Housing in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare-houses (part of the community, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was able to record the biggest success among the three prefectures, 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed here.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima with 70 percent makes the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">At the same time, six years after the catastrophe, the evacuation of housing shelters (part of the part, casetsu juutaku) must be relocated to final spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate still lived in such homes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Nearly 40 percent of the evacuation from Fukushima in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful in this respect. more than 75 percent of evacuation evacuated after the disaster in temporary shelters were resettled in final homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">The number here is 34 percent for Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="559">The status of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has been able to determine, 1074 of 1100 schools affected by misfortune have opened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of fishing ports have resumed their operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and nuclear accident have affected large areas in the three prefectures of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 per cent of the agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic accident, as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural land from Fukushima lie in the "nuclear blackout zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures tourism has recovered largely, but also here Fukushima stays far away.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are again up to 90 percent at the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only have 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to obtain an overall picture, the paper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuates. it asked them about the status of reconstruction and also how their empathy has changed compared to the tsunami-risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shipo conducted a survey in order to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents took measures to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents said that it was still not done enough in the field of disaster prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to evacuate from the prefecture of Fukushima</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacuation of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima did not only have to witness the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima prefecture was also a witness to the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">Almost 63,000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture of 160 000 evacuation from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, some more than 23,000 people were moved back to Fukushima, in permanent replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">According to the 2017 stand still 40,000 inhabitants live outside of Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas most of the evacuation stations are older than 50 years old. it is well known that the efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima need to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people meet people from other countries speaking another language, the differences seem to be larger than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often sees that one connects more than it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices, broaden our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices podcast, we look at these global connections. in our Into the Deep Podcast we treat issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country boundaries.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Tori Egherman explains how the love of music prevailed for Iranian culture; Adriana Macias talks about the time she worked with people from around the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences he collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week into the intensive care unit: last Friday, a police officer accused him during a demonstration in Goiânia with a strike against his head. millions of demonstrators took part in a protest march against austerity.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studied social sciences at the Federal University of Goiás, suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated this Saturday and now moved him into an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local photo journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, spreading rapidly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a stick. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of Goiás announced that Sampaio was suspended until the end of the investigation into the incident.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officer as he strikes in Goiânia with his stock on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer was beaten up by a demonstrator and landing on the intensive care unit, his face would be on television for six months and the entire oppression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desolalizador," a media group of media activists from Goiânia, shared the video recorded by Luiz da Luz on the net in which one sees how Mateus is attacked by the police officer and several paramters hasten to it.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, but filmed from a different perspective, has also appeared in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the clip shown below, you can see the attack on Mateus from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the Mateus family who lives in another state, Internet users have donated 10,000 Brasilian relays (about 2,700 Euro) to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in Goiânia while he is in the hospital.</seg>

<seg id="613">Goiás experiences a wave of political violence: here the activist Guilherme Irish was assassinated by his father because he supported the Occupy movement in secondary schools. here, the military police of a WhatsApp group participated, only to criminalize teachers, and now we have the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who has been attacked by a police officer who has struck him with a strike.</seg>

<seg id="615">Goiás was not the only state in Brazil where brutal police action against demonstrators was launched last Friday.</seg>
<seg id="616">Police were at protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had set up a stage for orators, rubber floors and tear gas.</seg>
<seg id="617">The MP Flavio Serafini, Socialist and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to renounce loud speakers of violence against demonstrators.</seg>

<seg id="625">The Unforsaken Villages in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso nearly hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba closed doors (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The village of Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, which is located in the western Cuban province of Mayabque, is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill, despite the fact that there is no significant sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It was two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralysed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the fall, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory was gradually losing its facilities until the skeleton of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commuting daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran who stands up every day at 4: 00 a.m., the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region that are in operation after a long inactive time, because they were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene recalls that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">Sugar cane industry already resisted plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, bad administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for concern for the country several decades ago, but the bad harvests are no more news.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the municipality already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated and hardly competitive they became unbearable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production goal was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis in the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose once more than a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar has to remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report published by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agriculture and Food Organization, according to the 2016 report.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate approximately $85 million for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will certainly go into history," "" "these were the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, a total of 98 sugar cane factories came to a halt, more than 65 million people received their full salary for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez has worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">When Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, is the word he repeated the most, "scam."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents agree with the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first half of the year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was a matter of officially recorded documents, which differ only to the parts which would be removed, the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any demolocation.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on the responsibility was taken over and the letters were getting more and more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was in charge of the factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation," he affirmed.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, is waiting for retirement in another facility, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in the decommissioning of the factory, in whose construction he helped.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations communities throughout Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do it by hip-hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile audio studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the pedagogue David Hodges who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked with the Cree Hip-Hop-Group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop thus assumes that the young participants in talks like "cultural identity, language, debate, love, self acceptance," or whatever comes into mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the youngsters are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the trunk of Winnebago in Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the territory of the tribe of the Kitsummum First Nation in British Columbia tells, for example, the history of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a section in western Canada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mostly not solved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey the importance of preserving traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people are not always native to the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved were given some help from Gary Jolly from Northstars Hip-Hop-Group, who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the verse is available in transcription, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on earth</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day when you will hear our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we have lost our way in life as a youth</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">This is how they can grow and move forward as well as our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they intended for the Creator</seg>
<seg id="713">In the comment section, the reader and proponent of the Cree language Kevin Brousseau also makes a contribution and adds the verse to syllables (which is also published on his blog and published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan, plastic dishes can be seen in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers exactly on the menu, in the vicinity of the entrance shokuhin sanitary puru (a part of the best, "plastic models of the dishes") are issued by any dish that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether they will enter or continue the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic courts.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo district of Kappabashi there are a large number of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic courts are so common that they do not attract them even more. however, a new trend is turning them today into showy mobile accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">Naver Matome published the blogger itinii series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new mobile phone decorated with plastic dishes as shown at the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been turned into kitschy collectibles, as in this case, refrigerator magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few shooters fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food items is becoming increasingly more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an imperial-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was turned into a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also manufactured this part for the Tokyo exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your cell phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phones and mobile phones allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, ikura or laughter is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there anyone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my cell phone with laughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appetizing form, for example to surprise coworkers or family members unpleasantly.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and handybands made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Further whimsical plastic dishes can be viewed at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow the hashtag # Twitter hashtag # for a few of the details.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, dedicated to supplying the restaurant industry, for example with the shokuhin sanitary puru.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the infamous "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the missing and gearing regularly appear in statistics. however, these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">"" "" "" "reporting on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, head of the Sinaloa cartel, completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background." ""</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the grieving or the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind every body, behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">This is why the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "live with drug trafficking"), which aims to give these victims a voice and stories of people who were in the struggle between the law enforcement agencies and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime not only allows us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to go many kilometers in order to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>

<seg id="774">"" "" "" "we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community conflicts, fragility and governance." ""</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this contribution from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been familiar with illness and sensationalism for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I pass newspaper kiosks every day and see the front pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from specialists of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to that body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues writing:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks that he wants to become Narco (German: drug traffickers) when he is big. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something like that happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the hopelessness of the people is incredible for me, when the death of six people and the enforced disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village may be justified by being" "" "soaking up" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to argue that they are spared from such tragedies when they are not stirring and still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article "Four months of blackmail in the capital district:" as a family with threats was looted, "she describes how armed criminals squeezed money from their business for month until they had torn down not only the business, but also tore their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain of it never fades, the trauma stays, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The further we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will kidnap you or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">In these terrible days, I wondered if my tears would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the reply is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "the journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega released the contribution" "" "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation marked by violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of Mexico's most dangerous city?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a orphan and he tells us that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, fry potato, keep tortillas warm and make "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells about the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years earlier when he only removed a few blocks from his home, saw the bloody corpse of his father, who was shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, as a violation of organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the citizens' council for public security and the government of the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor's office counted 3103 killings. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 killings per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of stories that leave organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories are still living in the face of new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal Político entered into life the data journalism project Narcodata, whose goal is to portray the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has plagued the country in the last four decades, in an intelligible way.</seg>

<seg id="818">The fact-check is important at a moment when it comes to raising a rumor or exposing a falsification.</seg>
<seg id="819">But what is the years after something has appeared for the first time? content in social media, whether it's true or untrue, tends to continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this picture of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first release, it has been misused to illustrate tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This misppling of picture and event - "false description" or "wrong context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is abundant meticulous coverage of events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for pictures to messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010 a tank truck crossed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, kicked around and exploded. 230 people died there.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war Africa's second largest country had been neglected for years and thus ravaged. the streets in the region became dangerous paths filled with potholes that were difficult to sail.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank car fell victim to it.</seg>
<seg id="828">Representatives of the authorities described a fireball that enveloped dozens of houses, including a cinema nearby, full of people watching the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses burned and charred corpses lay in the streets scattered.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were incinerated to lack of knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture titled "Das ist Nigeria." from Imgur user Mystical Monkey, January 12, 2015.Several photos of the incident depict the horrible scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows lined bodies lined up on the floor while people look at it.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo was recorded several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, and falsely attributed to real but not related tragedies, in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened and what didn't happen in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters from Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses drastically reported atrocities they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one was left to count bodies," "" "said an inhabitant on Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the follow-up time could be depicted figuratively.</seg>
<seg id="844">The occasion for the attack was also unclear, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the Boko Haram's attempt to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo reappeared, as it was wrongly presented as proof of the fact and potential magnitude of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of false attributions; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the picture was presented as a proof of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further, personal comments such as this example mistakenly counterpose the image of the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in order to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Sange appeared in connection with the fatal prosecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash report published by the United Nations, those who could flee, rape, rape and some dead, some through burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported violence against the Rohingya, posts like the following, brought together these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi news page, which was falsely claimed in 2012, Myanmar's Thein being said, monks and politicians were involved in the murder of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, they had used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate this information.</seg>

<seg id="899">Nigeria, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="900">Even within Nigeria, the photo from the DR Congo became a proof of the bombings of Boko Haram in Kano in public discussion forums.</seg>
<seg id="901">Malaysia, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="902">Malaysia offers two extreme examples of abusive use of the image from the DR Congo, on the one hand a tweet that expresses sympathy towards the Nigerian massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blogger, the assertions that Rohingya are persecuted, to delicate, since the photos were used improperly.</seg>

<seg id="905">This position, which was exclusively published in English, also includes references to fake images of smells used by Hate Speech and used by extremist groups to demonstrate that Muslims kill Buddhists and vice versa (which is often spread by Burmese nationalists).</seg>
<seg id="906">"" "Russia, 2012." "" "fetal equation?" "" "(Christianophobia or political provocation?)." ""</seg>
<seg id="907">This post addressed to members of the Russian Orthodox community clearly states that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims who kill Christians.</seg>
<seg id="908">Saudi Arabia, 2012 / 2014.</seg>
<seg id="909">This news page falsely claimed that the president of Myanmar Thein admitted His 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Rohingya Muslims and brought the story along with the image from Sange.</seg>
<seg id="910">The article was updated in 2014 and the picture is still contained in it at the time of this publication.</seg>
<seg id="911">Spain, 2015 / 2016.</seg>
<seg id="912">This article from 2014 about students who had been killed by the Boko Haram published by the news page Análisis Digital, which is now deleted from the Catholic close to the Catholic, has expressly declared that the image does not originate from the killings, but it claims that it constitutes a "similar jihadist attack."</seg>
<seg id="913">When the picture was later put into circulation in connection with the Boko Haram massacre of 2015, the newspaper El Pais tried to refute that there were connections to Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="914">"" "Turkey, 2015." "" "# NijeryaYanıyordunyaUyuy" "" "(Nigeria burns, the world sleeps)." ""</seg>
<seg id="915">The image of the DR Congo, endowed with this Twitterhashtag, triggered a discussion among Muslims following the Boko Haram massacre in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted their communities to pay greater attention to these events which took place in the name of Islam.</seg>
<seg id="917">United States, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The image was weathered as evidence of the Boko Haram massacre in 2015 (and retweded more than 9,300 times), but the messages related to it were not taken up in any religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (Vietnamese), 2014.</seg>
<seg id="921">After a message allegedly written by a "Father Juan Carlos Martos" about the Nigerian massacre, there were discussion forums like this in Vietnamese and explained it to false announcement.</seg>
<seg id="922">From the message in which the image from the DR Congo was included, the organization of the missionaries and Father Juan Carlos Martos distanced himself.</seg>
<seg id="923">There are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="924">On other accounts, aggregators and pages in the following countries (on the map in grey), TinEye also points, but are no longer fully traceable: Czech Republic, Australia, India, Peru, Netherlands, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan, Japan and possibly China.</seg>
<seg id="925">(data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the crawler and occasionally they have picture file names in connection with Nigeria or Rohingya Muslims.)</seg>
<seg id="926">In all these cases, which only appeared clearly after the original piece of 2010, the picture may ultimately have a correct description, but the original contribution is not available or accessible.</seg>
<seg id="927">Frames and images</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (frames) that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence related to the killings of Christians through Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the killings of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">"" "" "" "with social media, there are umpteen people who inadvertently share the water around a tragedy." ""</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggests this mood of misinformation and falsehood that actual atrocities are untrue and diminish the real horror of what has actually happened in DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The proliferation of violent images has already been debated in detail (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that withholding images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these images are even required by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images sensitize readers and spectators, and they have the ability to feel empathy (for example, this study that examined how violent media work to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss with regard to violent depictions in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news coverage.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experiment with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which actually can also be used by the context or in a completely improper way.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, any investigation of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e.g. insurmountable) strives to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not at all to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">There are such words in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese dinosaur) and others deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish Sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But everyone stubbornly resists any attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or an expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes a context is needed in order to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online-list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists cover Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">The blog contains, for example, words from the VATclap language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - get tired of your parents in recognition of your efforts in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words spoken in the language of Hunsrik, which are spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The comfort or laziness that you feel after you have warmed up on cold days in the sun.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They unveil other cultures, reveal other thoughts and arouse our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page want to publish more of these "irreplaceable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.</seg>
<seg id="958">Speakers of the Treasure Languages, which are highly appreciated by untranslatable, are invited to upload their favorite wines here.</seg>

<seg id="970">The island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and landslide disaster in this decade.</seg>
<seg id="971">Caused by the monsoon, which usually starts at the end of May, the rivers Kalu, Kelani, Gin, Nilwala and Attanagalu Oya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country have entered the banks by heavy rainfalls.</seg>
<seg id="972">Following a statement by the Sri Lankan Katastrophy of 28 May 2017, 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people were missed because of the floods and mud winds.</seg>
<seg id="973">More than 400,000 people have been affected since last Friday (26 May) and about 100,000 people have been brought to 304 safe places.</seg>
<seg id="974">Rain dropped on Saturday (27 May) and the water levels in some areas went slowly back.</seg>
<seg id="975">Health and hygiene conditions of the population constitute a massive challenge in the affected and still inaccessible areas.</seg>
<seg id="976">The following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the flood disaster:</seg>
<seg id="977">Tap water in Tawalama City with water levels of up to 7.5 meters. Twitter users like Azzam Ameen and Sri Lanka Tweet provide regular updates to the flood situation.</seg>
<seg id="978">Many use the hashtag # FloodSL to monitor the extent of the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="979">Sri Lanka's deadly cures worsen the denial crisis, warns Save the Children after further rainfalls are already on their way.</seg>
<seg id="980">This morning the Neluwa bus stood in the floodwater, water level up to 6 meters. Moragoda village near Galle also flooded due to the water level of the Morogoda Ela.</seg>
<seg id="981">The Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and another five are managed to transport emergency supplies for the residents included in their flooded villages.</seg>
<seg id="982">Various organizations and startups have also been helping to help.</seg>
<seg id="983">Facebook pages like Help Flood Victims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Disaster Relief - Information Desk- Sri Lanka provide important information about flood situations and humanitarian aid.</seg>
<seg id="984">If any search and rescue teams need drones for their operations, please call 0774844639.</seg>
<seg id="985">For those who want to donate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -</seg>
<seg id="986">Today we are in the area around Keleniya and Himbutana.</seg>
<seg id="987">Please call 0777449729 or 0777843841 today if you need help in this field.</seg>
<seg id="988">The Taxi Service app PickMe (Sri Lanka) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Catastophencentre is informed.</seg>
<seg id="989">Last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Roanu, Pickme introduced a "flood help" key which allowed users to call a vehicle to collect assistance and donations. these were then forwarded to the Sri Lankan Red Cross for free.</seg>
<seg id="990">They also launched a SOS button, which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people trapped by flooding and landslides.</seg>
<seg id="991">The combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka, in which several social media platforms are fully exploited, bring citizens in need of security and provide help measures.</seg>
<seg id="992">This has prevented the loss of other human lives, whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore normalcy.</seg>

<seg id="1002">I have already managed this conversation.</seg>

<seg id="1004">They abducted me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We don't all look the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We are practicing our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves to be a Muslim, in different ways. but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims do not fit into it, they must be abducted.</seg>
<seg id="1010">To be abducted</seg>
<seg id="1011">I don't stand alone with it.</seg>

<seg id="1016">When Jalaluddin Rumi was as old as I am now, he was an Orthodox Muslim preacher and scholar.</seg>
<seg id="1017">Islam, the Quran and Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry by the day he died.</seg>
<seg id="1018">But in the Western notion, religion was erased as well as from the most popular translations of its poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1019">This deleting renders a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world.</seg>

<seg id="1025">I worked for thirteen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful, flawed narrative dominates our newsfeeds.</seg>
<seg id="1026">This narrative overshadowed the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries, while the USA could not even choose their first female Presidential candidate.</seg>
<seg id="1027">This narrative fails to recognise that when French, Muslim women are prevented from wearing their headscarf in public buildings, and Saudi-Arab, Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body, both of which are two sides of the same coin.</seg>

<seg id="1031">It deletes the existence of queer Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This narrative has so deeply and incorrectly occupied our collective imagination, that often Sikh men and children become the target of anti-Muslim attacks and harassment.</seg>
<seg id="1033">Because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them, Islamophobia is today not just fear of Islam, religion, but it is fear of the "other."</seg>
<seg id="1034">Among the 1.7 billion things belong</seg>
<seg id="1035">In the news industry, we do more than telling stories that are based on facts.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Or on alternative facts.</seg>
<seg id="1037">We also create poisons that help us to understand the world.</seg>

<seg id="1135">History of history, by Flickr-user Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling initiative (TLS), telling stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices recently reported about a different initiative by Steven Bird, the unmistakable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">However, the focus of TLS is not on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of languages of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already held events since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project, the following applies:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces where people don't have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening to" "" "is often associated with" "" "listening to these events" "" "instead" "" "listening to, feeling, feeling, socializing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers introduce their story first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even though the participants are not a professional story teller, their devotion and their portrayal lead to the audience's commitment to it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions as if the language no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for their country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyammerara tells the fables of the rabbit and the baboon in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the significance of his navel, John Nyammerara is asked: "how is it to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a wide grin, he shares his feeling of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You listened to it!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. anyone who is inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytelling tours.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the objective of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounted to 72 million US dollars, various religious and civil organizations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017. the march began with the Moroccan Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juan.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and members continue to campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">This year's re: Publica, the annual conference on the digital culture hosted in Berlin, devoted itself to the event of the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the French-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, managing director at Book Sprints, a publishing house produced by so-called 'Book Sprints' produced within three to five days, read extracts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Liberty: a Collective Study).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book published last year and is available here license-free contains a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built up and what is the real cost associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look over the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense from our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartoum, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was crossed out of the directory of the Adra prisons, in which he sat on October 3, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then we have no information about his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective Memory gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have let us start thinking about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What have we chosen for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we abandoned at times of extreme beliefs in this process?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody by Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015 Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military facility, to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi reported that the "Military Police" Bassel had taken part in Adra's military court in Adra on the basis of a command of the military court. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by people who were inside the Assad government on 12 November 2015 and informed them about an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">However, his place of residence and condition remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of the cultural prototypes had been more pretentious than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the cross of numerous civilizations, and here Greek-Roman architecture merge with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel could not know at that time that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would make everything possible to wipe out this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">"" "" "" "tragically, Bassel could not finish this project yet." ""</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life in dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English, even when he was already in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with anyone who has asked. he has taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners, how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually having one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a proposition that she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together on the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English.</seg>

<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted with anger to an attack on corruption, in which a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state machine after half of his sentence, in which the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">It is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and, in 2010, was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants because of the misappropriation of 54 million Metikal (about 800 000 Euros).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the Mozambique airports, whose council held Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 due to good leadership and immediately called for his re-attitude to the company, which took place on 19 April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which rejected the request, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to resume his old post as the company did not pursue disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not mean the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, condemned the company's decision to put the director back in an interview with Deutsche Welle:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a step backward with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the firm should also initiate a disciplinary action against the counter-counter.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company apparently kept silent and did not make reasonable legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "EgÃ ídio Vaz, an important voice in the Mozambican social media, also rejects this behaviour and considers the case as" "" "disgusting" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent guy, he would be an advisor after having been sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But as he is incompetent, he has agreed to be reintegrated into the company that helped him harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Undisgusting!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says that the director has no moral whatsoever:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insulted him, I can't believe somebody is rewarded in such a way that the state has already insulted so heavily.</seg>
<seg id="1273">"" "" "" "Cambaza lacks morality and serves the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served the state himself." ""</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as if it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, that a thief enters prison:</seg>

<seg id="1287">"" "the Burmese word" "" "Kalar pae" "" "means chickpeas or splitting bangs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia comons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network adopted their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally use as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook greets the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or as part of a part of the initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically recall hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts in which they discussed the use of the word have been censored for their use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same character sequence as' kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, the chair is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (splitting bse), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalcaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Faceboosier Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty way if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a play of words.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet is convinced that it will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before it extinguishes all posts that are suspected of circulating racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "Facebook does not delete the word" "" "Kalar" "" "manually." ""</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism won't understand what you are writing on Faceook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the mail and control it by checking the adjacent words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (splitting bsen).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate speech, receive a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to all who spread hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat proved that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks can simply start using a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts, when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banished from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new directive by Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to read, post and share content for 24 hours because the post "didn't meet the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his mail was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author expressed his opinions on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khan believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community to ask for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes to have a benevolent intention to lessen racism in Burma through its platform, but that's not how it works.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as "stool" or "peas curry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the wrongly deleted posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they would only have a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook automatic censorship has caused a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and deliberately write the word 'Kalar' in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that didn't include hate speech but were removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "the Burmese text reads" "" "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian film." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "only to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word" "" "Kalar" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1334">"" "the post says" "" "If you are a doctor, then heal people?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should additionally stimulate violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in the area of Rakhine, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was criticised for his failure to control the exuberant hate speech on his Burmese sites.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of simply censoring the word "Kalar," it would have been better working on context than initiatives focused on code and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1345">Before this change of the marriage, some members of Hindu and Muslim religious groups adhered to the practice, and in May 2016 there was a great public outcry. at that time, brother Harrypersad Maharaj, a group of representatives of the various religious groups of the country, said that the state should not interfere as that, age does not determine maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">"" "this happened regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago are a contractual partner of the UN Convention on Children Rights," "" "minors as" "", "every man under the age of 18" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics from the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of children who were married to 15 in Trinidad and Tobago was 2.8 percent, and at 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the Federal Statistical Office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 in 1997-2007.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements aimed at creating laws for children's marriage followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. without a doubt they helped to bring about this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "a Hindu Guide, for example, had no qualms about telling the critics of the children's marriage, they should, condemns themselves, to take care of their own affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this really uncomplicated matter, and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree with the bill of law at all.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the bill against the children's marriage was decided - despite 4 Senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent who abstained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him the law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country must agree and let the law be proclaimed.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators gave a status update on Facebook, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the children's marriage was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and none of them voted against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After deciding beforehand in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media users were thrilled, because the laws for highs were finally changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who is clothed in a ministerial ministry in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">There has been too much time and unnecessary talk that has veiled the core of the matter, but do you know what? the children's marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that is worth almost every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Whereas Abel Jackson thought it was definitely long enough to abolish the practice, Lara Quentral-Thomas was overjoyed that the day was finally coming:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public Status update on Facebook by Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which states:, Excellent news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The Act has been adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, votes - 35 for it - 0 against it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">The Mutota, which belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group, who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was, noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The age of marriage in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious affiliation 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The plan to amend the married couple was decided today, on June 9, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">There were 41 members in the House of Representatives and 35 of them were present at the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All MEPs who were present have voted for the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">The children's marriage is not allowed in Trinidad and Tobago by law.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long battle (...)</seg>
<seg id="1372">Many thanks to all the activists who fought it.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A thank you to our MEPs.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a possible catch comes in the shape of Sat Maharaj, the Secretary General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organisation in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago Maharaj has announced his intention to take legal action, the law should be adopted, and he seems to release his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While Attorney General Paris Al rawi, advocate of the law, said that it was quite legitimate if Maharaj wanted to go against the law, most social media users wished that the debate on the subject would be different.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell proposed:</seg>
<seg id="1379">"" "instead of talking about the problem, instead of talking about the problem, instead of talking about the problem, we would say that the state, which protects our daughters from preventing them from large, hard-boiled men who are in favour of them," "" "would you then be ready to continue the discussion?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But whether it comes to court proceedings against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where children's marriage is legal or is still the norm, although there are laws that prohibit them.</seg>

<seg id="1390">Mirroring web pages allows Turkish users to view Wikipedia content</seg>
<seg id="1391">The english language Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA, internationally obscured.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month now Turkey has blocked the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day becomes clearer how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blockage.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech-savvy Internet users are used to use circumnavigation tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking Article from Wikipedia since 2008, as recently published in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Law (No. 5651) has been adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, there are now several mirrors (pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and are often updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform deposited all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized, peer-to-peer network (i.e. host computer connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">In spite of the legal ban, the content is accessible.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After listening to the news (via the block of Wikipedia), we started to take snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the content in a decentralized and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia-Foundation, and it merely concerns screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to bypass the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a mirrorpage of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirror sites when locked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member and staff at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access another URL that is not the original. that which you can see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server redirects the request to the correct Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia, even if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">This is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurry with badly positioned motifs and washed colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to wear a camera and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepali wildlife to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown, right next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook, how this first-class location helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live on the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when I suddenly called in Navarre (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my father that a leopard would be on the banks of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had watched him and showed me the place on the other river side, where the Leopard was and I immediately started to kneel pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar seeks cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, for he stood before the face of the tiger face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Bedtime for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the bush appeared. he immediately sat down, we look at us and he stares me through the scarf-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar places the logo "I click for conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on its photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the advancement of Neptune nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent in order to take pictures of Ottern in the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodations.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This post was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women with the greatest care are to avoid the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "instead they use a pronouns or say" "" "father of my child" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that because of the social pressure they respect the husband, as well as fear of the consequences, they should respect the norm to keep this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian state of Odisha by a fake court and rejected by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married couple with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of naming their wives not by name is also common among men. however, they have far fewer rights to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel and housewives, joined a unique club and became the main topic of discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, he is part of the # KhelBadal campaign, which is run by the community Video Volunteers and campaigning for the dismantling of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pahas been working for seven years with the help of their video camera on the discovery of practices, such as children's marriage, the exile of HIV and AIDS patients, and manages these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She tells how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video showing Rohini in her discussion was women who did not name their husbands on behalf.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this issue because she wanted to open the discussion on the patriarchy with a problem with which women could easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not uttering the name of their husbands is a custom that they are all dutifully upheld and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is regarded as deceitful as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this round of discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband in the name of her husband, wanted to try out at home as it is.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini recounts:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said that I should call him by his name from now on." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini started her first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" before. some believed it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then they all asked," "" "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us what they want, does that mean they don't respect us?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they took the name of their husbands on their lips," says Rohini Paz from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about the Break of a secular tradition in which married women never can pronounce the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini recounts:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she was only kneeling in front of herself during the whole exercise; another decided to release all the pent-up frustration against him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the rush of adrenaline about having broken with an ancient tradition, the women decided they would actually try their husbands at home.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a large number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put into the head of women: his wife couldn't stop telling his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another member of the club decided to do it during dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini said I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation dealt with in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinc-red dot on the forehead, which shows the marriage status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"" "I said to my husband that I would carry the" "" "zinced" "" "point if he did it too." ""</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not stopped completely with it, but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make an excursion with each discus club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear what" "", "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and spoke about things about which they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, for example, how our identities are tied to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say something loud, no matter how small they are.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only carried saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most people, that's okay, but some wanted to wear a Salad Kurta, a wide shirt over a pants, they didn't dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of his own dress code, the morals associated with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled her own couple of Kurtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion round, so that the women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to go on a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will do it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether something has changed in the five months since their first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things are getting rolling slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have only made small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, still do it, but only when they are alone and there are no other family members.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberred on their foreheads at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discus club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the viola for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How to explain Rohini:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each one of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman walks home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1549">On June 29th of this year, the hashtag was a part of the "The Beatles Memorial Day" in Japan's Twitter trend, where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The visit of the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a turning point in the Japanese culture of the postwar period.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who interviewed the Beatles in London in 1964, noted in 2016 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the first visit:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just under five days the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to let the Japanese go through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The people here quickly realized that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many known Japanese sizes had reached their zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The music of the cult band is "more than just a universal language like English," said Ryuichi Isaka, President of the retail giant Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>
<seg id="1556">"" "good morning!" "" "today the Beatles Memorial Day is in Japan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1557">Also today songs of the Beatles are sung in Japanese karaoke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools.</seg>
<seg id="1558">The kitsch of the Beatles survives everything.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Today is the day of the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1560">We all love the Beatles in our house.</seg>
<seg id="1561">I don't know if this "Winnie the Pooh" doll is John Lennon or not.</seg>
<seg id="1562">And as it is for fans, Japanese make pilgrimages to the well-known places that are connected with the band.</seg>
<seg id="1563">If you love the Beatles, this is your 5 places you must necessarily visit.</seg>
<seg id="1564">1) Abbey Road</seg>
<seg id="1565">2) Mathew Street (in Liverpool)</seg>
<seg id="1566">3) Strawberry Fields (memorial in New York)</seg>
<seg id="1567">4) Penny Lane</seg>
<seg id="1568">5) (From the link) The Beatles Story (Museum), Liverpool</seg>
<seg id="1569">The pilgrimages can sometimes not be whimsical enough:</seg>
<seg id="1570">Good morning together.</seg>
<seg id="1571">Today is the day of the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1572">Just in 1966, the Beatles came to Japan for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">The characters from the film K-On! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across the Abbey Road.</seg>
<seg id="1574">We did the same last year.</seg>
<seg id="1575">And of course some companies also use the fan base in terms of marketing, such as the Ramen Shop (Ramen are Japanese noodles) in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Good morning, here is Mutahiro Koya Ramen! part of today is The Beatles Memorial Day.</seg>
<seg id="1577">And what could that be for a day?</seg>
<seg id="1578">"" "today I will listen to" "" "Yesterday" "" "and eat Ramen noodles at Mutaro Koya." ""</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping of bald individuals for organ trafficking, presumably for superstitious purposes, is worried by the police of Zambézia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called a series of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometers from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was found beheaded and part of the organs were taken.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently informed that the bodies of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi were used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There are local superstitions that the head of a bald man could contain gold or bring wealth, the police spokesman of Zambézia of the BBC declared.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the aim of murders for obscure purposes, are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that the UN 2016 in the South African country conducted a mission to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of Southern Africa, especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to fight this superstition and prejudice.</seg>

<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, province of Zambézia, for presumably superstitious rituals, has given cultural motives and is given by the traditional shamans, which also indicates that a faith exists, according to which the victims in the head might have power, the riches generated.</seg>

<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo drew attention in the international community after his attorney announced at the end of June that he had been hospitalized due to liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009 Liu was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for "Subversion" (state endangerment) after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto calling for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred Lius case as" "" "an internal affair" "" "and told a speaker that he deemed it" "" "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China is still receiving calls from the international community, the Nobel prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to release or permit him a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticised the severe treatment of the couple in Beijing, other countries have completely wiped out the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has consolidated some reactions abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exert pressure to allow Liu to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway and Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende refused to answer questions about Liu's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that it was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June, Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon exports to China, as exports have largely been blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for an unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union - European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately release Liu and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat in the EU, Federica Mogherini, also urged China to release Liu as she announced in a statement on June 30:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to raise all restrictions from Mr. Liu's wife and family members.</seg>

<seg id="1663">Canada City South Africa</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum called on China to provide Liu with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius attorney told AFP earlier that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that it is not allowed to speak and contact with someone outside, including his lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues to say:</seg>

<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he was severely punished, would have led to a more harmonious, stable and prosperous China, which in turn contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, signed the Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>

<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid, since Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association, the Minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore to other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people commit a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the Cavalierio blog accuses the Minister of Justice to" "" "twist logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, we can say that we are ultimately no country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very classy: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other "normal countries" in view of this, he would inevitably appear undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, as well as cities that are permanently run by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core of the subject, the good old lyre appears again from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic because it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, the responses to his American guests in the last week of Shanmugam were really non-responses to his American guests regarding our press, our judicial system, our political system.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He camouflaged corresponding questions with non-replies of rational nature.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls on Shanmugam to show his opinions as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally, I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country but a city, so to what country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to elucidate this point as long as it was paid high to be part of the government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his commentary on the blog, he points out the critics that one should start reading the entire transcript of the conference so that one can better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">When he said that Singapore was more of a "city" than a country, he explained why the elections in Singapore were so unequal even if we enjoy free and fair elections.</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore to cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said that Singapore" "" "is not a country," "" "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who as leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - I agree with them or not, but that's another matter.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of Singapore's political leaders, I doubt and I am not even sure if he really believes this, associates properly and is aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review outlines the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "did Herr Shanmugam committed" "" "a mistake" "" "or was it a udder advocate?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only viewed as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, what country will the sovereign rights of Singapore return to?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the government cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of weighty significance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapore afford their military service, but do they defend their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who has to pay back our prime minister bills?</seg>

<seg id="1780">A pop band known in Thailand has released a music video which parodies the Junta who took power in 2014 and, in spite of their promises to restore the civilian government, continues to rule the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells the rules his girlfriend makes.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not expressly political, the music video refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the Junta.</seg>

<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially as it concerns the situation of the country under the Junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these videos of the video, which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years.</seg>

<seg id="1807">Villages such as Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Kharshava are located in the basin of Abkhazia.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups like Russians, Greeks, Depths, Georgians and Armenians lived and worked together in Soviet sites in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their homes during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, most of the Russians and chickens live in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also known as ghosts in Abkhazia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">During the pre-war period more than 10,000 people lived here, today there are only a few hundred people in these ghosts.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic of Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the entire population of the district has been 16,000 people, having barely risen for over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989, about 43.000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken has been published on April 19, 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org and appears here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants entering Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is run by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink brick frame and gold colored earrings in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel doesn't have any charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For approximately 2.50 dollars per night guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the vestibule there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Haitian migrants are coming here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez tells, the people come in full small buses and from the upper part of the coast they start shouting: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some slept outside on cardboard.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, they buy drugs they cannot pay, they massage them with a balm the feet exhausted by the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was a reasonable nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>

<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children there.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then move north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">"" "the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." "" "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," "" "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">He says that Haitians and Africans often travel along the road and that Africans already talk about Whatsapp by Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a building worker on the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our Mother and we never leave her again," "" "he responds smiling." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez tells her guests often send text messages when they are left to greet them or to report on the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the driving force of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city, a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have welcomed migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and found out that the bus tickets to many African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border across the desert and we have suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula arrive from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me he has fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children from people who wanted to blackmail him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, a single educator, offered him their roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step is to go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa, everything is full of guests again.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses travellers calmly consult their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but it is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother, she flatters with numerous photos in her album.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair weaving, she has made a female, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly while she introduces her to me.</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">Check-in for personal communication devices in Xinjiang by Twitter users</seg>
<seg id="1961">The residents of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan District of the city Urumqi received a mobile phone alert, in which they instruct the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the message it is said that the app" "" "prevents access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the authorities cemented the app for more than fighting terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia, ten Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because they had messed up messages with a private WeChat group shortly after they installed the app.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the communication of the police, the app would determine and track the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwang website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is blocking pornographic web pages, from online fraud, trojans and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and to remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filtering for minors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While messages about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and discontent in conflict areas, the authorities often associate extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The Twitter-based Media Outlet "Images from mainland China" (a few blocks), which has published censored news in China, displayed photos from a checkpoint where policemen randomly checked the residents if they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile message demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected on a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be detained up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people to use appliances intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity through the translation technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" (a few blocks) also published a Jingwang product description, from which it emerges that the software can lift the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus get unlimited access to the hard drive of the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang computer and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a response to the instructions of the City Party Council to minimize dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and affiliated institutions, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office on the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report of Freedom House, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new monitoring methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, the authorities published an ordinance with the instruction to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards" at local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist" videos. however, this action violates the rights rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole series of other possible offenses, including those referring to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he shifts to his screen, sometimes to his computer, back and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives on the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family had forced herself to flee from her village in Palestine, in which they lived as felahyees (e.g.: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist opposing the conservative majority and questioning its well-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rape.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with themes such as orialism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all of these subjects are not only relevant in his hometown of Amman, but also in cities which range from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">At the age of 25, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not constrained by boundaries in his mind, and he can sympathise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he doesn't admit it openly, he hates a special aversion to U.S. foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, have anything to do with his identity as a "Palestinian refugee of the second generation" - so he denotes himself even when he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think so because of my own circumstances," "" "Hdaib stresses." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so, because I am a man," while he pours in water dissolved Nescafé into two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; at this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Evidently, Hdaib has a certain weakness in breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with protests against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">In principle, the pieces of lukewarm coffee and the squadrons of the Kent-cigarette are in the nose primarily of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially if you have a look at the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">This is why it is easy to do basic things - how to drink water in the public during the Ramadan - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentarians who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front-singer Hamed Sinno contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the MP and former spokeswoman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "" "just" "" "had been cancelled because of the scary's sexual orientation." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which raises the tried-and-tested legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian nation as a "progressive supporter of human rights," which still decided "to use intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement would probably not be simple rhetoric, but in fact reflect an increasingly clear-crystallizing reality in Jordan, which appears clearly in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib returned to traditional gender norms by forming his vision of the fate of Arab women who have sex-marital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an apparently clouded unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red sea; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those whom they should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past few years, the number of 'honorary morants' has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of voluntary killings reached its peak in 2016, but it is still aggravated that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on crime against crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the risk of domestic violence can "indefinitely be detained in prison," and for their release often a long-term bureaucratic effort and the guarantee on the part of the family are necessary that the woman will not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs's music enjoys great popularity and is known for not shy away from issues that have long been taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression, not politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "politics has been infiltrated to me," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib tackles the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb," the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of the songs that are political at the heart can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">"" "in March 2016 Hdaib published a song titled" "" "Santorano" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song one verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free and everyone else is." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">"" "in the further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where one, in his words," "" "can get what you want" "" "- whether it is faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality." ""</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014 Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular jordanian online program Roya, to note that his comments were torn from context, distorted and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "it was uploaded on Youtube without cuts, but it was only a revised version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib acquires openly for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance towards homosexuals does not correspond to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, still today thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib wonders: if Abu Nuwhat, who was to work later on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why cannot Jordan do this?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemian kingdom there is nothing new anymore that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service held several former government officials and members of the teacher association, arguing that they spoke critically on comments in social media related to the problems rooted in the country's deep-rooted corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaibs's concert is, according to opinion, only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that's Hdaib - consists of slow, thought-out and internal changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to "experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will converge with the help of music, art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, stray unitions and artificial democracies. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until now, Hdaib will continue to rap and consequently resist.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman was a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant puppets are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is assumed that it is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the feasts, drums and dancing have been handed down over more than a thousand years and from a time when armies of west Japan marched into the north-east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the emishi, to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to pick up some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, hosted a two-month exhibition at Wa no Akari (literally).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two fixed cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the journey to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebuchaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The view of a 18 meter high car was incredible.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let's enjoy the rest of the summer!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Outward appearance and body care were rare as in this story, as they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate job such as that of the hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic centre of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where street theft and illegal drug trafficking are everyday.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region did not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for esthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and the unusual styling of famous athletes such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to becoming more and more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairdressers, which go to the ultimate limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There, experts approach each other to show who can create the most eccentric look as you can see in the following video (more videos about current contests are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, which is located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to obtain an education in barber art instead of bad advice that allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops prior to the school year beginning in March and reported on some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995, we were the only vocational school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud because of love for the children, we have built this educational community.</seg>

<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the contribution" "" "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" "" "published by the international online magazine" Tea After Twelve "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel disappointing?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Precisely this question left the young Columbian activists Leonardo Párraga from the foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired her to write to the campaign Carta por la Reconciliación (letters to reconciliation) that encourage young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government closed a peace agreement with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), which forms the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signing of the Peace Treaty was so significant that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">In front of the Colombians there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters who have lived in illegal camps for many years, were exposed to war rhetoric and carried their arms around the clock, must now integrate themselves into the lives of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, in turn, who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take them into their ranks and support them in building up a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that young Columbians would have to join forces and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's what they did: so far, thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrillas to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The campaign's goal is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter who is to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more needful.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people this year, who needed most urgently.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus the plan arose to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now need to find their place in society and build a new life. "the letters will show that Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Up to now more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought anyone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from BogotArt Foundation travelled to the camp to deliver the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC were as they had previously done to accommodate the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," told the political scientist Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambusches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go there, because next to him on the bed was a MGL-Pomegrower, a deadly weapon in Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "he said," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he answered," "" "I am answering a letter that someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "never in my life someone wrote such a beautiful thing, so I answer it." "" "suddenly tears ran over the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat down beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was also tired of war, I was tired of being the faithful companion of this warrior, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers from starvation. "I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know there is a society out there that waits for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">So far, I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices and voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">In the prelude, students and some of the FARC leaders joined a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already there was war and the FARC already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have seen how social injustice on the part of the State worked on the Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can help shape society in this country more just.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "the aim of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles," "" "one of them said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Hearing these people who had never found hearing before and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I often saw as a monster and even hated even people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives is hurting me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians were made to know that peace would reign after disarming.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities exist, there will always be people who are prepared to grab arms, stand up and protest for their rights. and that is fully justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC now focus on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call upon all defenders of peace - regardless of race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a land in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grozny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is currently happening in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">The LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has conquered the international headlines several months ago after reports have been published related to the deportation, torture and killing of queer men in the Republic.</seg>

<seg id="2260">After that the photos of my documents through WhatsApp did the round.</seg>
<seg id="2261">I was attacked on 10 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was just doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying, "Here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "then I heard a sentence, but this time on Chechnya:" "" "how long do you still want to dishonour the family, you Schandfleck?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up at the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had got everything and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two headaches in my right lung wing.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which hospitals were you laid - in the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are out of date, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful to him for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I first read his name at his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for having dealt with me respectfully.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked to send me back to Chechnya to prove that all this was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They found absurd demands: some told me that I had to prove it by running up without going through the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official TV in Grozny saying that I didn't change my gender, that everything was just bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how has your family tried to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people spoke once my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world that has corrupted not only your family, but the whole republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman but you must disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">It was too much for my mother and she laid a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with darkened window panes and a plate with a 95 on it under the window.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time it became clear to me that there was something lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My Human Rights friends reviewed the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to reveal their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help I left the country, but then something incredible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registering without me, without notice, without everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"" "in the moment when I wanted to call my mother on WhatsApp, I got a message:" "" "you don't believe, you are security only because you left the country?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know which hotel you are in. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "only to prove to you: it is the number 115." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">But we don't talk about gender equality, that's a taboo topic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I can't overcome this spiritual barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I am actually trying to see how the person looks like, to whom she remembers from her past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For him I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who has been in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that no people were arrested and tortured during the Ramadan, but also that they could hardly wait for the end of the Ramadan and he did not lock up a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">With this I mean, they probably invite their relatives, they take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end demand proof that the so-called "honour" has experienced satisfaction with blood.</seg>
<seg id="2329">"" "" "" "OC Media:" "" "are gay men still held in these secret prisons?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine said that there weren't so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">When, above all, those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to face Kadyrow's judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that they can be present later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say," "" "Should you be killed, you will show your body on TV and claim that they have attacked some village or a military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but deliberately submerged in order to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this now just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in argun for a year and a half.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person himself was when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, they were not presented as bandits, but there have been no reports so far. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why otherwise would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already occurred in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known in Grozny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was considered, I had never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer at that time than now.</seg>

<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had dyed lashes, wore tubular jeans and short loops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Health of Sharia has never hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches stood and the whole city knew of it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>

<seg id="2365">When he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began to talk about morality in television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us per se, but above the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how people in the city began to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who smiled before and laughed at once looked at you with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In that time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could feel how the situation in the Republic has steadily deteriorated.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you follow now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I still work as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize Teacreffs, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards.</seg>

<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahraz region in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability of his family to rise, so Ahrazi-human rights groups who wish to work in Ahraz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube kept the moments when he had kindled himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors couldn't do anything anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>

<seg id="2411">The region where a large part of the Arab Ahrazi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny its livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahraz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi Monarchy acquired power and in 1925 made great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahraz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population gets little of that wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated illnesses, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime systematically denies the Ahrazi Arabs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a variety of dams, the water from the Arab areas to the Persian areas, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are diverted.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to worsen the devastation caused by dryness, and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab ahawk youth rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian master director for cooperatives, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of Ahrazis, who were looking for a job, completed primary school, completed 55% of secondary school and 45% had a university degree.</seg>

<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahrazi human rights activist with residence in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" in the number of suicide among young Ahrazi men.</seg>

<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their homeland of Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first and last name in order to hide their affiliation to the Ahrazi and to be hired so that even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace, let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances surrounding the Ahrazi, human rights activists beat alarm before the situation will explode.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I do not identify with feminism, even with the intersectional not"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the website Afroféminas. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions came to expression.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women - who call themselves intersectional feminists - have frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They are wondering why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put out well thought-out scientific and societal arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should be feminine in general.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women still earn less money today despite equal education than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women come across a glass ceiling earlier or later in various spheres of life, and that discrimination based on sex is still moving across the many different countries and denominations.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced that I am double and triple below.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: if I come to speak on skin color, racism, black women in the LGBTIQ community or black women from the Diaspora; if I mention in which way we have been abused physically, mentally and verbally, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">"" "but they all agree that women - all women - should come together to" "" "lift up their voices and sing" "" "Kumbaya, my Lord," "" "to achieve equality (some) of women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about that in addition to sexualised violence there is an institutionalized form of racist violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women from other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to as white girls due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black donors and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men in all skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, as a black woman, I can't join a movement in whose center the white woman stands, who refuses to consider injustices in her mind, which refers to both sex and the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my citizenship in a white-feminist sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women again and again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">In 1851, Sojourner complained in her speech: "am I not a woman?" and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman in a historic sense is a menial and marginalized being.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups, who also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropriation in order to advance their egocentric programme.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of blending skin color and gender, as some of them continue to keep silent on the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to teach them for the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded in order to give women of different origins a home and isolate themselves from white feminism, there is still the word "feminism" in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to get rid of feminism and join the movement of Womanism, which was launched for my dark skin and status as a woman, rather than advocating a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that black women define us according to our own ideas and set ourselves in the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, author of the book Africana possibly: claim (e.g.: Africa-Womanism: as we recapture ourselves) speaks of that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they can be completely safe and where the cultural, spiritual, psychological, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped, which constitute the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement that the black woman is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment, I can lift black women and women from other cultures, as in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and due to my being as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can thrive in an environment in which my life has neither passed, nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2484">When another woman presented Balbuena for abuse, Ada Báez's well-informed announcement was also of no use.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second wife returned to her display.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women complain at all, they generally do not receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women, who admit, are victims of violence, are at all reporting to the law enforcement authorities.</seg>

"there are several indications and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">The numbers available, however, are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the District Attorney Office received 9600 ads for domestic violence. 70% of them were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 adverts due to domestic violence in the courts of peace. here, too, 86% of the ads of women came here.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women said they were physically maltreated, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">"" "according to the Paraguayan Women's Minister Ana Baiardi only a few of these crimes are actually shown." "" "9 women who do not do this are reported to any woman in Paraguay for the treatment of psychological abuse." ""</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "" "" "there are two women who don't do this because of physical abuse," "" "she declared at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's suicide in Paraguay is not a criminal offence, law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies because of violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible abuse and a legal system that does not undermine anything</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called him the name of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">At the beginning she didn't want to do that, but then gave up. this was to repent for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos. but for two years she bore the psychological violence on his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognize:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought that I would once become a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that it only happens to women who are too subservient because they are deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on maltreatment by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had insulted her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had so long enjoyed Carlos and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who was not from Paraguay, fought with the authorities in Paraguay for almost eight years to prove that their former partner had been mistreating them.</seg>
<seg id="2517">"" "Victoria is a member of the" "" "Yo te Creo" "" "network (" "" "I believe you" "" ") made up of women who are all victims of abuse." ""</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victoria's case everything started with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her prosperous partner finally managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victoria's advertisements with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She led a trial against her former partner, who developed into an unpredictable legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country, in which it was mainly money, power and the influence of her former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguays laws: good approach, poor implementation</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016 a draft law was discussed at the Paraguayan parliament, which was known under the hashtag # PorEllas (# fordir).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the # NiUnaMinos movement (# Non-Less) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original bill of the law stipulates that Female is to declare a perpetual offence and to punish the hardest as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus, the legislative text has been altered in some ways in order to also win the deputies for the law that are afraid that the way for the decriminalisation of abortions is denied, which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and are punished with up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">"" "" "" "the original draft law foreseen most of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs that must bear the victims of violence currently, if they just want to reimburse and receive safe accommodation to impose the state." ""</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial means for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">A rethink must take place here so that violence is no longer perceived as normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Those who are silent in the face of these facts make themselves guilty and contribute to the fact that the perpetrators will be punished.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We have to refund for such a long time until maltreatment is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the Paraguayan Senate. however, parts of the law had been altered beforehand, including a passage that the partners called in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="2540">Opinions on the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to re-attack his victim.</seg>

<seg id="2547">More than a year ago, the Ottoman authorities closed the independent Arab-language newspaper Azamn for its reporting on corruption in the sultan.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, continues to be in prison where he is serving a one-year prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and brought to court, but later released.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been governed since 1970 by Sultan Qabus ibn Said who came to power after he had abused his father, Said ibn Taimur, by a coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only Sultan, he has held the most important positions in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Minister of Finance, Foreign Affairs, Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The Sultan's rule is characterised by the insistence of the security forces, especially domestic secrecy, civil liberties, including freedom of press, restricting and torture human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities systematically curtail peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and prevent citizens, including activists, to express their views on the country's public affairs, such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the newspaper Azamn, its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper in which since its inception in 2007 about corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy) has been reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On 28 July 2016, security forces Ibrahim Al-Maamari, editor-in-chief of Azamn, arrested an article published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 with the title "High-ranking parties bind hands of the judiciary."</seg>

<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fines in the amount of 3,000 Ottoman rial (7800 US dollars).</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars) after he was found guilty of using "an information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order."</seg>
<seg id="2569">For al-Abri, a refundable deposit of 5000 domanian rial (13,000 US dollars) was established and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2570">The Appeals Court acquitted Al-Abri during a hearing on 26 December 2016, but sentenced Al-Haj to six months in prison for a year and Al-Maamari.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 following his six-month prison sentence from the Central Prison in Maskat. al-Haj remains in prison where he served his prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Appeals Court also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper "Azamn."</seg>
<seg id="2573">In spite of the decision of the Court to allow Azamn again, the newspaper still faces attacks by the Ottoman government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January, the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closing of "Azamn" was extended by three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information personally signed another statement in which the closing of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months and with which the minister once again ordered the Appeals Court's decision to repress the publication of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The ongoing closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the paper are not the only cases where the press freedom was violated in Oman in recent times.</seg>
<seg id="2577">Further violations, for example, include the closure of the website of the independent journal Mowatin and exercising pressure on Albalad, the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the ongoing closure of Azamn and the imprisonment of journalist Al-Haj the impression arises that the omanic authorities are still unwilling to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (GCHR) calls on the Korean authorities to:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. to release Yousef Al-Haj immediately and unconditionally;</seg>
<seg id="2581">2. to create a secure environment for the newspaper Azamn, so that their journalists can follow their work;</seg>
<seg id="2582">3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and</seg>
<seg id="2583">4. in all circumstances, to ensure that human rights defenders and journalists in Oman have unhindered their legitimate human rights work and can exercise without fear of retaliation measures, including arbitration chicanes.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, figure takes place with his understanding</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site: on the one hand, there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more severe consequences in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for researching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research carried out by African scientists will help build up its own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Centre for Infectious Diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">In the 1990s, he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, when the AIDS epidemic was the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a post-doc at the University of Pennsylvania, he researched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the Sámi health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GM): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the Serbian national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">I also launch a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GM: what do you think are the important current scientific topics in your country and general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always stay receivers instead of being self-makers.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not very useful in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>

<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are promoted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GM: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Lab material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already an interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is a need for special academic training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, exploration of space, healthcare (non-transferable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GM: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa vis-à-vis Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: it is often the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here.</seg>

<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website of Ensia.com, a magazine about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been in the USA salad since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 sorts, such as Outrageous, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years Morton's work was limited only by his own ingenuity and the question of how many types of lettuce he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents applied not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties, such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or truncated leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain and carrot varieties. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts provide food security to the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton continues to breed lettuce, but it now needs longer because his work becomes more and more difficult due to more and more limitations.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is like a rock boulder in a river that I have to thread." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do it now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think that patents on salads are too far away." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before the court, no one can breed a new variety of salads, because all the features are already patented. "he is doing as good as possible and tries to breed the characteristics he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very cautious and tries to use no material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement growing in the U.S. and anywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">"" "astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Römersalat of the" "" "greenhouse" "" "of the station. there it is tested if plants can be grown in space." ""</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT sector and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for Open Source seed) is inspired by the movement for free "Open Source" software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, shortly Ossi, US breeders can commit themselves to being able to freely use the seed bred by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it. "open Source" breeders only allow others who purchase seed to breed it to breed their own varieties, and not immediately cut out - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeritus professor of University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over seed and the possibility to breed new plants is important both for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seed plays a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasizes that the "open source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed, the latest examples of the merging of ChemChina and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer that are offered in August and September 2016." whoever wants to buy good, locally and sustainably produced vegetables should also know that the way in which this vegetable is bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without a seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to keeping their seed freely available to others, as opposed to patenting seed and plant attributes.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always limited.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, worked in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found that about a third of all card attributes are protected as intellectual property, which makes it usable for plant breeders either at all or only difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, such estimates are not yet available, but experts such as Luby suggest that mass-grown plants such as wheat are patenting in even greater style than lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Viewing</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are grown in such a way that they have specifically desired characteristics - from those by which their taste or colour improves until such, because of which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing due to more and more patents. currently, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-spokesperson Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, it contradicts the view that intellectual property restricts other breeders as "patents and protection of plant varietal innovations promote innovation." a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection does not inhibit innovation, but promotes it by making more material and know-how available to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees it differently: wait 20 years until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to breed plants adapted to the modified environmental conditions, you would have already lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton, however, is that genetic resources have always been a common good and continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">"" "" "" "we want to facilitate farmers their work." ""</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it will make us impossible if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total, Morton is bothering with the concept of patenting plant characteristics: "we don't really create the features themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders, we have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "whoever breeds a variety, also breeds his own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation methods are needed herbicides, are bred into its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is just opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than for example Monsanto are) patents, most smaller seed companies can survive even without patents - either they reject patents or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photograph by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton also believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents: "it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patent.</seg>

<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, runs an "open-source" seed programme. to preserve the seed of traditional crops, the Centre cooperates with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the newest targets of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities are still blocking content on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of the 5th of August, the Egyptian government closed the site of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported about the above.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published a statement on Facebook, in which the Egyptian authorities strongly criticized and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights information remains - despite this attack and the extermination of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who are supposed to defend the law, to expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, so it was never as important as now. ANHRI confirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the blocking and not to impart. we insist on fulfilling our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored site of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arabic-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Qatar-based network of Al Jazeera for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Ägypten: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of webside barriers. @ anhri one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, there is no access to the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the dissemination of columns and articles he writes for in Egypt inaccessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">"" "" "" "now the blog which he set up to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government itself became the target of an attack." ""</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider with which is also home to Ziadas blog, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent almost 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, reporting about the student protests and taking a video as the police exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles mainly revolve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blocking blogs is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, so it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has been possible for them to give me the feeling of a state of siege; An arrest, an attempt to murder, summons to the National Security Council, the blocking blogs, as well as any other web site I worked for.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) They proved that I did not write for nothing. in other words, my words have influence, albeit only to a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post articles to bypass the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now after they have locked him and that they're afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave ones walk the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 6 August. this resulted in technical tests on networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), among others Orange, Vodafone and ETISALAT.</seg>
<seg id="2743">It also documented the blocking of suppliers through the circumvention of internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12th we noticed how the blocking of web pages that VPNs offer started.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice suggests the government's intention to continue to block and filter content that the Egyptian users could have access to.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is also worsened by the fact that the censorship decisions are taken behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis to act against these acts in court.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>
<seg id="2751">The Brazilian Army in the favelas in Niterói, a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro, during the government crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2752">Photo by: Estado Maior (CML) via photos públicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0</seg>
<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers in Brazil report with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot in school," "Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro," "Thieves robbing pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and air to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio achieved the highest level for 10 years in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable & # 8212, at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In this way, the newspaper "Extra," known for detailed reporting on violence in Rio, published the editorial "This is not normal," in which she announced to set up a new section called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The newspaper explains the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sex crimes, etc. whatever happens in the civilized standard, and what only happens in Rio, will be published in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that as journalists we do not close our eyes from cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes said that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war break in a country that does not recognise the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist from the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to disguise the atrocities of the police, which only imposes and then asks questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">"" "does the term" "" "war" "" "harm more than it benefits?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira, on the other hand, argues that violence as a "war" is arguing. this is, in her opinion, a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it harder to take responsibility for the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated by the analysis of military operations in Rio - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and complactional neglect of the public sector.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Reminder: the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2777">"" "according to Cecília, Rio de Janeiro is wrong:" "" "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and north-east of the country. these are the latest available data." ""</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "when we look at the murder rate per state, Rio is in place 16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">The company Globo, the largest media company in South America, has been in charge of the security policy of the state for many years, especially in South America's largest media company.</seg>
<seg id="2781">These security policy measures also included the foundation of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit imposed by the federal state of Rio in 2003, whose goal is to conquer a favela by deploying a massive police station and permanently stationing unity there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, however, this led to a decline in violent deaths. for some years now, the UPP, after several reports on harassment and repression against the poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit, is increasingly under fire.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux recited from one of his articles in 2010, explaining why violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria set by the Geneva Convention - the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also entails serious consequences for the people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This requires the state to use means and ways typical of a war. this involves entering into the territory of a "enemy," in which a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes the object for "collateral damage" and "lost balls."</seg>
<seg id="2787">The fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas continue to suffer in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">A week later, the police cleared the mountain with the favela Jacarzinho in order to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: an orchard died as a result of shots that had fired the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer under brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">In particular, the Eastern Ghouta region, where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21, 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition are assuming that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas have been under siege outside Damascus, which led to the fact that residents are dependent on locally produced or through tunnels and checkpoints.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teach the inhabitants of Eastern Ghoutas how they can plant their own fungi as a "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alchema and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Fungi do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria and are only extremely rare in the Syrian cuisine. however, their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The right of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we chose the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars."</seg>
<seg id="2813">Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organisers, reports Global Voices, that for three years now has been fighting to make this project known and expressed his relief that it is now more and more "gaining popularity."</seg>
<seg id="2814">To make money for the initiative, we use the humanitarian Crowdfunding platform CanDo in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alsacda.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to provide 125 families knowledge of the cultivation of fungi, according to Dr. Leila zu Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the Constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 €, but will continue to collect donations to CanDo until Monday, 04 September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the fuel shortage locally produced plastic fuels are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">"" "Dr. Leila told Global Voices that they began with" "" "production of mushroom seeds originating from the regions" "" "before they check their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption." ""</seg>
<seg id="2820">Then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub. as this succeeded, they used a larger tub. and so on.</seg>
<seg id="2821">"" "now they have designed a" "" "educational farm for the region" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months they have distributed fungi everywhere in Eastern Ghouta for free.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many districts of Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that were rampant in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government calling for a state of state last week in solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Brandies were also registered in the Galicia region of Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fire bursts spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June there was a similar tragedy in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest surveillance system, which monitors forest areas via satellite recordings, about 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal in 2017 alone - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>

<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees of easily inflammable wood, as in a vicious circle, spread further on fires of this species.</seg>
<seg id="2855">These problems add that the website of the Civil Protection of Portugal on October 15 and 16, when inhabitants sought information or attempted to contact relatives offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that supplied the population with information: it exploited their own civil protection data through the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of the fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so crucial at this fateful weekend in October that the servers didn't resist the onslaught of 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website counted more than half a million hits.</seg>

<seg id="2876">Even though his mother didn't say so at that time, she knew she would not see her son much longer - maybe even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">In the morning, the boy should break up.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tugs.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, leader of Hezb-e-Wahdat, dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara suddenly felt unprotected.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, came closer and closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Ashark found himself in Pakistan again.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was heavy and made him ill.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his low wage, and went to Iran. once again, he was in a foreign country with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortar, heavier than himself, to earn his livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time, as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterized by poverty and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"" "" "" "it was really hard," "" "Ashark recalled in an interview with Global Voices." "" "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site, on which we also worked." ""</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no service there and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we could not freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Ashark left his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing of the sea he suffered shipwreck and landed on a small, uninhabited island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his application for asylum, Ashark came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time was homeless, running alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid needy two times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that due to relatively high twin rates, Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers. it is true, however, that the conditions that asylum seekers find in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "the human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system" "" "suffers from a general lack of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000" "" "special reception centres" "". "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can be drawn up for months after the registration of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who do not have money for accommodation are either dependent on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it took Asharaf as well.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his inconspicuous will of life helped Asharper to get rid of these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After several years of working in the construction industry, Ashark put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that after a while, he opened a second hostel and a quick snack.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis's success story is now the subject of documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") of director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film won the Venice City Award in 2017, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates, around 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some Afghans have created companies, including tailor shops, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants have even been praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience where the waiters and kitchen personnel are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The restaurant's menu tells of the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their journey to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the Peace & amp restaurant in Padova and also behind the Kabulogna pizzeria in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Asharan's goals range far beyond the Italian restaurant industry and retail, and aim to return to the country that he had forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are opportunities," says Asharper with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I can't live happily when I know that my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">They represent half of society and have the same possibilities as everyone else. "</seg>
<seg id="2925">"" "Ashark also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques." "" "so they can sell their crop surpluses on the market and improve their financial situation," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development to the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end stability and prosperity are at the end.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Ashark has made this journey himself. now he wants to help other Afghans on this journey.</seg>
<seg id="2928">Netizen report: bill drafts from Egypt allow disconnection of social networks Mahmoud Abu Zaid, aka Shawkan, for more than 900 days in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2929">He reported on the clearing of the camp Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo, which protested against the displacement of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Photo by @ Ciluna27 on Twitter shared.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen report is an international snapshot that shows challenges, victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament has reviewed a draft law that foresees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users must register in order to be able to use social networks within six months of successful receipt of the law on the authority's website, stating their full name and ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who failed to take this step could be sentenced to a prison sentence of up to six months or the final settlement of a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was applied by sixty Members of Parliament, is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "may another MP filed a legislative proposal in which harsher penalties for the insult of the president or a senior official would be introduced." ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under Egyptian law, the insult of the President and government institutions is already punishable. however, under the law proposition, such action would be punished with prison and fines, according to legal experts at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is to be passed, this may mean three years "imprisonment for the convicted.</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would undermine a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian policemen while demonstrating violence against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the resignation of elected president Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">As more than 700 protesters who had been arrested in the same incident, Shawkan had four years in prison for a court appointment.</seg>
<seg id="2942">His trial was recently postponed to 20 May, because the prison management, according to human rights groups, failed to bring the accused from prison to the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan jeopardizes the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, including pseudo-ownership, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a Criminal Court held in Giza the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their reporting on the pro-Morsi sitting blockade on the Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The Court also reduced the sentences of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa, and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the previous incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activists to listen to passed documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, who is co-founder of Nawaat's independent media platform and the Global Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was interrogated by the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan, explicitly supports a controversial draft law that would guarantee business people and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on the website of Nawaat on 21 April throws light on how the presidential plans to support the bill of law look.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia declined the naming of his sources under Article 11 of the Tunisian Press Code, which authorizes journalists to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless he appeared in the district court in Tunis on 09th May as a witness in the case.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force users of social media to demonstrate their identity?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to new regulations of the information bureau of the People's Republic of China, users of social media in China require permission before they write or share messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">In the rules it is also stated that the registration with the full legal name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts assume that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks. until now, it is unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to only enforce these regulations in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Will we then see ourselves in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May, the state censorship of Russia closed the access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "according to Roskomnadzor, WeChat failed to register with the state government as" "" "organiser of information proliferation" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a law published in 2014, thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that organise the publication of the information. "the government also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing content and to compel them on request for the delivery of user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These websites currently include websites such as Vcontacts and Odnogorniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, the email service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court decrees block Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ordered the block Wikipedias in Turkey, after Wikipedia has refused to delete two English-language articles, the data that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">The Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communication admitted that the site was blocked because it was "an information source that collaborates with groups in order to create a political defamation campaign against Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time that Turkey has completely blocked the website. it is thus, among other things China, one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Great Britain cannot stop snuffling</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week leaked documents, the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communication in real time and install Backdoor programs that decrypt data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunications companies and intelligence agencies regarding the proposal but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation continues until May 19. reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
