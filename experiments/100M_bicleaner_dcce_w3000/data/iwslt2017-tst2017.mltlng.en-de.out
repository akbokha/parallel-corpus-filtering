that is James Ris@@ en .
perhaps you know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times repor@@ ter .
long before someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that the N@@ SA heard illeg@@ ally from Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a disa@@ strous US intelligence operation , in which the CIA gave Iran literally blu@@ epr@@ ints for a nuclear bomb .
if this sounds crazy , read it .
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but do you know whom the chapter did not like ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years , the government has been investigating cracks and called upon him to name his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and spy on journalists .
according to the First constitutional amend@@ ment , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the cour@@ a@@ geous ones they reveal .
so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many cour@@ a@@ geous repor@@ ters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the process , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although they stated for years that it would be essential to their case , the demands of the government were dropped to Ris@@ en .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the repor@@ ters and sources can hide less and less .
instead of separating and bringing tears to the testimony , that could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators worried , without his consent , his phone calls secretly ,
just like his email data , financial and bank information , his credit card , and even travel documents with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers and ris@@ ens alleged source .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised his accession to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary condemned him more than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result of whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional amend@@ ment , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as the government &apos;s technology allows users to circum@@ vent the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
they can do this from the moment they contact , rather than in hin@@ d@@ sight , in the witness stand .
today there are communication software , which has not yet been known as Ris@@ en wrote his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such a technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open source distribution system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now further developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work .
instead of sending an email , go to a news website like the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send information , as with any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government cannot obtain more information secretly , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset .
Secure@@ Drop is but a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies that thre@@ aten us all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to ensure that not only technology scientists like Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to conf@@ use mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the supply of soldiers and wants to report about over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental worker who al@@ erts the alarm to the contaminated water of F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall street in@@ sider who warns us of the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that rich and mighty &#93; have hidden &#91; enormous sums of money in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers are going to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up that ? &quot;
we actually see emails , sharing messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ ig@@ ned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad mail@@ box companies have tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is claimed that a track of $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend from childhood days , a famous cel@@ list .
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release , and on the next revealed documents .
now it sounds like the plot of a spy ri@@ ller or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems to we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all pay their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that applies to all of us .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
all over the world media and leaders discuss how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by a few to hide and obsc@@ ure their fortun@@ es -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens function .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these il@@ lic@@ it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I find it also interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the USA .
probably because there were no prominent Americans who were in these Dis@@ closure , this sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it &apos;s not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but by the principle behind which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens function , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer American customers .
if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US .
in fact , some US states need less information to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card .
this type of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
frau@@ d@@ sters have allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator called himself an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really shocked all of us to make suggestions on how to transfer his money to a lawyer from our investig@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was given money to anybody . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as individual cases .
it is not a single lawyer who submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
it &apos;s not about a single leading politi@@ cian , ent@@ angled in a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it may sound very sad as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist I see quite a few things to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years , we have seen suggestions for more transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU registers in central registers on a national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them .
one of the uncomfortable facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a draft bill in both parliament chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we would really like to see how these Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and global .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders who recognize the problem and use them to end this kind of in@@ transparency by law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together , we can finally end the in@@ transparency that now allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing .
this is the story I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
one day after I completed my design studies , I made a post@@ age sale .
there remained a type in the red Maz@@ da and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and made a road@@ trip through the whole country . after that he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him on a beer . he told me enthusias@@ tically how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what happened to me there ?
a stranger sleeps in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what if he is crazy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed , sh@@ ook the door to the door and closed my bedroom door .
but he wasn &apos;t crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the work of art he bought from me today hangs in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my perspective .
perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers in their childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
to house people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress with me .
let &apos;s take a leap , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate pul@@ ls out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can make it transform fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something for it . our apartment will be a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and breakfast each morning .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it great , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ettes ta@@ sted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them all over the city . when we said good@@ bye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I started .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came into the roll .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ ch@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if one could make a business concept from it .
so we presented to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people share publicly pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors are closed when visiting .
over the Internet , they can invite wild people to stay overnight with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were waiting for the mis@@ sile firing .
but they do not .
nobody who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ? why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you are contempl@@ ating the things that you can do well . we could design .
at the Academy of Art we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before .
can design make such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of what degree of trust we wanted .
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hands .
now I would like to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left sitting room@@ mate .
this silent flight of panic you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when opening the door for the first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they will see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
that &apos;s how most guests feel when they spend the night somewhere else .
only for this reason can our company exist .
just so , who is actually Al Gor@@ es mobile phone ?
could you please announce on Twitter that he is chann@@ eling for the president &apos;s office ?
you can return the cell phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up . I would like to tell you of some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail of this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first introduced himself to his name ; if he had told where he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you have 150 assessments that all say : &quot; he can really capture very well un@@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to give up your mobile phone ?
a well thought @-@ out feedback system will strengthen confidence .
in the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was hard for people to abandon negative jud@@ gements .
finally , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests left their assessments before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we have conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are in terms of age and place of residence .
we trust the people most that are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting when you add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by assessments .
if you have less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation suff@@ oc@@ ates common ground .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted love .
in addition , we learned that trust depends on how much you get from yourself .
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you say too little , like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you tell too much , for example , &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request will not be accepted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great works of art in your home ! I &apos;m on holiday with my family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can I create this degree of openness with design ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we didn &apos;t reck@@ on was the large amount of people who were more than willing to put down these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
first : unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a need not covered before .
for us , the business is running very well .
of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate parties or have demoli@@ shed flats .
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front line when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think about it .
the disappointment that one hears in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will always be our biggest motivation to further improve us .
fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million stayed nights had a problem .
for people were so familiar with each other .
if trust works , it can result in wonderful things .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect home for travelers who tend to be heart attacks because of sitting activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save one life even though they don &apos;t know one at all .
you drive a car in your own car when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books by .
they let one stay even longer without calculating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , not every stay exp@@ ires .
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this concept for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing coinci@@ de with monetary transactions ?
it is a question of economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but to call it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rental Industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not just the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people share a part of themselves , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , you can compare it with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic for that .
but what if traveling would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what if at any place you visited , a group of residents would wait to complete a thorough consec@@ ration and show you a quarter of a quarter of a quarter of which you have never heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments from scratch to sharing one another ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would assume the idea of sharing in common ?
I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
this project has already begun in South Korea &apos;s capital , Seoul . many parking places belonging to the Government ,
were now offered residents . students who were looking for a lead ,
were given to people whose children were ex@@ tin@@ ct . incu@@ b@@ ator programs were started ,
to be able to finance new start @-@ ups in Share Economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even host .
so the idea does not seem to be as crazy as we were taught .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
there was always hospitality in advance .
there were already similar sites in front of us .
so why has ours just worked ?
apart from luck and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find this amazing ,
overwhel@@ m@@ ingly overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da goes past me .
we know , of course , that design can &apos;t solve every problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use for design in the near future .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or oppressed , bra@@ in@@ washing , a terrorist ?
or just a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
that &apos;s how the media are people who look like me .
one study revealed that 80 % of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that Americans think most wouldn &apos;t know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double espresso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a car@@ rot @-@ fitness fan@@ atics ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not as Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I wasn &apos;t born that way .
I decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old , I made the decision to ou@@ ten myself .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to wear my hat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist friends were app@@ alled : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time , it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , in contrast to the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adjust to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents pas@@ sively .
I have strug@@ gl@@ ed with the Qur &apos;@@ an .
I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devotion that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;@@ an .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes makes me cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
have you ever had the feeling that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet somehow love ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I got married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that aw@@ ful morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Break@@ ing News &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew into buildings , people j@@ umped out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my shock quickly turned into rebellion .
why should I do something like that ?
I changed the TV channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; Near descent ... &quot; ... &quot; ji@@ had ... &quot; ... , &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
it has not only been attacked by my country , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others turned me into a suspect .
on the same day we had to go through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move into a new city and begin the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember , as I ro@@ de -- as we drove sil@@ ently -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was the first time afraid to be recognized as Muslims .
we moved this night into our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then , I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remain in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t ch@@ ase yourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings came : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims , or from people that were held for Muslims , drag@@ ged into the open air and beating .
there were really burns on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I got rid of the anger of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was angry also .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
I have nothing to ask , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today we can actually hear people say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and exclude mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the US body .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know that a malign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is false .
like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumour in the US body , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympic athletes .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
there might be a couple of parking spaces un@@ locked , but do not stop terror .
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to a more toler@@ ant approach to people of other fai@@ ths , and to show greater ci@@ vic participation .
and as I told me a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
during the radic@@ alization process , it has been established that it starts online . first , the person is cut off from their church , even from their family , so that the extrem@@ ist group believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who abh@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ it@@ or or rejected by faith .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we need to stop people going to the mos@@ que .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imag@@ inations if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , such as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; holy book &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if you look at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scriptures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that makes them read these things into the Scriptures .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she wanted to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was just the opposite . every priest with whom she spoke brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would have made sense of their rage , it was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised a solution .
this Ima@@ m re @-@ establishes the connection with God and their church .
instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an author@@ itarian system of governance , conformity and prejudi@@ ce .
a study shows that when test persons present news in which negative about Muslims was reported , they were more armed with military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you see when the mood of Muslims shot upwards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in advance of the Iraq war and during two electoral periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool for manipul@@ ating the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts all of us .
when as@@ signing collective guilt it is not only about having to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .
ah was an ath@@ lete .
he was at the faculty of denti@@ stry , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when has my brother become such a skilled young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her as well as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who was visiting in the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as in a execution after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot dead eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or did we stay safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , as it was about which America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us by fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion .
we chose the mos@@ que .
with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we drove sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took him out , took off my shoes , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw let me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assemblies were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had preferred the courage and compassion of panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or will you join those who say , &quot; We are better than those . &quot;
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who might say you &apos;re holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a think@@ ers with depth , working in a clas@@ h think tank , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t fool you . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as allowed .
looking at Muslims around the world , I did that with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want wealth for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so in no way I am an exception .
when humans appear as an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a billi@@ on@@ aire business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air @-@ packing penet@@ rated our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six @-@ meter high tower from 1 500 bricks in front of the audience . some years ago , they began to fly with ropes .
connecting flights achieve high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test of spaces .
they can also build autonom@@ ously load@@ able structures .
they have learned to bear burdens , deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of what is possible in an autonomous flight .
in order for a system to function autonom@@ ously , it must be collective to know where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available on the highest level e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called hed@@ ging starter ,
a flight device trying to beat two flies with a flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations .
in contrast to most of the star@@ ters , it can float , and therefore has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a restriction of stern @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight machine doesn &apos;t matter what position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often ask for basic abstract questions that are at the heart of the matter .
one such question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that accum@@ ulate to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots could fly remotely controlled aircraft that had only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flies work with only one .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ els , the mechanically easiest @-@ to @-@ operate aircraft . recently , it was invented .
it has only a movable part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ dder , no further actuators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechanical simple , very much happens inside the inner life so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in the room .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern @-@ star@@ ters . to get it to fly , I have to throw it exactly right .
the probability of just throwing it right when all of you watch is small , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the mon@@ osp@@ els is an exercise in car@@ el@@ essness , this machine is here , the bus with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is still symmet@@ rical .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
as a result , it receives the extraordinary ability ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter in which direction it is turned or even as it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers from the eight prop@@ ellers .
some things can be seen in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let &apos;s look at it .
when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate prop@@ ellers .
it turns clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
when building them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller comes out , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly even if it is restricted .
we will demonstrate this by making one half f@@ light@@ less .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we used commercially available micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations motiv@@ ate you to think of new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine over there would like to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology .
for types like us lies the wage in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creatures to shape it in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive industrial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed in a very far away gal@@ axy , so they turned the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second .
for this short moment , they sh@@ ined bri@@ ghter than all the stars in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not set their energy free in the form of light --
we finally talk of black holes .
the whole energy was released into the space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded into gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us classi@@ fy the events in time .
1.3 billion years ago , there was just a number of lives on Earth .
since then the Earth has brought forth quite a few things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God is standing at us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly cour@@ a@@ geous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver of the Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravit@@ ational waves , which originate through colli@@ ding black holes .
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy genius , so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea .
after decades of development , design , design and extremely hard work , they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ omet@@ er- and gravit@@ ational @-@ waves observ@@ atory .
in the following period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which improved the recognition performance tremend@@ ously .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to solve some minor , stub@@ born problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start of the detector , the gravit@@ ational @-@ waves ro@@ cked through the earth through the gravit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes .
they went through you and me
and through the detector too .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of My Dau@@ ghter
and the f@@ arewell to my death @-@ sick father .
basically these were the fruits of my life .
all that I had been working for is no longer science fiction ! AA : that &apos;s my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gravit@@ ational waves from black holes for 23 years and her by observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals .
a gravit@@ ational @-@ wave is a rup@@ ture in the structure of space and time .
when sur@@ passing the shaft , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and thrust into the other .
for illustration , lec@@ turers in courses on rel@@ ativity theory often lead to a really old dance .
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
the problem is that gravit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14th , for example , each of us was stretched and stu@@ ffed at the arrival of the waves . the el@@ on@@ gation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is 20 zer@@ os according to the comm@@ a followed by a 1 . that &apos;s why the Lig@@ o staff declared crazy .
with a five @-@ kilomet@@ re laser detector , and that is already absurd , this length would have to be measured to less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of an atomic nucle@@ us . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text about gravit@@ ation
Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves in the following manner : &quot; the technical difficulties in constructing these detectors are enormous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public , all obstacles will be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile phone .
this is quite practical , because so you can customize a picture or a map of things by taking the light coming from several points around you .
it &apos;s different with sounds .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you :
about the face of your child .
instead we listen to certain properties such as pitch and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now is Alice &apos;s speaking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts her . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s@@ wimm@@ ers Bob &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make easy pictures of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least , the measured frequencies lie in the audi@@ ble range for Lig@@ o .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe speak .
to listen to the gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes , which my colleague Scott has occupied for quite a long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just like : w@@ up@@ p !
if the two bodies turn very fast , one hears the same chir@@ p with an additional key change . this sounds like this : Yi@@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed in the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- A date that at least I will never forget -- Hear@@ d heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render sound &#93; No one knows what to hear , knows this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold sun mass , which rotate approximately as fast as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s think about what that means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , cir@@ cling a hundred times a second before they colli@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
therein lies the remaining importance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a whole new way to explore the universe , as it was never before possible .
on this path we can listen to the universe and hear the un@@ seen .
we cannot see much in all -- practically or in principle -- not .
a super @-@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ as .
they are very useful . we learned a lot about the universe .
but the exciting physical processes happen in the nucle@@ us that lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never pass through because these are op@@ a@@ que .
gravit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them , because the Big B@@ ang is covered by his own after@@ glow .
with the aid of gravit@@ ational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and most importantly , I am optim@@ istic that things exist in all things that we have never seen before , which we have never seen , and of whom we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt that we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this topic : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , as lig@@ o ob@@ serves , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies of pre@@ historic times . the black holes are , so to speak , the din@@ osau@@ rs for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different view of the events in space , on the gen@@ esis of the stars and ultimately on how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as cour@@ a@@ geous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o we know how to build magnificent detectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories - a brand new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
for what could be nic@@ er than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
do you dream with us ?
thank you .
some time ago I tried out an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; Yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I was afraid of , eliminated my fear .
my fear to keep talking , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my life changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply , to an unexpected kind . it began with a question of my smallest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my be@@ ak @-@ sau@@ cer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this Yes was the Beg@@ inning
a new attitude towards life in my family . from then on , I always chat with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family .
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently did I fully understand that the &quot; yes &quot; say to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I &apos;m a writer . I think things out , you &apos;re thinking about living .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I produce television .
I do TV , in great style .
in this TV season I am responsible for bringing about 70 hours of program to the world .
four TV programmes , 70 hours of television . three to four shows at the same time are in production .
each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode every nine days four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollar television , four TV programs , 70 hours of TV , three broad@@ casts simultaneously in production , four , 16 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of TV ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series are running consec@@ u@@ tively on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself and not only produced , so still top . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires burning around the world .
do you know who else does it ?
no one , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with this .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you , that all of you who work so hard , whether you now run a company , a country or a classroom , a shop or a household , take me seriously when I speak of work , so you understand that I &apos;m not just sitting around the computer and f@@ anci@@ er , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it &apos;s not about dre@@ aming with a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , everything reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I am deep@@ ened in my work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it is as if I set up troops when I painted on a canvas .
as if you were wearing a high tone , deliver a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love working .
she is creative , mechanical , ti@@ ring and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clinical and mother@@ ly , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing about it is the bu@@ zz .
there is such a change in me when the work goes well .
a bu@@ zz@@ ing starts in my head and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz@@ ing sounds like a busy road , I could go for it forever .
many people accept when I explain to them the sums that I am talking about writing that writing brings joy to me .
don &apos;t get me wrong , that &apos;s what they do .
but the sums -- when I started with television production , when I began to work and work and make , build , create and collaborate , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz , this energy . the bu@@ zz !
the bu@@ zz is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is the voice of God in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz then you cannot strive for great@@ ness .
the feeling of not being able to strive for size , no matter what price .
this is called the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is genius .
perhaps it is called ego .
perhaps it &apos;s the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I am not do@@ omed , and I only know that I love hum@@ ming .
I just want to tell you I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make it clear : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more blur@@ red borders , the more work there is , the more things I write , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high clay , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz .
I like this bu@@ zz . I love the sums .
I need the sum . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I just this bu@@ zz ?
and then the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , over@@ done , burnt out .
the tot@@ als stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their m@@ um is a single subject .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um won &apos;t be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are the children of a Tit@@ us .
they are baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t love my work anymore .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing did not come back .
my bu@@ zz@@ ing was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ day , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ate , a Titan sleeps not , does not give up , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no bu@@ zz .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show@@ y titanium ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz@@ ing and the bu@@ zz I was .
so what do you do when what you do , the work you love suddenly fade away ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ay , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you &apos;re doing it , you &apos;re doing it , you love what you &apos;re doing , being a teacher , being a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another one and that gives one the bu@@ zz when you know the bu@@ zz , if you already know the bu@@ zz when the bu@@ zz@@ ing stops , who &apos;s you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; southern state wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no when two things become clear to me :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chat@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she calls no more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tal@@ k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did that happen ?
I miss it when I &apos;m Titan and my bu@@ zz@@ ing bed , and here everything changes before my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about this .
we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read very dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of breathing , I can &apos;t do anything except to watch out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone - they no longer exist .
everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and moist kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl wants to let go into &quot; Die Ice Queen . &quot;
peace and simplicity are everywhere .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something inside me dis@@ solves .
a mental door enters and an energy boost comes in .
and that does not immediately , but it happens it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing slowly comes back .
no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the bu@@ zz , but a bu@@ zz .
and now I feel like I know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the bu@@ zz , the sum@@ m@@ ons , the titanium frame , that &apos;s just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself with the help of broad@@ casts and television hours and how functional my brain is , then I have forgotten what the real bu@@ zz is .
bu@@ zz@@ ing is not a force and it is not work @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz is dependent on love .
the bu@@ zz is the current that comes from the lust of life .
the real bu@@ zz is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real bu@@ zz@@ ing ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real sum is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words to me , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a rule so that I can free myself from all guilt as a work@@ ah@@ olic .
it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing doesn &apos;t lie to me as much as they work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to work at the workplace than at home .
this admission is painful , because what a person rather works than being at home ?
well , yes , I .
hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of it .
we are racing around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we do small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we cr@@ ush soap bubbles .
I feel mostly stiff , absent and confused .
I always use my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the tot@@ als of the universe are full of me .
I play and play until I ask : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can do it too ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you keep me nai@@ ve for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you &apos;re right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something else .
it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bug or cookie replaces me .
and when my teen @-@ daughter speaks with me for a whole 15 minutes , I am the mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , more does not need it .
everyone can spend 15 minutes a bit , even at a bad mo@@ ods day !
15 minutes a bit !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to go .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my ben@@ evol@@ ence , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is necessary to feel the bu@@ zz , to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and preserve it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;m leaving and I &apos;m winning . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes a piece , why not take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz@@ ing came back in my free time . the bu@@ zz@@ ing seems to return if I do not work .
working does not work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the sums , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my hum@@ ming now .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of life .
the hum@@ ming of love .
the bu@@ zz of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so thank@@ ful for that .
I &apos;m gu@@ essing that I &apos;m a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan who plays a trip to Jerusalem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes to less work and to play more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children are .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clearer is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the bu@@ zz . the land I create , the marathon I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high tone , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , dying , naked and new feeling of life in me is wide . less titanium -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this bu@@ zz , the more I know who I am .
I &apos;m a writer . I think things out , I &apos;m thinking you &apos;re living .
this is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a serious stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low self @-@ healing capability .
after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who is trying to improve the nerve functions through various surgical procedures .
they certainly have one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; one im@@ planted a electrode deep in the brain in order to influence the ne@@ ural circuits in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function is improved .
it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease that suffered from violent trem@@ ors and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ cure .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help , the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was Chief Physi@@ cian and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often provided patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
they have to imagine that in the brain of skull @-@ brain trauma the brain is weak and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
in order to save life , you have to reduce the cran@@ ial pressure .
to do this you sometimes have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to let cells grow from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to grow cells from a tissue piece is comparable to all small children who are taken out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the surroundings to thri@@ ve .
that is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François managed .
he saw that under his micro@@ scope .
that was a great surprise for us .
why ? why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
you may also know from biology lessons that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operating room .
we did another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they are very fast .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they spread slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our brain cancer cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the fet@@ us stage , they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay for us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so sure .
one thing is , however , clear -- of these cells we got our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove it .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ language range and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean @-@ François .
and then mark them in color to be able to follow them in the brain .
in the last step , we re @-@ planted them at the unloading point of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- car transplantation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we re @-@ transplan@@ t these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we have re @-@ planned the same cells in impaired brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario , we re @-@ planted the cells in a healthy brain and we observed that after a few weeks they completely disappeared as if they were removed again , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we had an injury to and re @-@ planted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained - they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we were able to observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been re @-@ planted .
the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells we dy@@ e in vitro , in culture .
of course we couldn &apos;t stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take pellets from a tray .
they made it very good .
when they reached a stable level of skill , we injured the motor skills range in the motor cor@@ tex .
ther@@ eu@@ pon the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand .
exactly as it would happen in humans , they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just like the monkey .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left you see the monkey that spontaneously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from the injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now see when we re @-@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the implantation .
I can tell you that were very exciting results for us too .
since that time we have found out much more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to implant it in humans .
I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely do .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before starting clinical trials on humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of study .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years will it take until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : it &apos;s hard to say .
initially , it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will the authorities allow us to start it soon ?
then it is necessary to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment .
then you have to apply it to a multi @-@ centric study .
you must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as imm@@ utable balances .
we believe capitalism will inevitably lead to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have undoubtedly proved that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth while politics remain completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy d@@ wind@@ les with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clear to me as Minister of Finance in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece .
at that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my rebel@@ li@@ ous friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be aboli@@ shed if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro Group are mistaken , we could save democracy , but that we need a genuine and defensive democracy .
for without democracy our societies are mas@@ ked , our future ble@@ w , and our great new technologies are wa@@ sted .
on the subject of waste I would like to point out an interesting contradiction which currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Twin To@@ o Par@@ ad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt that th@@ rows its long shadows over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the mountain of debt ,
but only a few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unused cash , which belongs to wealthy savers and corporations , but who are too anxi@@ ous to invest there where it would be productive and income with which one could wear the debt @-@ mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past three months , 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars have been invested in the United States , England and the euro@@ zone , in all the prosperity producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; $ 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds much money until you compare it with the $ 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion spending at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to infl@@ ate except the stock markets and boost the real estate prices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks , which are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand that , like in a continuous loop , encourages the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , who , by fear , the prophecy of the mis@@ sile might be true that his son would kill him if he will grow up ,
un@@ intentionally bring about the circumstances causing the body to kill him .
this is my Ha@@ des with Cap@@ ital@@ ism --
his extremely wast@@ eful art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth .
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy , of course , closed too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
but it would be a mistake to reduce the value of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these exclu@@ sions .
the decisive thing about the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it with@@ drew the working poor , and gave them not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which gave them the right to political co@@ determination with the same v@@ og@@ ue balance in questions of the state of affairs .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy hasn &apos;t lasted long --
like a candle that g@@ lows very brigh@@ tly , it is burnt out quickly too .
however , our today liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies did not have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a by@@ laws for rulers .
for the liberal democracy only arose when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was im@@ par@@ ted to politics , while the economy - that is , the world of corporations - became a more democratic zone .
in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economics began , an in@@ ex@@ orable struggle was taking place between the two , while the economy gradually under@@ min@@ ed politics and dis@@ ma@@ yed them .
do you wonder why politicians are no longer like they used to be ?
it is not a degeneration of their DNA .
it is because nowadays it is possible to be in the government and yet not in power , because the power is mig@@ rated from politics into the economy and the divisions are separate .
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of pre@@ dat@@ ors that so sustain@@ ably decim@@ ated the animals , of which it feeds on , that they star@@ ve at the end .
it is similar to the economy that has chann@@ eled politics into such a way that it hur@@ ts itself through the self @-@ created economic crisis . the power of the corporations grows , political goods are de@@ valued , the ine@@ quality rises , the overall economic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their businesses .
the more successful capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; from democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity .
if that is true , it is obvious that we need to bring the politics and economy back together , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; keeps control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the theory of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor reg@@ ain a position just as in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : to aboli@@ sh the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage labor through automation and robots .
the problem is that as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation can increase the twin peaks , increase waste , and the social conflicts are deeper , as it is -- very soon as I believe -- in countries like China .
so we must re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the re@@ united sector , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; seem like a documentary .
the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements it has emerged --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; Matrix , &quot; in which machines serve humans and humans put their energy into the study of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long talks the meaning of life .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
so what would it take , how could it look like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in the practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples .
in the field of companies : please imagine a capital market in which you earn money while you are working and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company .
then all income from capital comes from revenue and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no more distinction between those who belong to the company but who do not work in it , and employees who work there , which the company does not belong to . no more exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no to@@ wering twin peaks .
in the field of global political economy : please briefly imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of all mankind .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- call it &quot; the Cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or trading surplus of each country into a common fund .
imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John Ma@@ yn@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed at the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
today we have them , in particular against the background of a re @-@ united politics and economy .
the world I describe is at the same time liberal in which they fav@@ ored privileged persons , and Marxist , because they have buried the separation of capital and labor in the tr@@ ash of history , and Key@@ nesi@@ an , global Key@@ nesi@@ an .
but above all , it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide politically .
it is in our hands and we do it more democratic .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economics is ... Do we not do this , technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers describes as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we currently experience , it will not only destabili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant ,
as well as Hay@@ ek , therefore I am a liberal Marxist , and as Key@@ nes , and therefore I am completely un@@ fruitful .
BG : indeed , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t mind , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said this . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have clearly stated what you think of the West &apos;s view of China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I said in my talk , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most is playing -- the area of the economy -- is a totally democratic zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a certain sense , if I may say so pro@@ voc@@ atively , China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to link liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical about democratic development .
what can now be observed in China is similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China now pre@@ fers to do what the West did in the 19th century , sm@@ elling tremend@@ ously to hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I thought that comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later to the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to say good@@ bye to us , and the permanent den@@ ial that a massive over@@ throwing line ran out through the euro@@ zone and continues to be a massive threat to the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which by the way , was the first proposal that revealed this den@@ ial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the Euro Group , have continued to den@@ ounce the den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , you might be able to delay it for a while , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what change do you anticipate ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone does not have a future unless we change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Seri@@ ously ...
if there is a minister of finance , or any minister who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he has made no mistake , then that is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the financi@@ ers to find a common solution .
but that didn &apos;t exist .
they merely wanted to bring our government down , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that run through the euro@@ zone .
they did not want to admit that they had been implementing a disa@@ strous programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika , who imposed this policy on us , admitted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of the talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive .
for if they do not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it appears to me , it will also be unbe@@ ar@@ able to the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope you &apos;re wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being at TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
von Roy Price has never heard the most , although he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision that Roy hit three years ago .
Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has a hed@@ geho@@ g @-@ hair@@ style and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technique , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV shows that Roy can &apos;t select any one .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are on the right side of this bend .
this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this rating .
if your show is rated at nine and above , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive where after watching a season , your brain asks : &quot; where is there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve .
Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to sign &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the medium bul@@ let , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they just don &apos;t exc@@ ite .
so he has to make sure that he is really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is also the first time that Amazon is doing something so , that &apos;s why Roy Price does not want to risk anything .
he wants to create success .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where they can watch anyone for free .
and if Amazon is out of charge for free things , don &apos;t you intervene , right ?
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
however they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who are recording everything .
you determine when you start the show when you pause , which parts you skip over and look again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce with these data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process these and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above the average , but not exactly what Roy and his team were working towards .
about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design by Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find it a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different .
instead of organizing a contest , he and his team have looked at the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the ratings they give the shows , their course , what shows they like , etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the spectators : what shows they like , what producers , what actors .
when they had all the parts together , they entered a venture and decided not to have a sit@@ com with four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit with it , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 rating on that curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course , the question is : what has happened here ?
it has two very competitive , data @-@ diversi@@ fied companies .
they connect these many data to each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow says that it should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data , for a decision you make , you should make a good decision .
one has 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
the least what you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work so , then this is something frigh@@ tening because we live in a time when we reach more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anyone here know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room ever comes into contact with this software . come into contact , you are in prison .
if someone here is in jail and asks for release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not .
just like with Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is proof that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are produced . this is not because a company such as Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that by data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the bad type , could be predic@@ ated -- by data analysis of Google searches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it worked perfectly , year around year , until it suddenly stopped working ,
and nobody could say why .
it simply did not work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data stream into decisions of life - at work , in law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very wise men use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able lot of data to make serious decisions as the decision for cancer therapy
or the development of a medication . over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dis@@ semin@@ ated .
if you ever need to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
first de@@ compose this problem into its individual parts so that you can analyze the items ; as a second , put the items back together to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help dis@@ assemble a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to re @-@ assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to re @-@ assemble parts and pieces even if the information is incomplete , in order to get a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and intelligence where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , what else they would not have been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; does not stand in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first as they were competing for TV ideas when they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a secure decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what the data say to us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data is just a tool , and in order to not forget this , this device is quite useful .
thank you very much ...
before data was available , it was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also known as &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No @-@ question , you only have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will fight it out later with a technical demo .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , and I should have listened to the ball in hin@@ d@@ sight .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you want to replace them with something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so maybe the ball gets smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter . ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner .
and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions , be an expert in what you do , and take risks .
because in the end it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
