<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">Perhaps you know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA heard illegally from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a disastrous US intelligence operation, in which the CIA gave Iran literally blueprints for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If this sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know whom the chapter did not like?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government has been investigating cracks and called upon him to name his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern to condemn whistleblower and spy on journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First constitutional amendment, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous ones they reveal.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they stated for years that it would be essential to their case, the demands of the government were dropped to Risen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, the reporters and sources can hide less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of separating and bringing tears to the testimony, that could also do his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators worried, without his consent, his phone calls secretly,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his email data, financial and bank information, his credit card, and even travel documents with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistle-blowers and risens alleged source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised his accession to protect whistleblowers, but instead the judiciary condemned him more than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security has been the result of whistleblower went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional amendment, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as the government's technology allows users to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">They can do this from the moment they contact, rather than in hindsight, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there are communication software, which has not yet been known as Risen wrote his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such a technology is SecureDrop, an open source distribution system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is now further developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news website like the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, as with any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot obtain more information secretly, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is but a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spying technologies that threaten us all.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "it is important for us to ensure that not only technology scientists like Edward Snowden have an opportunity to confuse misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistle-blowers," ""</seg>
<seg id="39">Who knows about grievances in the supply of soldiers and wants to report about overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental worker who alerts the alarm to the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wall street insider who warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[the "Panama Papers" revealed that rich and mighty] have hidden [enormous sums of money in tax havens.] [what does this mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] this week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers are going to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up that?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see emails, sharing messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">"" "" "" "there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad mailbox companies have tax havens." ""</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a track of $2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, about a close friend from childhood days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others waiting nervously for the next release, and on the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of a spy riller or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to weep away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their fortunes in tax havens and not all pay their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that applies to all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">All over the world media and leaders discuss how secret tax havens are used by a few to hide and obscure their fortunes -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens function.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these illicit.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it also interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there were no prominent Americans who were in these Disclosure, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "now it's not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortunes in tax havens." ""</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle behind which these tax havens function, Mossack Fonseca has fewer American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, some US states need less information to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">Fraudsters have allowed scammers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator called himself an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "we really shocked all of us to make suggestions on how to transfer his money to a lawyer from our investigator." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody was given money to anybody. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not a single lawyer who submitted suggestions to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single leading politician, entangled in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">"" "" "" "it is about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability." ""</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we need to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">It may sound very sad as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing had ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist I see quite a few things to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "over the past few years, we have seen suggestions for more transparency regarding the owners of companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU registers in central registers on a national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the uncomfortable facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "" "" "representatives of both parties have introduced a draft bill in both parliament chambers, but this does not make the progress we would like to see." ""</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and global.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bogus companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say:" "" "intransparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leaders who recognize the problem and use them to end this kind of intransparency by law." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finally end the intransparency that now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I completed my design studies, I made a postage sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">There remained a type in the red Mazda and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and made a roadtrip through the whole country. after that he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he told me enthusiastically how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "as we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him," "" "Where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "and I thought," "" "Oh, man!" ""</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard:" "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "Ah, how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought, "Oh man! what happened to me there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">"" "what if he is crazy?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out of bed, shook the door to the door and closed my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he wasn't crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he bought from me today hangs in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my perspective.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers in their childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To house people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress with me.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost broke, my roommate pulls out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can make it transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could earn something for it. our apartment will be a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and breakfast each morning.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and created "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese-ham-omelettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them all over the city. when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I started.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into the roll.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blechczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if one could make a business concept from it.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented to the investors: "we want to create a website where people share publicly pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can invite wild people to stay overnight with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "that will be the next big thing!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="141">We were waiting for the missile firing.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why? why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you are contemplating the things that you can do well. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Art we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taste of what degree of trust we wanted.</seg>
<seg id="152">It's a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hands.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked mobile phone to your left sitting roommate.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent flight of panic you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when opening the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they will see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">That's how most guests feel when they spend the night somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who is actually Al Gores mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he is channeling for the president's office?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the cell phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up. I would like to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail of this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first introduced himself to his name; if he had told where he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you have 150 assessments that all say: "he can really capture very well unlocked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to give up your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">A well thought-out feedback system will strengthen confidence.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to abandon negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">Finally, we decided to wait until both hosts and guests left their assessments before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We have conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are in terms of age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">We trust the people most that are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting when you add a person's call -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three judgements, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation suffocates common ground.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted love.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust depends on how much you get from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you say too little, like" "" "Hi!" "", "you don't get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">If you tell too much, for example, "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the request will not be accepted.</seg>
<seg id="190">"" "so there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." "" "great works of art in your home! I'm on holiday with my family." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create this degree of openness with design?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we didn't reckon was the large amount of people who were more than willing to put down these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a need not covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us, the business is running very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate parties or have demolished flats.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked with customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front line when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hears in the voice of the caller was and will always be our biggest motivation to further improve us.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million stayed nights had a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people were so familiar with each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, it can result in wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"" "" "" "perfect home for travelers who tend to be heart attacks because of sitting activities." ""</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save one life even though they don't know one at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive a car in your own car when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books by.</seg>
<seg id="220">They let one stay even longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, not every stay expires.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this concept for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing coincide with monetary transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is a question of economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but to call it" "" "Rental Industry" "" "is not just the matter." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People share a part of themselves, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today, you can compare it with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic for that.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if traveling would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at any place you visited, a group of residents would wait to complete a thorough consecration and show you a quarter of a quarter of a quarter of which you have never heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from scratch to sharing one another?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would assume the idea of sharing in common?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">This project has already begun in South Korea's capital, Seoul. many parking places belonging to the Government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered residents. students who were looking for a lead,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were given to people whose children were extinct. incubator programs were started,</seg>
<seg id="242">To be able to finance new start-ups in Share Economy. over our platform alone, 785,000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea does not seem to be as crazy as we were taught.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There was always hospitality in advance.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar sites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has ours just worked?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find this amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Overwhelmingly overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda goes past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design can't solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use for design in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or oppressed, brainwashing, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or just a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">That's how the media are people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study revealed that 80% of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that Americans think most wouldn't know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A carrot-fitness fanatics,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not as Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I wasn't born that way.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I made the decision to outen myself.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as Muslims. I decided to wear my hat.</seg>

<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is false.</seg>
<seg id="327">Like all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumour in the US body, but a vital organ.</seg>

<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There might be a couple of parking spaces unlocked, but do not stop terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to a more tolerant approach to people of other faiths, and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as I told me a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">During the radicalization process, it has been established that it starts online. first, the person is cut off from their church, even from their family, so that the extremist group believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or rejected by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalisation, we need to stop people going to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imaginations if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>

<seg id="346">An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she wanted to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was just the opposite. every priest with whom she spoke brought her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that would have made sense of their rage, it was a major goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam re-establishes the connection with God and their church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways for real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how the Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian system of governance, conformity and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows that when test persons present news in which negative about Muslims was reported, they were more armed with military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you see when the mood of Muslims shot upwards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in advance of the Iraq war and during two electoral periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for manipulating the public to undermine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it first, but the toxic air of fear hurts all of us.</seg>
<seg id="368">When assigning collective guilt it is not only about having to explain itself.</seg>

<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew.</seg>

<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or did we stay safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, as it was about which America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us by fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the child's seat, we drove silently, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, took off my shoes, went into the prayer hall, and what I saw let me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the assemblies were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had preferred the courage and compassion of panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe on number?</seg>

<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is about to become a billionaire business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air-packing penetrated our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the Frac Centre in France built a six-meter high tower from 1 500 bricks in front of the audience. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">Connecting flights achieve high speed and acceleration in the tightest of spaces.</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build autonomously loadable structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to bear burdens, deal with turmoil and generally react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of what is possible in an autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to function autonomously, it must be collective to know where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at the ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available on the highest level e. g." "" "start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called hedging starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight device trying to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most of the starters, it can float, and therefore has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of stern-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence like wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight machine doesn't matter what position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask for basic abstract questions that are at the heart of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that accumulate to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots could fly remotely controlled aircraft that had only two moving parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flies work with only one.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospels, the mechanically easiest-to-operate aircraft. recently, it was invented.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only a movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and transverse rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanical simple, very much happens inside the inner life so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern-starters. to get it to fly, I have to throw it exactly right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability of just throwing it right when all of you watch is small, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monospels is an exercise in carelessness, this machine is here, the bus with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is still symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, it receives the extraordinary ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions, no matter in which direction it is turned or even as it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers from the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some things can be seen in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at it.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate propellers.</seg>
<seg id="453">It turns clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When building them together, they behave like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller comes out, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly even if it is restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this by making one half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We used commercially available micro-Quadcopter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations motivate you to think of new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine over there would like to be a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us lies the wage in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that it allows creative, smart creatures to shape it in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive industrial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled in a very far away galaxy, so they turned the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment, they shined brighter than all the stars in all galaxies of the universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not set their energy free in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally talk of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was released into the space-time structure itself and the universe exploded into gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us classify the events in time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago, there was just a number of lives on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the Earth has brought forth quite a few things: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God is standing at us -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of the Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which originate through colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy genius, so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, design and extremely hard work, they built the detector Ligo: the laser interferometer- and gravitational-waves observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following period, the precision of Ligo could be significantly increased, which improved the recognition performance tremendously.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to solve some minor, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the start of the detector, the gravitational-waves rocked through the earth through the gravitational-waves of the two colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector too.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of My Daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell to my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically these were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had been working for is no longer science fiction! AA: that's my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves from black holes for 23 years and her by observatories like Ligo measurable signals.</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational-wave is a rupture in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When surpassing the shaft, the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and thrust into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustration, lecturers in courses on relativity theory often lead to a really old dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14th, for example, each of us was stretched and stuffed at the arrival of the waves. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is 20 zeros according to the comma followed by a 1. that's why the Ligo staff declared crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre laser detector, and that is already absurd, this length would have to be measured to less than a thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves in the following manner: "the technical difficulties in constructing these detectors are enormous.</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public, all obstacles will be overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to say that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because so you can customize a picture or a map of things by taking the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">It's different with sounds.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain properties such as pitch and height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now is Alice's speaking." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "" "" "swimmers Bob" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make easy pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least, the measured frequencies lie in the audible range for Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe speak.</seg>
<seg id="522">To listen to the gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes, which my colleague Scott has occupied for quite a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, just like: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">If the two bodies turn very fast, one hears the same chirp with an additional key change. this sounds like this: Yiwu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- A date that at least I will never forget -- Heard heard the following: [Surrender sound] No one knows what to hear, knows this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold sun mass, which rotate approximately as fast as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think about what that means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circling a hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the remaining importance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a whole new way to explore the universe, as it was never before possible.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to the universe and hear the unseen.</seg>
<seg id="535">We cannot see much in all -- practically or in principle -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A super-nova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in Supernovas.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes happen in the nucleus that lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never pass through because these are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them, because the Big Bang is covered by his own afterglow.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the aid of gravitational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And most importantly, I am optimistic that things exist in all things that we have never seen before, which we have never seen, and of whom we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found things right in the first attempt that we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this topic: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, as ligo observes, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are, so to speak, the dinosaurs for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo gives us a completely different view of the events in space, on the genesis of the stars and ultimately on how we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo we know how to build magnificent detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories - a brand new generation of observatories on earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be nicer than listening to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Do you dream with us?</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried out an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for a year I would say" "" "Yes!" "" "I was afraid of." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced me to say "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what I was afraid of, eliminated my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear to keep talking, my social anxiety -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes," "" "my life changed." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"" "" "" "yes," "" "changed me." ""</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply, to an unexpected kind. it began with a question of my smallest.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" "" "kittens" "", "for inexplicable reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "kittens, I need milk for my beak-saucer." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the Beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude towards life in my family. from then on, I always chat with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I am doing, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I am very tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently did I fully understand that the "yes" say to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I'm a writer. I think things out, you're thinking about living.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I do TV, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for bringing about 70 hours of program to the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programmes, 70 hours of television. three to four shows at the same time are in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollar television, four TV programs, 70 hours of TV, three broadcasts simultaneously in production, four, 16 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of TV,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series are running consecutively on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts that I have created myself and not only produced, so still top. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who else does it?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you, that all of you who work so hard, whether you now run a company, a country or a classroom, a shop or a household, take me seriously when I speak of work, so you understand that I'm not just sitting around the computer and fancier, and it's true when I say: I understand that it's not about dreaming with a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, everything reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am deepened in my work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as if I set up troops when I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As if you were wearing a high tone, deliver a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">She is creative, mechanical, tiring and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinical and motherly, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing about it is the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work goes well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzzing starts in my head and it grows and grows, and the buzzing sounds like a busy road, I could go for it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people accept when I explain to them the sums that I am talking about writing that writing brings joy to me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't get me wrong, that's what they do.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- when I started with television production, when I began to work and work and make, build, create and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy. the buzz!</seg>
<seg id="618">The buzz is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is the voice of God in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz then you cannot strive for greatness.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being able to strive for size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it's the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I am not doomed, and I only know that I love humming.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make it clear: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more blurred borders, the more work there is, the more things I write, the more I write history, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I created, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high clay, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzz. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sum. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzzing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Overhauled, overloaded, overdone, burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The totals stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mum is a single subject.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mum won't be there, but you can write my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says:" "" "kittens, I want to go to Shonda-Land." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the children of a Titus.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the buzzing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzzing of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my work anymore.</seg>
<seg id="651">The buzzing did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzzing was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-day, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing delegate, a Titan sleeps not, does not give up, with whole heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzz.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a showy titanium,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzzing and the buzz I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do when what you do, the work you love suddenly fade away?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think," "" "Hay, stupid author-Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you're doing it, you're doing it, you love what you're doing, being a teacher, being a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another one and that gives one the buzz when you know the buzz, if you already know the buzz when the buzzing stops, who's you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern state waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I'm on the way out, late and she says," "" "Mom, do you like playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no when two things become clear to me:</seg>
<seg id="674">"" "first, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me" "" "chatting." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "she calls no more" "" "talkittens" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I'm Titan and my buzzing bed, and here everything changes before my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mom, do you like playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "and I say," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about this.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read very dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and panic, in loneliness and lack of breathing, I can't do anything except to watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country I created, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high tone - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists are sticky fingers and moist kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it is about letting go, or whatever the girl wants to let go into "Die Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Peace and simplicity are everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something inside me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door enters and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that does not immediately, but it happens it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzzing slowly comes back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, barely there, it's quiet, hardly audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzz, but a buzz.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The buzz, the summons, the titanium frame, that's just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself with the help of broadcasts and television hours and how functional my brain is, then I have forgotten what the real buzz is.</seg>
<seg id="707">Buzzing is not a force and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzz is the current that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real buzz is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real buzzing ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real sum is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words to me, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule so that I can free myself from all guilt as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing doesn't lie to me as much as they work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at the workplace than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what a person rather works than being at home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, yes, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">We are racing around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We do small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We crush soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always use my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the totals of the universe are full of me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can do it too! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you keep me naive for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You're right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes, until they think they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It's wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybug or cookie replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And when my teen-daughter speaks with me for a whole 15 minutes, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It is only 15 minutes, more does not need it.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can spend 15 minutes a bit, even at a bad moods day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a bit!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready to go.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my benevolence, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is necessary to feel the buzz, to have a place for peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "in order to" "" "play" "" "in general." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and preserve it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I'm leaving and I'm winning. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"" "" "" "want to play?" "" "is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training when I wanted to surpass myself more and more." ""</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a piece, why not take full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzzing came back in my free time. the buzzing seems to return if I do not work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the buzz, the buzz is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my humming now.</seg>
<seg id="775">The buzzing of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The humming of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The buzz of work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so thankful for that.</seg>

<seg id="779">"" "I said" "" "Yes to less work and to play more." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a serious stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low self-healing capability.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became a functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who is trying to improve the nerve functions through various surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">They certainly have one of the most well-known, the "deep brain stimulation." one implanted a electrode deep in the brain in order to influence the neural circuits in such a way that the neurological function is improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is truly an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease that suffered from violent tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation does not mean neuro-cure.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was Chief Physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often provided patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that in the brain of skull-brain trauma the brain is weak and the cranial pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save life, you have to reduce the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">To do this you sometimes have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To grow cells from a tissue piece is comparable to all small children who are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and the surroundings to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">That is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François managed.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why? why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">You may also know from biology lessons that stem cells are immature cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operating room.</seg>
<seg id="832">We did another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they are very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They spread slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">We saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our brain cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the fetus stage, they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay for us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is, however, clear -- of these cells we got our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove it.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non-language range and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them in color to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we re-planted them at the unloading point of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- car transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we re-transplant these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we have re-planned the same cells in impaired brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we re-planted the cells in a healthy brain and we observed that after a few weeks they completely disappeared as if they were removed again, they go back home. the space is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we had an injury to and re-planted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained - they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we were able to observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been re-planted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells we dye in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we couldn't stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable level of skill, we injured the motor skills range in the motor cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Thereupon the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand.</seg>
<seg id="870">Exactly as it would happen in humans, they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just like the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkey that spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from the injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see when we re-planted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the implantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were very exciting results for us too.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found out much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant it in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>

<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before starting clinical trials on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of study.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years will it take until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: it's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">Initially, it depends on the approval of the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authorities allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then it is necessary to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as immutable balances.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism will inevitably lead to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing have undoubtedly proved that it is quite possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth while politics remain completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy dwindles with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocally clear to me as Minister of Finance in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my rebellious friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Euro Group are mistaken, we could save democracy, but that we need a genuine and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy our societies are masked, our future blew, and our great new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste I would like to point out an interesting contradiction which currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "Twin Too Paradox" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt that throws its long shadows over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which belongs to wealthy savers and corporations, but who are too anxious to invest there where it would be productive and income with which one could wear the debt-mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past three months, 3.4 trillion US dollars have been invested in the United States, England and the eurozone, in all the prosperity producing goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">"" "" "" "$3.4 trillion" "" "sounds much money until you compare it with the $5.1 trillion spending at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing to inflate except the stock markets and boost the real estate prices." ""</seg>
<seg id="923">Debt and unproductive capital form the twin peaks, which are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe are unemployed, and consequently a low overall economic demand that, like in a continuous loop, encourages the pessimism of investors, who, by fear, the prophecy of the missile might be true that his son would kill him if he will grow up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally bring about the circumstances causing the body to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my Hades with Capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His extremely wasteful art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy, of course, closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">But it would be a mistake to reduce the value of the Athenian democracy due to these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive thing about the Athenian democracy was and is that it withdrew the working poor, and gave them not only the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which gave them the right to political codetermination with the same vogue balance in questions of the state of affairs.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy hasn't lasted long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that glows very brightly, it is burnt out quickly too.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our today liberal democracies did not have their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a bylaws for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy only arose when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was imparted to politics, while the economy - that is, the world of corporations - became a more democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In today's democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economics began, an inexorable struggle was taking place between the two, while the economy gradually undermined politics and dismayed them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer like they used to be?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because nowadays it is possible to be in the government and yet not in power, because the power is migrated from politics into the economy and the divisions are separate.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of predators that so sustainably decimated the animals, of which it feeds on, that they starve at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">It is similar to the economy that has channeled politics into such a way that it hurts itself through the self-created economic crisis. the power of the corporations grows, political goods are devalued, the inequality rises, the overall economic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their businesses.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism distributes the "demos" from democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we need to bring the politics and economy back together, and it would be better if the "demos" keeps control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The theory of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor regain a position just as in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage labor through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is that as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation can increase the twin peaks, increase waste, and the social conflicts are deeper, as it is -- very soon as I believe -- in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we must reunite the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we are democratizing the reunited sector, otherwise we end up in a pathological monitoring hyperautocracy, which makes the film "Matrix" seem like a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is, therefore, not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements it has emerged --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the "Matrix," in which machines serve humans and humans put their energy into the study of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," in long talks the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it take, how could it look like to have this "Star Trek" utopia instead of the "Matrix" like dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In the practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies: please imagine a capital market in which you earn money while you are working and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital comes from revenue and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No more distinction between those who belong to the company but who do not work in it, and employees who work there, which the company does not belong to. no more exchange between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no towering twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy: please briefly imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interests of all mankind.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- call it "the Cosmos," in units of "cosmos" -- and each government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or trading surplus of each country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund invests in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed at the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have them, in particular against the background of a re-united politics and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe is at the same time liberal in which they favored privileged persons, and Marxist, because they have buried the separation of capital and labor in the trash of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or will we sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it more democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography as libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economics is... Do we not do this, technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers describes as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we currently experience, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, then Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">As well as Hayek, therefore I am a liberal Marxist, and as Keynes, and therefore I am completely unfruitful.</seg>

<seg id="1038">Von Roy Price has never heard the most, although he is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy hit three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has a hedgehog-hairstyle and describes himself on Twitter as "films, TV, technique, tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy can't select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are on the right side of this bend.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated at nine and above, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addictive where after watching a season, your brain asks: "where is there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left side, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to sign "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the medium bullet, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they just don't excite.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he has to make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is also the first time that Amazon is doing something so, that's why Roy Price does not want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online, where they can watch anyone for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon is out of charge for free things, don't you intervene, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who are recording everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You determine when you start the show when you pause, which parts you skip over and look again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce with these data.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process these and this results in the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a sitcom over four Republican US senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "Alpha House" "", "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above the average, but not exactly what Roy and his team were working towards.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design by Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find it a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a bit different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of organizing a contest, he and his team have looked at the existing data on the Netflix audience, so the ratings they give the shows, their course, what shows they like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the spectators: what shows they like, what producers, what actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they entered a venture and decided not to have a sitcom with four senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit with it, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 rating on that curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what has happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">It has two very competitive, data-diversified companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data to each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow says that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data, for a decision you make, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">One has 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least what you can expect is good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work so, then this is something frightening because we live in a time when we reach more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone here know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room ever comes into contact with this software. come into contact, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone here is in jail and asks for release, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like with Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is proof that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are produced. this is not because a company such as Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that by data analysis outbreaks of flu, the bad type, could be predicated -- by data analysis of Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">"" "it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the" "" "Nature" "" "magazine." ""</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked perfectly, year around year, until it suddenly stopped working,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data stream into decisions of life - at work, in law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very wise men use unimaginable lot of data to make serious decisions as the decision for cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medication. over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you ever need to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First decompose this problem into its individual parts so that you can analyze the items; as a second, put the items back together to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help disassemble a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to re-assemble the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to re-assemble parts and pieces even if the information is incomplete, in order to get a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and intelligence where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, what else they would not have been able to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like "House of Cards" does not stand in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first as they were competing for TV ideas when they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a secure decision because they could always say:" "" "that's what the data say to us." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data is just a tool, and in order to not forget this, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Thank you very much...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before data was available, it was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also known as "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No-question, you only have to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will fight it out later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have made some decisions in my life, and I should have listened to the ball in hindsight.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you want to replace them with something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball gets smarter and smarter and smarter. ultimately, it's up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions, be an expert in what you do, and take risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
