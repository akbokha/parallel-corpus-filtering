Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view of the city
an Irish institution , where young people meet today .
a pit chapel , where it is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gar@@ den@@ ers cultivate the erst@@ while cause of peasants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
it is annoying if maps are not up to date .
everybody knows who had to get upset before , because the car navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bavaria of the state government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but therefore very revealing .
especially if you compare them with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how towns and communities have changed since the 19th century in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Mer@@ cury .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a Fli@@ ck@@ ent@@ ep@@ p@@ ich , which one does not recognize as such .
in the large picture postcard , more detailed maps , so @-@ called prim@@ eval sheets , were incorporated into cities and municipalities .
these were created according to the Bay@@ er@@ isches distor@@ tions administration between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first surve@@ ying of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even though the French troops were finally drag@@ ged down with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on 9 February 18@@ 01 : it was the present @-@ day neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map .
Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph further drove the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ograph@@ ische Bureau , &quot; and thus the Bavarian surve@@ ying government .
the composition sheet for Munich dates from the year 18@@ 56 and is to be found like all others on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison between early / today is most impressive in the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the 18@@ 56 map .
Send@@ ling was incorporated in the Munich subur@@ b 21 years after the map was created .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the current Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming in , a small @-@ scale map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand@@ written numbered plots from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ absorbing &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots do not occupy more farmers today - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , which has been the scene of the Oktober@@ fest since 18@@ 10 , was in the 19th century a meadow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the area of the current district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , in the area of the current district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , it is not only the street name &quot; at the Gast@@ eig &quot; or &quot; On the Air &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once locked people with ins@@ anity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich District Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard of Gu@@ dden pres@@ ided over the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended up using the so @-@ called Irish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he prohibited the personnel to use force against the in@@ mates , &quot; said Hermann Wilhelm , head of the museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients there was first place , later expanded to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the rot@@ ors in 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts since 2006 , has been located there since 2006 .
on the site of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt , young people meet in Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with educational establishments .
the football field of the TS@@ V München East is located to the west , east residential buildings from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was built in architectural reference to the original building of the Ir@@ ren institution , which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 56 and the Kauf@@ inger@@ strasse was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the bom@@ b@@ ings of the Al@@ lies tore many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a big remains to this day - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
the English institute , small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages were once stood at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line @-@ line takes place .
with the sli@@ der you can compare the old Munich @-@ map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at Mari@@ en@@ hof .
Om@@ bud@@ s@@ man publishes Travel War@@ ning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of Far@@ es issued a warning for coloured people who are travelling to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , ur@@ ges A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American travellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i to get special attention when travelling through the state and caution must be noted , as a number of question@@ able , ra@@ cial incidents occur in the entire state and are noted here , &quot; said the Group &apos;s opinion .
a recently adopted Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which makes it harder for people to win discrimination , as well as the state prosec@@ uting authorities that are dispro@@ portion@@ ately aimed at minorities , encouraged the group to release the warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they will be stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such frequency that we have not heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States .
the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist crimes against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the trip through the state and was put into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i Police , without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i General Prosecutor &apos;s Office in which black mot@@ orists in the state will be hal@@ ted 75 percent more frequently than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be ready to bring ch@@ ew money or know relatives that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i reported in 2015 100 hate crimes , according to the latest figures from the FB@@ I &apos;s hate crime report program , which classi@@ fies the state in relation to the number of such violations to the 16th ranking of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it harder to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the states adopted immigration laws , obli@@ ging local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations , which , according to the AC@@ L@@ U , will contribute to further ra@@ cial recognition .
travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but recently , stakeholders have used the measure as response to specific laws and trends within the United States .
soft aun@@ ching project is spontaneous
the Fisch@@ bacher Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ n project is a successful project and will continue next year .
the CD@@ U Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac provided an image on the spot .
at the legal tr@@ ench@@ y@@ hof of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the Fischer@@ bacher CD@@ U resort met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first granted insights into his farm , where he farms 55 hectares of law@@ ns and 40 hectares of forest , provides 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and houses holiday guests in five apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative free marketing path for the milk of his cows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only regi@@ on@@ ales arrive at the table of the holiday guests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as he is also the chairman of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ L@@ H@@ V &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he described the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spontaneous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t generate profit@@ ably on such steep faces .
the green area is responsible for a lot of work , a lot must be worked on with the brus@@ h@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the farm and managed it without any chemical plant protection and fertili@@ ser , even if it does not lead to bio@@ activity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognised the importance of the soft @-@ fence project and is happy about the leader @-@ promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers would have to be supported at a cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare .
it is hoped that the re@@ for@@ estation of the land could be pulled out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and thinking about how they will continue their operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the subsidies , farmers are often critic@@ ised
a total of 25 plots were fenced off by eleven participants in 2013 .
the maintenance area is thus 40 hectares , which must not be for@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half was promoted by leader , a quarter bore the municipality of Fisch@@ bach .
thus the farmers remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of soft @-@ fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ gevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and rural women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Peter Weiß also said : &quot; the best food products are produced here . &quot;
the Land@@ scape Conservation Line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg permits the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art promotion of soft f@@ ences .
the aim is to open the Black Forest .
the pre @-@ requ@@ isite is the existence of a sponsor@@ ship marked by the L@@ PR .
in addition , the area to be enclosed must not be sli@@ pper@@ y ( slope above 35 per cent ) and must therefore be threatened by re@@ for@@ estation .
the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build a fence of just 16 kilometres , is currently underway for the Fis@@ her@@ berg Wei@@ onn@@ ade project in 2018 .
the maintenance area is equivalent to 35 hectares , while the calculated costs are more than EUR 112 billion .
is nothing sacred ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans estimate this as well as any other - therefore the most carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ do square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump @-@ Regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated quar@@ rel with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N about the president &apos;s proposals for dr@@ astic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty .
to be fair , Miller didn &apos;t handle the statue himself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty im@@ it@@ ators would have liked him if he had done it .
but it took on its meaning , and in particular the importance that it was attributed to , when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta appe@@ aled , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem you refer to is added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is fac@@ tually correct , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary resonance of the stirring words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , / your oppressed masses , who long to breathe freely , / the el@@ lowing waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mis@@ erable apost@@ asy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better to see on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict , because of the significance of a statue , is part of a broader political and cultural conflict : it is indeed a conflict about America &apos;s significance .
Lazarus - and their friends , who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they had made a highly political action .
the sculpture was to show the connections between French and American republi@@ can@@ ism by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical depic@@ tion .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , the people of the right wing wanted to change this for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone but rather an early neo @-@ conserv@@ atives that bring the American flame to the converted world : &quot; Lady Liberty is progres@@ sing .
it is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not ligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
quite unusual , Lim@@ bau@@ gh was encountered here .
the importance of the statue is entirely a question of the viewpoint of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see her as seen by the exhausted , mis@@ erable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the deck of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they must hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever want to acknowledge .
their torch should not ligh@@ ten the way , but ign@@ ite the hatred that is their only source of power .
world Cup 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the UK &apos;s team
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Director General of the United Kingdom Ath@@ le@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the World Cup will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make a massive contribution to the team &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which ki@@ cks off on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something special develops in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the UK have to learn something out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type at the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chers , who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her talk was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought in quite naturally were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , competing in the fifth world champi@@ onships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 fle@@ ets are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total of athletes at the World Cup was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mu@@ ir &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mid @-@ distance runner will guide five British and two European records last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will take part at the 1.500 m and the 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man , which one should observe after a great season , which included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world champi@@ onships when the only other Scot@@ s@@ man in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell was .
the team captain says that they are &quot; very proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases they are also involved in med@@ als and fin@@ als .
&quot; the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team mates have voted for me and chose me , makes it really special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots belonging to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows just how far we have come .
and they are here as well established athletes , athletes who want to climb to po@@ di@@ ums .
what concerns my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think it went well .
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
block critics on Facebook : don &apos;t whi@@ p around a public office if you can &apos;t tolerate the heating of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the papers struck him because of everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he dab@@ bled in the cri@@ tique , certainly .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who has to work on being more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and that is why the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him at the beginning of this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state which is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest agreement of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary heat head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict observ@@ ance of the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means of connecting with his voters and playing his hair@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore the blocking of persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum that is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans spokes@@ woman Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the Gover@@ nor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it &apos;s too easy to use the image of tro@@ lls or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who swing the whi@@ p online .
the post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a pastor , no tro@@ lls .
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ ane .
the priest rec@@ ited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I pol@@ itely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the comments section of the news broadcast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same subject , then they are regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the governor referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam @-@ attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call others &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook Er@@ a makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or del@@ eting a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in former times when one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical cor@@ als or to arrest and silence prot@@ esters .
but it just happens digitally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official to critici@@ ze Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is acc@@ using by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones on this question fell last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County last viol@@ ated the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they ban@@ ished a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of the affordable port had a similar effect as the internet .
the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letter pen struck him on his leadership .
and even then Washington had anonymous Tro@@ lls .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions , which critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain , over@@ came his office , according to the historical documents collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project .
but he has not sil@@ enced them .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comfort over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an organizes the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who held links up to the final round in Arch@@ er@@ field last year before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from his best side , he is in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry made a great job when he laid down this place .
he is a keen advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engli@@ sh@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending champi@@ onships for the first time , although he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that really feels special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open as it was taken out of the program in the year after I had won it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from last year are coming back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European senior tour earlier this year after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to the action on his home base .
this event will be his first Scottish show since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a bit more if you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad that it has gone so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer by passive smoking
in the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died because of the passive smoking of lung cancer .
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer cases are attributable to passive smoking per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this issue in 1994 .
back then there were 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking per year in Germany .
the new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .
domestic connections turn out to be very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; the construction works in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vill@@ inger Straße &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are in full swing and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lie somewhat in time &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the manager of the building Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than expected , as a lot of mountains are hidden underground , which is not noted in the plans .
traffic , which always obstruc@@ ts the construction work , represents a major problem for the construction site of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of mot@@ orists in front of red lights and barriers is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are allowed to pass through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days have been exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;

poverty and death in the Indonesian gold country
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cooked dinner , she does not use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent in the un@@ peaceful Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace .
after half an hour , the char@@ coal tu@@ ber is removed and swal@@ lowed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay soil - it has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. clothes with mur@@ ky water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a hom@@ eless space serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her fields were assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , late to work can be dangerous : most of the village men are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; no one dar@@ es to run around in the village after 5@@ pm , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote before the occup@@ ying forces .
an existing movement , which stir@@ red up independence from the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers .
in 2003 , the province was officially parti@@ tioned into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea that included the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the rental car .
there is no public transport .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences and corrugated sheets that have been transformed by rust into different yellow @-@ brown tones .
only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreig@@ ner .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans honored a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we weren &apos;t used to wear these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand@@ woven Tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her light skirt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and have some of the worst inf@@ ant mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has min@@ ed in the value of $ 3.1 billion gold and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has a value of estimated US $ 78 billion on wood resources .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua , which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military keeps a sti@@ fl@@ ing presence .
an inquiry from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid local military personnel and units nearly $ 20 million between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 15@@ 0,000 in a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped , tor@@ tured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969 .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ ua &apos;s tribal high@@ land in the 1970 &quot; s were committed in accordance with the Human Rights Commission for genocide .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Will Every@@ thing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a report of the Bris@@ ban@@ e Arch@@ dioc@@ ese from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric sho@@ cks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal defeat of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since incidents occur every week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the bolts increased because Pap@@ ua &apos;s resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic developments are changing as Muslim economies come from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese waiting cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people fight to catch up here .
&quot; migrants have begun to sell chi@@ ckens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai natives who moved to the province capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the native Pap@@ ua , the Mama Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua , cost her market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indonesian President , J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , known as the Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised during his election campaign to address ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Pap@@ ua .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the total of 29 districts of Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Pres@@ idential Palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua , little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after his inauguration in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke on a motorcycle through the darkness .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took off their tone and later came back with four soldiers , according to the local pastor Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers , who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fires in the group of children .
a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ tis Y@@ eim@@ o , was so hard hit that he fell into a coma .
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered at a soccer field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice .
they wore cerem@@ onial hunting bows and introduced the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance - running in the circle and im@@ i@@ ti@@ sing a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began to hur@@ l stones at police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , a command was sent to the soldiers through an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it says in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released by local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the im@@ pending danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
no one was in the mood to listen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the ver@@ and@@ ah of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ ame still does not know who fired , but says that the bul@@ let came out of the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he adds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ did was hit three times , according to his cous@@ in , who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who , like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , only bears a name , the TI@@ ME in a glo@@ omy atmosphere . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief inspec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , told repor@@ ters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more were injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings came only on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks Jok@@ ow@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical ab@@ norm@@ alities in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2016 , Minister of Defence Wi@@ ran@@ to said that he set up an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historical violations of human rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries occurred long ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and early 2000 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that have to go through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke with TI@@ ME on June 5 , and said he had no plans to set up a complaint in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is regulated by law &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wi@@ ran@@ to , who called the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence elections in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Pap@@ ua have already been included , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with gri@@ m dis@@ belief .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress whatsoever , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that years later he still lives in fear .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid of being arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military searched for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police shot on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year old ra@@ viol@@ inist Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited village residents prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began shooting on the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u Ba@@ di@@ i who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the wounded have been delivered quickly , so TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have hidden myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called on to hold the involved officers accoun@@ table and withdraw the police &apos;s mobile bri@@ g@@ ade from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a hr@@ asing for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the tribal members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by spur@@ ring spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ den Kog@@ o@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily det@@ ained in custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; ensuring national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; among the people of Pap@@ ua Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens dis@@ content .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as far out of range .
the people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women , each of which can handle four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they keep the bulk of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a only cost 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the hub of Nab@@ ire airport .
the few jobs that exist in the region are generally aimed at the better educated and well @-@ educated migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to lead their own companies competitive .
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Go@@ bai , Chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai tribe .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported because of a lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , despite the rare permission to film .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , Human Rights Watch &apos;s deputy head of Asia , the promises made by Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s election campaign were not realised by the limitations of reporting to promote transparency and development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new threats to foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ easy eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua : visa refusal and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six Pacific States - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called upon the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically been supported by the O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there are free media , making it difficult to cover the evidence for human rights cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people on the spot want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the human right ambassador , K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on 4 May , local people broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has a further presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua says that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Go@@ bai , Chairman of the tribal treas@@ on .
he wants Jok@@ ow@@ i to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from being under the constant threat of a rob@@ ber military , is in poor educational and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he needs to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the threats and intim@@ id@@ ations , the families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ shot victims led a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of a victim was buried in an area just opposite the police and the military station .
they know they may never come to justice , but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire was found on Friday in one of Dubai &apos;s highest residential towers in Dubai , forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 @-@ metre @-@ high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that is swe@@ pt through the high @-@ rise in only two years , which one calls accidentally the Tor@@ ch Tower ( torch tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and when the people scre@@ amed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; a resident told his name as George An@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Du@@ ba@@ is civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units around 4.@@ 00 local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) extingu@@ ished the fire and cooled down the building .
the government said they work on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve issues relating to the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world .
an investigation by the management of the gate building after the fire in 2015 yiel@@ ded that the biggest part of the damage from facing , exterior cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation came .
in Britain , the police said that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding on the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup Reform : more Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the international tennis association ( IT@@ F ) has failed due to his great Davis Cup coup at the General Meeting of Shar@@ eholders .
at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single was not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority for this sport revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single one .
the often very long but also very cher@@ ished five @-@ sentence classics are thus preserved to the traditional competition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 % of member countries voted for reform , the aim of IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore scar@@ c@@ ely missed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations did not accept the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the application .
after many in@@ consist@@ encies , it was not until the vote that the proposal had already come before the finale at a neutral place .
new from 2018 are comparatively minor details : in the next round , the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right in the next round in the next round .
in order to reduce the costs of the Organ@@ izer , the requirements in terms of training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to do less official media dates before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring prohibited items into the aircraft , find out a survey
a survey conducted among passengers showed that more than 20 percent of intentionally or un@@ consciously prohibited items were s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed by the U.S. Transportation Security Administration &apos;s control points , including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft as they accidentally bore prohibited knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 per cent claimed they had been late discovered that they were mistakenly associated with guns , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey conducted at more than 1,000 people , which was carried out by a jet charter service , Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers would rather ignore the rules .
of the respon@@ dents who admitted that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something prohibited by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent of mill@@ enni@@ als were compared to less than 15 percent , who were members of Generation X .
the most common items intentionally passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 per cent said to have know@@ ingly carried subjects with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had intentionally brought illegal drugs into the aircraft .
the company said it was asking travelers throughout the country to find out how many in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed goods had been brought to the airport security and how many people had pur@@ pos@@ ely done it .
it is no surprise that people who are most likely s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - wear through security , those who fly most often .
the company points out , however , that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which fluids you are allowed to take with you or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids conf@@ is@@ cated by T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
for a while people thought that T@@ SA could look at books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers .
liquids are permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to talk to the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , he has hitherto under@@ scored that a part of the customer has already withdrawn its non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the always trium@@ phant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la @-@ CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k first revealed another , less brilliant figure for the announcement of the latest quar@@ terly balance : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k has often adverti@@ sed more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car whose ex@@ tradition has just begun .
now Mus@@ k ad@@ mits : from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 6@@ 3.000 have already been withdrawn .
critics have always pointed out that they are merely non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la will pay the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1,000 and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reservation payment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently 45@@ ,000 of these non @-@ binding reservations are currently ring@@ ing in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation up to now about 12 percent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
2018 - all models - 500@@ ,000 - will be one million by 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k there are currently 1800 reservations per day .
who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new production lines which have never been tested in practice with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
if it comes to larger delays , then the inevit@@ ability of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running in dro@@ ves .
EPA leader P@@ ru@@ itt reti@@ res because of the delay in the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
one day after he was accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the chief of the environmental protection authority , accepted his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when its agency proved to be responsive to the needs of national environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the suit which had been raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
it is a time limit that went off for States on October 1 to comply with the 2015 standards of ground o@@ zone .
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay the observ@@ ance for a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; interfere in local decisions or interfere with economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma before his appointment , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly gone over to blocking or del@@ aying regulations that resist the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ it regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA authority exceeded its authority when trying to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states by the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often not comp@@ lied with the dead@@ lines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement to determine the date for execution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who compl@@ ained the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and the authority that is given to us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the EPA statement that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available authority &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the provisions are based on solid policies and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Republi@@ cans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive re@@ constitution of the O@@ zone rules .
a draft approved last month is to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet voted in the Senate .
the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who ch@@ aired the Coalition of States who had su@@ ed the EPA in this week said that the group is inten@@ ding to maintain the legal pressure .
&quot; the revers@@ al of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important benefit to health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g who flows into their communities , &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man .
in this case , New York was joining California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ian , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone arises when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight .
the resulting smoke can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year .
representatives of public health and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered on P@@ ru@@ it &apos;s surprising change of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d from Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump @-@ government to turn to environmental pollution and its particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen was invited to a seren@@ ade on Sunday 16th July at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historical St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to stay .
the visitors of the Six@@ th Bene@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the place have made the friends and suppor@@ ter Tum@@ lin@@ gens a concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in written documents in the Württem@@ ber@@ gian document : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church to Tum@@ lingen including the &quot; Vog@@ bey &quot; in Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the wording of the document , on the hill of Tum@@ linger , apart from the former parish church , there was also a beautiful courtyard , to which the church or the patron saint belonged and not the other way round .
so there were also people there .
as seen from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , besides the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today are still recognizable in the local image of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the magnificent settlement of the village .
old maps dating back to 1600 are under@@ lined by these historical facts .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval church right .
a gent@@ leman who built a church , furnished and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also bequ@@ e@@ ath@@ ed this self @-@ church .
this ent@@ ailed the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .
there were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two breaks at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over later during the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were ham@@ mer@@ ed and the bel@@ fry were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aking .
in 17@@ 96 French troops camped near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and the church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the ruins of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demoli@@ shed .
only the church tower was left .
during the New Year &apos;s Eve 18@@ 34 a storm broke the steep@@ le and half collap@@ sed .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was broken off .
only the tower @-@ wer@@ ve existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today , Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em are cultiv@@ ating the Hil@@ arius plant by Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn as success@@ ors to Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
as organis@@ ers , the friends and promot@@ ers invite Tum@@ lin@@ gens on Sunday 16th July to the sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery to the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
this is designed by the com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann , a local leader , speaks the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 .
to conclude the seren@@ ade a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organis@@ ers the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organis@@ ers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of significance for tum@@ ours and hearing wel@@ ders .
the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin@@ gens are particularly committed to their home care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade organizer Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ ms .
association wants to allow approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim refuses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not fores@@ ee a legal basis for the construction and has therefore appe@@ aled to the coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim we@@ ars itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has called upon Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to accept his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette no wind turbines would have been allowed , since at the time in Vier@@ sen only a wind power concentration zone existed at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time , the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones should prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ par@@ agus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind @-@ force @-@ zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette a few days before by a change of the land @-@ use plan - but the district government Düsseldorf had not approved , because of a form @-@ defect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning law , the granted approval certificate remains un@@ lawful and therefore also withdrawn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break , the town council once again approved the wind conc@@ entri@@ c zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is where the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the call .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding writing has been in the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes it as an occasion to examine the matter once more .
however , they probably do not lead to the fact that the procedure is stopped .
with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to cont@@ end with the argument of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four each 200 @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen was directly involved , had concluded lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares large area .
the construction of the four wind turbines is expected to cover the electricity demand of around 11 400 households - that is roughly one fifth of the electricity demand of all four @-@ day households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sen &apos;s city council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor crash together : woman dies in terrible accident

a woman was injured in a deadly way .
two other persons were easily injured .
the state road was closed for hours .

&quot; &quot; &quot; city and merchants plan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; home shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -@@ weekend &quot; &quot; &quot;
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region will re@@ discover the shopping opportunities in the city center in September .
the commercial association and the city administration wish to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to enti@@ ce the inhabitants to shopping in the city center .
as the Chairman of the Trade Association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend will sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers to which offers their own city provides away from the usual supermarket commodity .
according to this , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , local companies should present themselves with their apprentices@@ hips .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city center are to invite for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; midnight sh@@ opp@@ ings &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the surrounding region .
in preparation , commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend are Christian König .
municipal administration and commercial association co@@ operating with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with this , the commercial association and the city go to another stage of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Attrac@@ tive City &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes new offerings such as the first &quot; active day &quot; to the well @-@ sale of well @-@ selling Sundays , talks with all the business@@ men and hosts , in order to move them to active participation .
attractive offers on Saturday and the aband@@ on@@ ment of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , customer potentials are to be re@@ opened or re @-@ opened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals have lost the city center while shopping from the view .
in the end everybody would have to contribute to li@@ ven up the inner city - to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs .
it was necessary to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that partly had grown , king had said in the spring .
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the Chamber of Commerce in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that the third &quot; home shopping &quot; day , for the first time , will participate in five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities for the first time .
besides Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heili@@ gen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should promote &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the appreciation of the local trade and emphas@@ ise its importance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the promotion under the leadership of the I@@ HK and with many partners makes it clear that every citizen can influence his / her sales behaviour directly .

Tr@@ ump put under pressure after le@@ aked tran@@ scripts from phone calls Mexico due to the payment of the boundary wall
tran@@ scripts of phone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tr@@ ump asked in a telephone conversation with the Mexican President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to to stop publicly saying he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US President insul@@ ted him because he had den@@ ounced the wall publicly . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You cannot tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and to leave Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull reports that a trade for the US refugees immig@@ rated to Australia is &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was im@@ par@@ ted by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the US .
Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call after he said Mr Turn@@ bull , &quot; This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activists manage rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ spe@@ c Ford Mer@@ cury passed through a group of spectators in the Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with ri@@ fl@@ es to block its way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a needle @-@ strip @-@ suit - took a long train at his ci@@ gar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors the in@@ mates flo@@ ated in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ aming broke the silence when a young black man was drag@@ ged from the passenger seat .
fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , is just a post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience ki@@ cked out very real si@@ ghs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 civil rights activists went back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were g@@ yn@@ g@@ gl@@ ed by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever accused of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our congregations , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps with the organisation of post @-@ creation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is a stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man of Georgia and a life @-@ long civil rights activ@@ ist .
it serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to receive justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot return to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court physician establishes a bed cloth on the cor@@ p@@ se of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on 27 July 1946 .
according to the FB@@ I files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but no one ever was accused .
although the susp@@ ects stay free for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice enabled the black citizens to vote in Georgia for the first time in the election campaign in summer .
approximately at the same time as the choice st@@ ach according to the FB@@ I , the black color monitor Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , down during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that the rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester had slept with Dor@@ othy with Mal@@ co &apos;s wife and that the baby she bore was not from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
but when they got away from the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and arranged the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an FB@@ I report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement , which was not only involved in murder , eliminating the evidence and testi@@ fying the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks puts it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an electoral law massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you register and when you vote , it will happen to you here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has conducted the annual follow @-@ up of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
her presentation is descri@@ p@@ tive , po@@ ign@@ ant and is rooted in a kind of deep rac@@ ism that many would like to believe that in America he no longer exists .
it is hard to watch , and more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve done through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest bl@@ acks - pushed into a room and listened to a well @-@ rehear@@ sed review of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ Director .
he has played the role of chief executive member for many years , but he said the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not like that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester sh@@ outs and har@@ dens him , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said n --- He , get out of my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ras@@ cona &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; respon@@ ds to the fire . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what ? ! , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ch@@ ick . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think white people back then &apos; n --- he &apos; said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yet , one of the other black actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you only have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ i@@ onship replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time , when Raz@@ oli says the N word , he says it sharply and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
there are scre@@ ams , shots , and then silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman suffering from mour@@ ning is about the cor@@ p@@ se of the actors and performs Bil@@ lie Holidays in mour@@ ning glory &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen viewers s@@ nat@@ ch sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost uni@@ form@@ ly divided between black and white .
a couple arrived from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only the road .
they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive moisture for nearly eight hours , when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the bur@@ ial places of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch kill@@ ings took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y .
when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead bodies .
children sit on their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they &apos;re not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little boy mur@@ m@@ urs as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the rope and wipe away their tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw embra@@ ces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit that the clan member has played .
Nick Ras@@ cona hu@@ gs two of his fellow players and then breaks together in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she whis@@ pers one of the women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done it for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience joined the actors for dinner .
at one table , a white pair of Atlanta talks about the post @-@ creation with a black couple that they have just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words that had left the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and who do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ch is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Today this is called Police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone presses Broo@@ ks farm at his table , he eats and reminds of civil rights .
he said he had already begun to plan the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post @-@ creation is in a certain way inspiring , as it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is like we don &apos;t learn from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ sts to Bayreuth
also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf employs a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous production in front of a gigantic six @-@ story scene .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by A@@ lek@@ sand@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows either a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with the Wall of Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from G@@ DR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car par@@ ked , in which the Rhine @-@ le@@ pers pose as a rock @-@ r@@ attle , or alternatively a Is@@ etta .
stack@@ ed oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power and gre@@ ed - which runs through his &quot; ring &quot; st@@ aging .
the three Rhein@@ daughters - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl und Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as well as in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot;
k@@ ess mis@@ lead Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , si@@ pping a cor@@ p@@ se into the luggage compartment in Hollywood @-@ style and giving the Kra@@ ich@@ o cli@@ que .
Stephen Mill@@ ing sings the wonderfully nasty Ha@@ gen that surrounds the aura of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ ers .
brut@@ ally the scene when he s@@ miles Siegfried .
later , Gun@@ ther ( Markus O@@ ak ) has to believe in it .
the audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause .
fo@@ sters , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are che@@ ered stor@@ m@@ ingly . he is modest and the hands of the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te are bent .
there is a big applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in more casual sports@@ wear .
the performance was eag@@ erly awa@@ ited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors .
if in 2013 he had to let go of a gig of the Pfei@@ f@@ konzert , five years later there was a great jubil@@ ation in which the individual &quot; bu@@ h &quot; calls went down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have been happy about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one notices that the audience with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has grown together in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it has also grown into an understanding of its viewpoint .
I draw a positive summary .
Max quantity works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture market , once a week I am here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I worked at school in an open whole day .
what are your experiences with that ?
quantity : it is a beautiful , wide spectrum I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years old , so a late @-@ time volunteer .
how does that come about ?
quantity : I have graduated from high school .
and then a civil engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully broken off .
I realized for myself that it is the wrong for me and I want to do something different to work with people .
and then I asked what are you doing .
do a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on the spot , in the focal point perhaps , really .
and was it so ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester .
I will study dual , probably make a social worker training in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er Service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it probably always depends where you make your FS@@ J .
it is possible to do it from retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon service .
for me it was exactly the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
unlike in Civil Engineering ?
quantity : well , here it is not a matter of calculating st@@ atics .
one has again and again other people head , each having a very different story behind them .
whether a refugee whether a teen@@ ager who has been taken out of the family - you must always deal with it individually .
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have any reservations ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
a lot of love , a lot of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is the same .
Pear@@ son pl@@ ung@@ es more 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend for rel@@ aun@@ ching business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that she will cut more 3,000 jobs and cut their divi@@ den@@ ds by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure the company faces .
the job cuts , which the Director General John Fall@@ on , mainly announced for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 , will in addition to his previous restructuring , in which 4,000 jobs have already been lost .
in May , in a third cost @-@ cutting program , Pear@@ son announced a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in order to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning .
the company , which last month sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year remained unchanged , having achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kab@@ ul con@@ vo@@ y attack : NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
a suicide bom@@ ber has attacked a military con@@ vo@@ y in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , said officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter had been viol@@ ated , shared a statement by NATO .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district .
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in an opinion of Nato it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening had happened when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device . &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and are treated in the U.S. military hospital at Bag@@ ram .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Tali@@ ban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the UN , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian fat@@ alities in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of which in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Tali@@ ban said they had executed this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the most deadly milit@@ ant attack in the country since the US @-@ led troops forced the Tali@@ ban from power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , since U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering increasing the number of U.S. forces supporting the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul also have caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies , and in particular the reputation of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA revers@@ es decision to delay the smo@@ g rule by law@@ suits around
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , repe@@ aled that states are obliged to reduce the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place a day after 15 states def@@ end@@ ant the agency because of the step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to prop@@ el the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ zone provisions 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said that they show the agency &apos;s obligation to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in the dialogue and that we react to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA leader Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA to measure the o@@ zone regulations - in which pollut@@ ant emissions are to be measured in a part of the country in order to define where cuts must be made to delay the stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 largely democratic states , along with Colombia &apos;s district , filed a complaint on Tuesday and said the effort was illegal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a wide range of environmental regulations , which the former President Barack Obama has imposed as part of a broader agenda to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , efforts have triggered the set@@ backs of democr@@ ats and nature conservation groups that are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA website says that inhal@@ ing air that contains o@@ zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contains lung function and can ampli@@ fy respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
common room for common room
at the end , the decision was clear : in two opposing voices , the council of flu@@ o @-@ win@@ ks decides to establish a common room in the future retirement home .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing plot is signed , mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden reports .
although it will still take time until the area of the congregation is still owned by the congregation , there is now no planning obstacle for the project to be st@@ em@@ ming by a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common room .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - some 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a surface area of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council are in front of such a common room not to be seen as a meeting point for the residents of the people &apos;s just living , but openly into the congregation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the word from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ nit@@ café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget has already been decided by funding opportunities last autumn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the construction is in the renovation area .
the establishment of a communal space would be , so reported T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible .
the proposal proposed to indicate to the investor that in this regard there is no bil@@ let between the legs , the as@@ certain@@ ment that both sem@@ it@@ rail@@ er - which is le@@ aning against the surrounding construction - as well as pent roof - which reduces the amount of tr@@ uss and makes the construction more economical - would be possible .
need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer thinks this addition .
if it helps : unanim@@ ously , it happens to the body .
it &apos;s not that easy with the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call points to the many buildings you don &apos;t get along with , but now you lean back in the common room out of the window , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m really doing it with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger also appeals to the common room - but absolutely against communal participation .
it sees behind it a hidden subsi@@ dy of already wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case because with the acquisition of the surface one does not grant a grant , but receive a real , in case of doubt the market value which is market@@ able in doubt , is the counter @-@ speech .
on the request of Sta@@ ig@@ ner &apos;s proposal to adopt the proposal , three advoc@@ ates are found .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus it remains with two counter@@ parts in the original programme that Stefan H@@ aller summari@@ zes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we summari@@ ze the decision , we make a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with car : cycli@@ st is thrown on the road
on the crossing of the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and was severely injured .
just as the police informed , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the bike path of the Schwar@@ zer trail in the direction of Hil@@ den on the bike path at 12.@@ 20 o &apos;clock .
the senior wanted to cross the road in the amount of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver in the same direction was given priority .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder was driving on the road , he evi@@ dently did not pay attention to the on@@ coming traffic .
he met a car which was a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ erin .
the man was thrown into the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a retreat car .
FC Bayern Munich must ren@@ ounce the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to let the game play against Dortmund .
with human resources the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory match of the new season .
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , the German football record master Bayern München is getting bigger and bigger at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to ren@@ ounce to David Al@@ aba in du@@ el with BV@@ B .
this confirmed the Italian on Friday .
also , Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six trials , An@@ cel@@ otti has been responsible for the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the team &apos;s balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not good at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory match of the season .
&quot; soccer is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intelli@@ gently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who anticip@@ ates a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans .
the game was sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , announced the German Soccer League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday .
walking in the Harz from Star to Star
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Harz , the nation &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the intention of the Observ@@ atory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a planetary route is available in Göttingen since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is coming to meet the need for information of many visitors , it was said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase of the year , the association is planning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in@@ quired is St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the boards should be updated by internet .
for this reason , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of the location .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later , the Star@@ line Ticket is to be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star path , the viewers experience a lot of interesting facts , such as the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also learned why stars would have different colors or why a star appeared more light than another , although it was essentially more distant .
it is also taught in which con@@ stellation you find a selected star and when it is best to see .
since 2014 , the association operates in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg the highest @-@ situated observ@@ atory in Northern Germany .
according to the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
frequently from there are the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye clearly visible .
on the initiative of the Förder@@ verein planet@@ arium Göttingen since 2003 , there is something similar to the planned star wer@@ g - the planet path .
starting from Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary Trail leads up to H@@ ain@@ berg and the Observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; off @-@ ground &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( Municip@@ ality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to dem@@ oted to the d@@ warf planet at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun at exactly 75 meters far exceeds 70 centimet@@ ers .
the total distance of the planet path is approximately four kilometres .
while the sun requires about eight hours from the sun to the Plu@@ to , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
thus , pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fixed star however would take half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who should stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , to Gar@@ cia , the failed World Bo@@ xing Council lightweight champion , down the hall to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organisation super @-@ spring weight champion .
after Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory by unanim@@ ous decision about the former Four @-@ Di@@ visions World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday in Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it like you , Champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 o &apos;clock on ES@@ PN .
when the pair posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ ma noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former weight of the spring , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ alled Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I got up for bronze &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to come down to lightweight .
and he must move towards wei@@ ght@@ weight wei@@ lers &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that demand the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko acknowledged .
&quot; boxes need this fight . &quot;
climate asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 @-@ pound @-@ debut this year to arrange a date with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their lightweight title fight in the forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight might take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans have asked for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said , and later insist@@ ed openly on fighting on the network offering the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he appreciated Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may participate in his Saturday fight .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko was with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said he was thinking the tri@@ athlon champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks &quot; very slow , I &apos;m sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the co @-@ off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact strength , then boxes .
both said they could feel the momentum that was built up for his own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the struggle that needs to be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great battle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four Ver@@ ses to T@@ ire Plat@@ ters
in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were seriously injured in the afternoon on Thursday afternoon .
after initial information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control of his vehicle shortly before the connection point market @-@ wide presumably after a punc@@ ture .
the car hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ came and then remained on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four in@@ mates - two adults and two children - were severely injured during the accident .
during the first provision of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was locked in the direction of the north for about an hour , then traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; triple chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hoping for the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener against Braunschweig that optim@@ ising the defense formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first match of the season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , because not the two opponents had been against Braunschweig at 2 : 2 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to watch out even better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ enders of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the three @-@ chain is also to be further optimised .
and a gate after a free fall does not want to catch the For@@ tun@@ en any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be like this for the future that nobody will stand on the line next to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better prepared for the experience in preparation with the supply chain than with the qu@@ ad chain .
&quot; still , I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ le , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we are in the three @-@ chain on the half positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gieß@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the condition is , but that we harmon@@ ize even better and we do not make so many mistakes in construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann will drive to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it doesn &apos;t know if you can talk about a mis@@ leading start after an accident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be ok , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we are on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to talk about a good season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing about that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I judge the start into the season only after six to eight days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ le , who didn &apos;t want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of Saxony had to be demoli@@ shed in Hei@@ den@@ heim for an accident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ ell and Hoffmann that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her as they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a promotion favorite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know that 100 percent where they are currently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the inner def@@ enders of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although guests from the Rhin@@ eland go as a light favour@@ it on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; that we swe@@ ep them away , just because we have the right to come under the first six , is stupid , &quot; says Funk@@ le , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e in nine games .
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which you have to beat in advance , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as Chief Coach .
&quot; to make such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so Funk@@ y doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of Swedish asylum candidate application tests published
the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , who have under@@ gone a new method of medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 percent of people being tested are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authorities for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( Rä@@ t@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ ald ) started the tests last year .
during the asylum process , they should take a closer look at the assessment of the age after the Swedish Migration Service ( Mig@@ ration@@ verk@@ et ) has been critic@@ ised for errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees who were minor .
to date , Mig@@ ration@@ verk@@ et has sent 6.@@ 8@@ 80 cases to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under the age of 18 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the person &apos;s age is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there are 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det evaluated the 5@@ 81 published results , she noted that in 243 of these cases the person openly said that she was 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , during X @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also critici@@ zed in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the en@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves ass@@ essing the biological maturity of people to see if they were going through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later than usual .
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used .
judging the biological age in this way is very un@@ safe .
if we cannot say it safely , we shouldn &apos;t do as if we could , &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro .
Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; generally , you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg proceed well .
on Wednesday , a seven tons heavy concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it works great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , forem@@ an at the Department of Road and Transport in the Regier@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the work started simultaneously on all three of the three re@@ building bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the end of the building is planned for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule is adher@@ ed to .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a arch bridge made of concrete , which is cla@@ d with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has come into the years now .
in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three structures are now thoroughly refurbished .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 meters long .
on Wednesday morning on the northern side , the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has got a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bridge cap .
this is a border fast@@ ener , which is also used as operating system .
on Friday , a 2.@@ 20 m wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is to run .
the special thing about this is that it is finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridges .
special finger tip feeling has required the laying of lines through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable that many companies are connected to .
the residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
in addition , fish and cru@@ st@@ ac@@ eans had to be f@@ ished .
traffic is regulated by traffic lights for the bridges between the building yard and the con@@ glomer@@ ation in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg .
for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach village entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the altitude of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully closed .
the cost of the three bridge arrangements amounts to 700 000 euros .
the whole is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : colorful protest at German potato salad
it doesn &apos;t happen so often that parties are pulling together , but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to reconci@@ le .
the parties represented in the district of Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peac@@ efully this day because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle rac@@ ell invites &quot; large election campaign clock . &quot;
and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land will be the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are already on site before the start of the event don &apos;t want to listen to the Af@@ D people , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
originally the city picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at one table &quot; on the fountain area , but now takes place on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful picture that offers itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ woman of the Forum A World and one of the leading organizers , is really pleased : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great , how many people came together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; ancient potato salad , which also the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; says the woman who brought him along .
the police have ordered many civil servants to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence in particular at the station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ D Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel reports that he stri@@ ves for such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes there were not enough parking spaces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a view of the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is also done : around 8@@ pm there is a band for entertainment at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , in the Stad@@ thalle several speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D Chairman Uwe Young .
about 200 listeners in the hall are waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch to talk about their speeches .
the police presence remains unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour takes the Af@@ D event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can move away - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ art tro@@ mb@@ one Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ konz@@ erte tomorrow , Sunday , at 8@@ pm in the monastery church .
together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the conc@@ er@@ ted Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both combines the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
this is how Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new garment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz player N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free play blend into a fascinating synthesis of arts .
this cent@@ er@@ piece of the program was first performed in Freiburg with great success .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher monastery church with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart speaks about their bi @-@ sexu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I would like to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart openly about their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite in grilled cheese , I think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship between Hollywood stars was the &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who eventually dealt very bitter@@ ly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the brunette Dar@@ stell@@ ess ass@@ ures the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was really in love with everyone I had . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I would have played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her separation Kri@@ sten admitted that she is bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived du@@ alism and seriously believed in it .
so it never interfer@@ ed or hin@@ ders me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I just never liked to be taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she especially suffered , according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in school times when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven the children told me that I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girls , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public does not like to explain their love life : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you to relate to a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like having to justify myself before the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... Today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republi@@ cans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a coach I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump previously promised a big announcement from the West Virginia R@@ ally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes notes that he has coal mines in five states , and his father inherited a coal business .
it is worth about $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime , on Thursday evening , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; the party change by Gover@@ nor Justice is yet another blow for a Democratic Party that would rather hin@@ der us from working on it to make our country a great one . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and controlling the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is just the last rejection of a party from above to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , influential message , &quot; said the R@@ NC pres@@ i@@ ding Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised the Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed into the sport .
Russia &apos;s Ath@@ le@@ tics leader D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ lac@@ t@@ ine said during the IA@@ AF conference on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct and that he was determined to fight dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were taken away from competitions gold and silver med@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found evidence on state @-@ supported dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the repor@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized by itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepts the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think that progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; Co@@ e said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle always was that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics World Championships , which begin on Friday in London , according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the leader of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for re @-@ adjusting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told repor@@ ters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tragedy for soldiers who have crashed in Mali
at a funeral service in the North Hes@@ sian F@@ ritz@@ lar , around 1,000 people of the two soldiers were commemor@@ ated at a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high safety precau@@ tions .
to the still un@@ explained cause of the fall , Minister of Defence , Ursul@@ a von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) , said nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but she called the two reverse pilots as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; benef@@ actors &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow to the highest sacrifice they have made in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old Chief of Staff from Northern H@@ esse had come to life on Wednesday a week ago in West Africa .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a vi@@ gi@@ l of the Bundes@@ wehr into the F@@ ritz@@ ker cathedral Saint Peter .
at mid@@ day only the relatives of the church took leave .
after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Federal Ar@@ med Forces Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
the gri@@ ev@@ ous ro@@ ses lay down ro@@ ses , the relatives were arm in arms on the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church , F@@ ritz@@ ker and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Defence of the Le@@ yen described the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot;
the commander @-@ in @-@ chief had built up the flying operation of the helicopter tiger in F@@ ritz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regi@@ ment , to whom the soldiers belong , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this crew could not turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show Prime Minister of the Le@@ yen : the deployment is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral service the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik doesn &apos;t want a grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife after his death .
this shared the Royal House on Thursday .
the Danish royal couple is traditionally buried in Ros@@ kil@@ de &apos;s Cathedral Church .
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision to continue her message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik was buried , be still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
following the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .
in 2016 he retired and also laid down the title &quot; Prinz@@ reg@@ communion . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark not to be equal to his wife - not after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the principal speaker of the Danish royal family , declared .
where the last resting place of the 83 year old will ultimately be , is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years .
born in 1965 in London , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ tra@@ z@@ at , the son of a French aristoc@@ ratic family , met in London .
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French Embassy .
while his later wife always flew on to the sympathy of the people , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his nearly 50 @-@ year reign over the Dan@@ es .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik expressed over the first few years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival all I did was critic@@ ised .
my Danish was pregnant , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stum@@ ps instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation to be the brand of socio @-@ critical intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants a quick re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
Nieder@@ sach@@ sen &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green majority of government for a quick re @-@ election of parliament , but he does not want to res@@ ign .
he spoke on Friday for the dissolution of the parliament .
previously , the surprising withdrawal of a Green Party de@@ pu@@ ties from its state parliament in Lower Saxony precip@@ itated the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the Parliament election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous Green Party Member El@@ ke T@@ westen combined their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in its constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ üm@@ me ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD@@ U leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ üm@@ ler wants to recommend his faction to accept it .
thus , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had together 69 seats in the Lower Saxony State Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far , the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be elected regular on 14th January of the year .
Th@@ ang@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government must decide now whether to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority .
however , Stephan Wei@@ l thinks it is essential that the Land@@ tag decides as quickly as possible its self @-@ resolution .
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on how to proceed on Tuesday .
the state constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the Land@@ tag would depri@@ ve the Prime Minister of his trust and elect a successor .
&quot; our Constitution provides several options .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these options must be checked legally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ang@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will discuss all questions in peace if they are judi@@ ci@@ ally checked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; th@@ um@@ ler called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ western &apos;s step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something strange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself pointed out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not a tra@@ it@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;

she described herself as a tra@@ it@@ or of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the back@@ sliding members to return their country &apos;s mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume , of course , that she returns to her country report , which she has received from the green regional list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president An@@ ja P@@ iel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we greatly regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she deliberately decided not to pron@@ ounce any pron@@ unciation in the group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no substan@@ tive differences , we cannot comprehend this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transition of Lower Saxony &apos;s Green Party de@@ pu@@ ties to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Green Party de@@ pu@@ ties in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the Social Democrats head on Facebook on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly elect the Land@@ tag .
the withdrawal of the v@@ est costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her late vanity and fru@@ stration is her personal interests in front of the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony manages this dirty intri@@ gue and tries to make political capital out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lower Saxony &apos;s CD@@ U leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ üm@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to include El@@ ke T@@ jackets into the CD@@ U .
the president of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , proposed T@@ jackets to fal@@ si@@ fy the results of the 2013 Parliament election with personal car@@ eers .
the CD@@ U was at that time the strongest power , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority in a vote in the Land@@ tag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Agriculture in an interview - How do we protect ourselves from gre@@ ed , Herr Schmidt ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany disc@@ usses about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal erup@@ t ?
how can consumers be protected ?
Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , is in an interview with the editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Schmidt , How can the consumer protect himself from pois@@ oned eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to check eggs in your fridge and check stamp printing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information on the affected eggs @-@ bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if , according to all we currently know , a health hazard is practically impossible .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier from the Federal Minister of Agriculture is not really perceived ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless my house has un@@ due immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany &apos;s involvement .
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
just like the manufacturers , the trade has to ensure that the products sold are transpor@@ table and harmless to health .
if the residual value of 0.00@@ 5 mg / kg is exceeded in case of eggs , these are not pass@@ able .
un@@ poll@@ uted eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time the factories are not to blame .
are factories and consumers in the same boat ?
according to the current state of knowledge , the production facilities are not directly responsible .
on the contrary , due to presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies , they must expect economic damage .
as always , there are too few controllers in the case of seri@@ ousness .
is there only a lack of staff or a conclu@@ sive competence ?
it was precisely the official controls that have revealed the process .
however , it is also true that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out by 100 percent .
it is precisely for this reason that a logical explanation of such events and the hand@@ over to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where criminal off@@ ences can be present are of decisive importance .
I have already made it clear several times that I expect a complete enligh@@ tenment from the responsible authorities .
is regular alar@@ mis@@ m in food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to only get safe and transpor@@ table food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an un@@ authorised insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company , retailers and consumers have come into a situation that is absolutely not necessary because of the imp@@ acted means .
in principle , it must be clear that the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ producing animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately .
this must be done consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
I expect all responsible authorities to quickly and comprehen@@ sively explain the facts .
how the soccer rules of football have impact on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered issues of European football clubs will not interfere with N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Barcelona to Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come from UEF@@ A for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main , as the conduc@@ tive organization that monitors the European game has the power to prohi@@ bit teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules launched by UEF@@ A in 2011 mean that PS@@ G has to demonstrate at some point that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to get the Brazi@@ li@@ ans out of their contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can certainly make money easy for N@@ ey@@ mar to sign and bring him to a gal@@ axy of other stars in the face of the financing of the team by the energy @-@ rich ruling family of Qatar .
associations may use a lot of money to buy players , but they have to deal with legitimate income sources that enable the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs who had enormous debts in their quest for success were effectively dec@@ ei@@ ving and ris@@ king to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P moved from concentr@@ ating on the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel Abr@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder business .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P exp@@ ir@@ ation period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen in favour of the Pres@@ idency in 2015 , UEF@@ A successor , A@@ lek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ im , continues to be sc@@ ared of excessive spending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a l@@ ump sum , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing over the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the sales revenues for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 brought the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs to try to out@@ wi@@ t their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenue by companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a cat@@ ar@@ an enterprise could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , UEF@@ A would not allow it to be considered legitimate income .
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when UEF@@ A decided that the P@@ SA sponsor@@ ship was being infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come about payments from the 2022 Organ@@ izing Committee in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar are cont@@ ested that N@@ ey@@ mar World Cup Ambassador will become an ambassador and a such maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities could be easy to find out .
the sanctions against PS@@ G so far imp@@ ly that UEF@@ A will be more attentive to any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they talked about the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros has generated a profit of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year must still be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ship deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and jer@@ sey sales .
the association assumes that sales after signature will rise by at least 30 percent .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players and tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s move by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s final ownership of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ar@@ senal @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state financed by an association .
&quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday .
&quot; once a country owns an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it becomes very difficult to respect the financial fair play because one can go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a large actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new supplier
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y Board chocolate has made Swiss chocolate .
now the close cooperation is ahead of a possible end : the airline re@@ writes the order .
on request from the news agency , Swiss @-@ spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; on Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokesperson .
approximately 17 million small red @-@ white packed choc@@ ol@@ ates distribute to 14 grams per year the flight atten@@ d@@ ants before landing on the passengers .
Swiss did not want to provide information about the costs .
industry insi@@ ders estimate the order volume according to &quot; Nor@@ thwest Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a jo@@ g manufacturer .
Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants are interested in the new tender .
only Swiss manufacturers come into question .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the treaty over the spring of 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not able to make a statement .
Swiss has been distributing chocolate boards on board their flights since 2006 .
before the Swiss signed a contract with Mig@@ ros &apos;s daughter , Barry Cal@@ le@@ baut has delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
Swiss Life introduced the opportunity to place the logo two and a half years ago with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline co@@ operates with various Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ haul flights , the customers of the First Class will be spoiled with treats from the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in the Business Class passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi from Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and economy class , is also distributing on the short circuit .

nostal@@ gia goes to the niche in &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective . &quot;
this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &quot; s , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ Gr@@ unge era ( when the pre @-@ think@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show alter the Sk@@ etch com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to larger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era of permanent memories .
but as a fran@@ chise it feels like the time was short .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worked surprisingly well , not just because of his absurd hum@@ our ( it contained an original story for a speaking tin of vegetables spoken by H. J@@ on Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by sti@@ cking to the core of the gig - middle @-@ aged actors play cool kids who will grow up - nevertheless , they managed to reg@@ ain the im@@ possibility of winning the last part of the wi@@ t .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who are now playing adults , is less emo@@ tionally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more to the casting principle , among them a riff on the Stal@@ ker Films of the 90 &apos;s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The Hand which Sc@@ ales the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at one point , an Apple @-@ Power@@ Book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of other things from 1991 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gra@@ cious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ tic , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( K@@ en Marino ) still hasn &apos;t lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another ins@@ ane @-@ vi@@ cious plot , included in the Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ known impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
it is a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s sub @-@ lip of &quot; sing@@ les , &quot; whose former big @-@ man @-@ on @-@ camp Andy feels like an old cra@@ cker .
it is the moments of random ma@@ dness that could fuel this fran@@ chise like a kind of repeti@@ tive Seven Up ! series until he reaches what I consider his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose final scene will show the band how they will visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde and even to &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with his East vs. West ring fight icon@@ ography .
the com@@ edy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard boiled Greg@@ or and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alogues are synchron@@ ised by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice flags to watch ( the police spend time watching chess on TV as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Find out the voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ ag@@ an mask - that it often plays like a single one .
there are six long episodes , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; which was edited for a lower length , could better furnis@@ h his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p S@@ ati@@ re as Greg@@ ory and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a he@@ ap of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a food for a fortune .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own recent history and with thei@@ rs .
a blow against drug ma@@ fia in the country
the police succeeded in a strike against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , many objects were searched in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in Kon@@ stanz was on Friday .
15 accused were arrested between the ages of 25 and 77 and have already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
in addition , officials ensured greater amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros .
at the same time in Italy two persons were arrested .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects of Italy .
the two are therefore probably supplied to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
more than 300 police officers were deployed .
the Ma@@ fia &apos;s members are accused of organized drug traffi@@ cking , serious acts of violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has established Con@@ stance against organised drug traffi@@ cking in Southern Germany .
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo , there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , on Wednesday morning , the great deal was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
the aim of the investigations was mainly Italian nationals with close reference to the Italian ma@@ fia .
also a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account .
Weise compl@@ ains large gaps in the foreig@@ ner @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreig@@ ner @-@ register in Germany has considerable short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to partly serious mis@@ decisions in asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ gee Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the country @-@ central register .
defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to some serious mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; warned , in a way that the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; exists .
according to estimates , ten million people with foreign nationality are listed in the Register , including about 5.@@ 7 million people from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore administered by some 600 foreigners in Germany .
because the data has not been sufficiently well maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in isolated cases , data from 1921 was found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by people who are no longer alive or citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data entries can slow down reverse processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report continues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , in statistics about sufficient people , EU citizens are also gr@@ asp@@ ed who do not have to travel at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , such false alleg@@ ations led to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a distorted debate on how to deal with exports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently begun to return refugee families to Italy with under 16 years of age if they have travelled from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this results from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück@@ er Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper , it says that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BA@@ MF is introducing such procedures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , according to the newspaper , referring to the difficult situation on the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement it is responsible for refugees of the EU state , which they reach first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if an immig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can return it to the entry country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the office now writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has considerably increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy gave guarantees for the reception and accommodation of family warran@@ ties .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back there as part of the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the internal political spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ hand movement in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children thre@@ aten un@@ lawful reception conditions and a threat to child welfare due to short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 liters of blood from people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach were already available to other people in the blood donation service .
at least of the twelve citizens who received the award on Friday .
above all Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who meanwhile shared 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations .
traditionally , at the meeting of the Municipal Council , the congregation appl@@ au@@ ded the multiple willingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s brilliant how our body is designed for it and we want to give respect to the don@@ ors who make their blood available to strangers , not self @-@ serving , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the county manager of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , because the preserved foods are broken down into their constitu@@ ents .
that &apos;s how three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Ma@@ isen@@ bacher reported about the actions performed in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K district manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the change to the theatre house obviously resulted in higher numbers of participants a few years ago .
already before , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Stra@@ w@@ berry were among the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 contributions each .
half as many book Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ oth@@ ee Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter posted ten times each 500 milli@@ litres of their food .
Bank of England will hold the interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation about an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it retained the interest rates on family income in the midst of an intensified pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members seeking an increase in this month , as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 at 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on household income would continue , with inflation likely to rise to just under 3 % in autumn .
but it sign@@ alled that in the next few years , interest increases would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation triggered by the Bre@@ x@@ it and it said that credit costs may have to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw part of the M@@ amm@@ ut Business Cycle that was issued a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the coming February , although it has been said that it will now provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - at 115 billion pounds sterling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to be bur@@ dened by consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the interest rates reiter@@ ated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy would be required for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; greater extent than the markets would expect .
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the bank stressed that increases were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incre@@ mental &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts for this year and next year are expected to rise by 1.9 % and 1.7 % in May .
it maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened rising expectations on interest rise and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % rose to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly after the end of the year .
the recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and minor salary increases , as the tigh@@ tening is first to be worse before improving .
she added that in the next few years , monetary policy cannot &quot; prevent &quot; in@@ comes , &quot; but she added that wages are &quot; clearly &quot; rec@@ u@@ per@@ ated at the end of their three @-@ year forecast .
the economy is also bol@@ stered by the rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound , which will compensate for a portion of lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes a year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote causing the sin@@ king of the pound .
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years to fully achieve the prices and the economy .
prior to the Bank &apos;s last judgment on interest rates , the call for interest increased , as inflation increased the pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers in July demanding an increase to 0.5 % .
inflation decreased from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said it was expected and will attract it again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that the excess in relation to its target of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wholly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attributable to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrew Mont@@ t , director of Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the recent decline of the swa@@ p rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive again , as the len@@ ders are looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals exp@@ ire and new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) should prescri@@ be the controversial HIV drug of 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment in September following a fight in front of the High Court against the funding of the medicine at N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ posi@@ tional phy@@ lac@@ tic prevention ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , has now been delivered by the Health Service on a first three year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed last year a ruling by the Supreme Court that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it .
this Thursday announced move was welcomed by N@@ HS England leader Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National A@@ ids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to make the registration of people possible , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be launched in April 2018 .
pre @-@ exposure pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a sequence of HIV medicines taken before sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in infection risk .
pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics , suitable candidates are identified who agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV @-@ status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy .
people who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also opt @-@ in for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence as it is used on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continued progress in tackl@@ ing one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National A@@ ids Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , if targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Executive Board of Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is carried out swiftly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , as the pre@@ p test medicine was pro@@ cured , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , shadow health minister , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcomed and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt gives us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that it will contribute to a step closer to the termination of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
live the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former Bank@@ erin with a passion for real estate , reduced itself from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to an Ear@@ ls Court Apartment in 2014 .
it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; Jo@@ anne said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was looking for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot was completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room estate with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add a cup of storage space and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , plenty of light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that was my request , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over@@ lap so that the architectural challenge consisted in creating a mezzanine where you could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to release the award .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with much additional drama .
a classic copper light window by Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area for the mezzanine .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and lighting .
at both ends a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to let it work for longer .
in the kitchen , the mirr@@ oring feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all corners and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
by perc@@ ei@@ ving a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
folding kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important , so that when you push the door , it gli@@ des very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space Jo@@ anne was able to gain an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day , you will sell the base area - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the soil size . &quot;
here they have managed to increase the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t fall in love with electrical outlets in the walls .
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and an increased square meter number of some standard into something quite amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave this .
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire
two brothers spent four decades after their Italian family founded the Dy@@ nasty , in a dispute because of one of the biggest real estate imperialist Victori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets are to be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp argument about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers collected 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family purchased a business at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there , the West@@ co je@@ ans family founded je@@ ans and grew to a chain of 160 retail outlets .
it was sold in 1999 for $ 85 million .
this money has been invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis portfolio now includes offices in the city center , Brun@@ swi@@ ck and Sor@@ ren@@ to &apos;s development areas , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after an agreement with her late father Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about a third . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court file states that this means that Col@@ in has a value of $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul has a value of 176 million dollars .
the distribution of real estate and cash proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the units proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .
the brothers now fight for control over the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , has excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul to manage some possessions in@@ compet@@ ently .
in an early aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it , submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; my Italian heritage dict@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the cost increases in the event , with hundreds of pages with affir@@ m@@ ations , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck C@@ ram@@ er , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and from both parties held law firms .
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delic@@ at@@ essen shops from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brun@@ swi@@ ck in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first Je@@ ans@@ drift of the family .
Col@@ in says that he started West@@ co there when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , were hoping to ben@@ ign their property to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land before the court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De Lu@@ tis Group , where Col@@ in claims that Mark has paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars on leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has become bitter about the conditions of its financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in was very reluc@@ tant , although he was a former AF@@ L member of the AF@@ L and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just Col@@ in answered by text message to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is in front of the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end up in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , adding that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our affair will be resolved by courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps appointed new Chief of Staff to limit the pres@@ idency &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kel@@ ly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Poli@@ tico reports that White House &apos;s new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course .
here is a piece by repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kel@@ ly , the White House &apos;s new Chief of Staff , met with senior executives on his first working day , he posed a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s White House that he wanted to repair : poor information coming into the hands of the president .
Kel@@ ly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnose makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame po@@ ump by monitoring his media diet .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s relationship to television goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if candidate Tr@@ ump has been upset because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of jobs that were to convince , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election campaign consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote in the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter Hab@@ its is under control , according to six ex @-@ election officials , to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter custom was ever &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
maybe these campaign officials know something that we don &apos;t know for others - that Tr@@ um@@ ps twe@@ ets would have included more fuel without their interventions .
we will probably never know about twe@@ ets that have not sent Tr@@ ump .
if his employees managed to keep it away from him a couple of times , their efforts paid off .
but no one has consistently prevented it from provo@@ king Tr@@ ump controversi@@ es .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump Material that may promote their views of the world .
Poli@@ tico - busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advis@@ ers to indu@@ ce du@@ bi@@ ous information to the president for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by Repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can react like a volcano to negative press @-@ outs , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he insi@@ sts on figur@@ ing out where these come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone mali@@ ci@@ ously offered a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; being the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was permanently ban@@ ished from Twitter due to har@@ ass@@ ment or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and began asking staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the paper@@ work . &quot;
how did that work out ?
Kel@@ ly tries three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors are still striving for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most wanted criminals receive mail from Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the help of the population is asked for and hoped for .
the police all over Europe will send ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous criminals in this summer ( virtual ) .
since the addresses of the sought @-@ after criminals are not known , references from the population are hoped and requested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday about the action that follows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent calendar from winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences had shown that many fle@@ ets were hiding at holiday destinations , it was called Euro@@ pol .
we have compiled 21 post@@ cards for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 there has been the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ technik , more than 2.5 million times it has been viewed .
36 of the online requests could be det@@ ained so far , at least eleven of them due to evidence after publication on the website .
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aire series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home owners of the West Mid@@ lands are again with some determined travellers on the base of the war , who have tra@@ ded a dit@@ ch drawn by the community to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a well @-@ to @-@ do road from Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire row &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were thrown out only in May , without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council to prevent their attacks .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were forwarded by Bentley He@@ ath where they threw stones on the p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council needs to be forced through shame to implement it as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the passengers were there in May , were moved on and are now back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more came last night , probably today even more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long instruction to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my charge if the Council cannot stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a local people who didn &apos;t want to be called said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is ridi@@ culous , we have just seen the last round of these travelers , only to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the parking area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the Soli@@ hull council said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to keep them as fast as possible .
in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Birken@@ hof will be Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the former Hotel Birken@@ hof will be the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on the 1st of March next year .
these are good news for the city .
after the closure of the Birken@@ hof by the then Ambiente equipment company mbH on April 13 , 2014 , approximately 30,000 overnight stays were lost at the time and also recei@@ pts due to the tourist tax .
in the autumn of 2014 , in view of the dramatic increase in numbers of refugees arriving in the district , the hotel building was offered to the district office as a collective accommodation offering controversial discussions .
the city prevented the placing of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the Municipal Council .
but especially Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s mayor , Julian O@@ ss@@ wald , defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties in the house .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ isen@@ gra@@ fico with managing director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern , acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof in a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it to a house of the three @-@ stars plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern and one in Bath Herren@@ al@@ b .
they are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof there have been building sh@@ utt@@ les in front of the entrance for quite some time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renovation works are carried out .
the floors were torn out , ceilings partly disman@@ tled , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still much to do by March .
&quot; it &apos;s actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is remo@@ del@@ ed , new windows are built @-@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beautiful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses himself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities .
you don &apos;t want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale downtown level , sh@@ aver points out .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms , wants to set up wide , explains the sh@@ aver further .
both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he already had talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , said Sch@@ erer .
the ideas of the city were con@@ gru@@ ous with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
asked about the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to specify exactly .
just under a million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the external systems are also brought to the front , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , a large terrace is created which will be accessible from the restaurant , which is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : U.S. Special Repres@@ ent@@ ator sets up Grand Jury
in the Russian affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special issu@@ er Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
in recent weeks , the Panel included the work , wrote the Wall Street Journal , calling on people familiar with the matter .
the paper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded and intensified his investigations .
the broad@@ ca@@ ster CN@@ N reported that there are already initial charges of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time being targeted in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller resear@@ ches whether there were agreements between Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign team and Moscow .
the investigation is focused on several men who acted as advis@@ ers to the Republi@@ cans in the election campaign .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took a close look at the private and business environment of Tr@@ um@@ ps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Sonder@@ gene@@ alog@@ ist Tr@@ ump entered the centre personally and accused the accus@@ ation that the President could possibly hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jury is to examine the present evidence in possible criminal cases and to decide whether charges are to be charged .
Grand Jury is therefore also called anchor clips .
most of the time , they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases .
the process always takes place behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be switched on by the public prosec@@ utor to charge people with an oath .
according to the CN@@ N broad@@ ca@@ ster , invitations have already been issued , which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement , called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ um@@ ps consultant and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ us@@ h@@ ner and his dam chief Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were also involved in the discussion .
legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the suspension shows that Mu@@ eller does not let himself intim@@ id@@ ate in his work and that if necessary , he wants to act quickly .
but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the collection of an indictment .
nevertheless , the establishment of the Gre@@ mi@@ um is the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause for concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revelations , on Thursday evening , the president used a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y the Russian Aff@@ air as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic gives the Democrats a way to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor , T@@ y Cob@@ b , stated in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .
but he also usually works in secret , he emphas@@ ised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House endor@@ ses any action that acceler@@ ates the work of the special agent in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair way &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former FB@@ I boss James Com@@ ey said three times that I will not be determined against the President . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one has no reason to assume that something has changed in it , it was said in the Declaration .
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this ro@@ oting , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump have become lou@@ der , he wants to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June , Com@@ ey said before a Senate committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to set up an investigation against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
after the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special issu@@ er and its employees .
this triggered speculation as to whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wants to release .
unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later retired President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired on the ur@@ ges of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators presented bill of law on Thursday that the special issu@@ er could not be dismissed as easily .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : giant ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the western Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg of the scar@@ c@@ ely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin was solved by the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
this shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the Kol@@ oss , which weighs about one tri@@ l@@ lion ton and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now driving north and will probably need two or three years until it was mel@@ ted .
with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ic@@ eber@@ gs that researchers have registered over the past three decades .
there is no danger for people from him .
according to research data , the extent to which climate change has played a role in the breaking down of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear .
for some 30 years , however , there has been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region for around 30 years , writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fact background .
according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming .
the broken @-@ off col@@ os@@ sus was so far part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by big glaci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America almost at the head of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
to the north of this ice shelf , the balance of wa@@ xing and break@@ age was disturbed some years ago .
a complete ice shelf will be broken down there , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is in danger , because the front edge has never gone so far as it is currently .
in addition , the ice sheet stands under tension and can crum@@ ble if a piece is broken at a key point .
the melting of ice shelf and ice mountain does not increase the level of sea level , as they float on the water and ice as much water as it follows after melting .
however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the glaci@@ ers flowing directly into the sea and much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only to a lesser extent , writes the British research project on the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth @-@ largest shelf of the Antar@@ ctic with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean approximately 200 meters .
there it breaks down regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there is no direct link to climate change , the ice sign is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest withdrawal since the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists is controversial whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s will continue to grow or fall back in the long term and possibly coinci@@ de , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even though these researchers do not return the demoli@@ tion of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , many of the ice @-@ mis@@ chi@@ ves of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen in the last decades .
this long skirt of the Antar@@ ctic stretches towards South America .
according to the research program British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the increase in temperature has contributed to the decline .
in the last 50 years , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has heated around three degrees and thereby count among the areas in which the temperature is the fastest .
CD@@ U wants to take home tari@@ ff at the staff
because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ an@@ cies , the CD@@ U asks to step out of the employers &apos; association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , 41 new jobs in the administration have subsi@@ ded .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the county administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have completed their first working day .
the courses at the circle are apparently very sought after .
there were approximately 6@@ 20 applications for the places to be found this year .
nevertheless , the group still lacks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
currently there are still 50 non @-@ occupied places at the M@@ ett@@ mann district .
among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the administration is to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is not only to cover short @-@ term needs with skilled workers but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application of applicants .
the overall concept should be oriented inside and outside , show concrete measures for cross @-@ entran@@ ts and include a training offensive , call for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is from a regular &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a high number of employees who leave the service due to disease or age reasons .
it is high time for action so that not even more jobs will remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , leader of the CD@@ U , still goes beyond the joint request with his party .
he made a big surprise already in the working day for a fist @-@ thick surprise when he publicly challenged personnel costs and st@@ un@@ ned the rest of the parties .
people want all the possibilities to be reviewed which enable an exit from the municipal employers &apos; association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come short @-@ term to a satisfactory solution , the county administration with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - should seek a house tari@@ ff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pe@@ op@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the CD@@ U is trying to pay the employees and officials better than fores@@ ees the opening of the tari@@ ffs for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently stipulated exactly , increases or more money is only available if you change to a higher level that is oriented towards career years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up , in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stit@@ uting protection law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy tigh@@ tens the tone for NGO migrants &apos; lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they are not allowed to continue this unless they stick to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat of the German Relief Organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ ail@@ ers &apos; because their team had worked effectively with human traffi@@ ckers in a way facilit@@ ating illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for one year , refused to comment on the detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Carto@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , saving human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in an opinion on the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot judge all accus@@ ations currently raised after we have gathered all the information and ass@@ essing the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October .
it is thought that its crew adop@@ ts din@@ gh@@ y migrants , which are delivered to them directly by human traffi@@ ckers , and that s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting was said to occur only 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast , according to the Prosecutor of the Prosecutor , whose contents were published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of taking over the authority of the Italian Co@@ ast@@ guard who supervis@@ es rescue missions in the area for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must have an Italian police officer on board who supervis@@ e their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to stick to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable as they would not bring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ate organization is Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
Minn@@ iti has now said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations had declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days , we have begun seeing light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month about economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and tri@@ als
nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin Foreign Post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the northern Pal@@ at@@ inate to enjoy trials and si@@ ght@@ se@@ ein@@ gs for four days .
three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the castle and wine festival of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome addition .
the first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
view points followed , partly on towers , from which one could look far above the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest and the up@@ stream planes .
in between there were always longer climb@@ s , for the long tri@@ als reward .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the Volks@@ fest saus@@ age market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; again , a look@@ out spot on the look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flo@@ wer@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the last two days a lot of al@@ timet@@ ers were announced .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and return h@@ uts brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed sal@@ ine br@@ ine in the open air inhal@@ atorium .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group had met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cultural .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga is equi@@ pping itself for e @-@ sports
do the sports stars in future sit in front of computer consoles instead of struggling with wind and weather over the stadium fur@@ rows ?
fact is : e @-@ sport has long become a serious industry , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high g@@ ages included .
this has also recognized the first federal li@@ ga@@ des that are increasingly engaged in this area .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and took up two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire new young audiences for the V@@ f@@ B &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is sure that many clubs will rise to this move . &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London organizes the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where gam@@ ers from different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke und Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven have qualified .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sports .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advises one agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds in particular that the young people are still going to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets , especially the Asian ones .
with prominent E @-@ athletes under contract , one could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the Bundes@@ liga to Asia .
what is it about ?
during the E @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or football simulation FIFA will focus on competition level .
as in normal sports , le@@ agues have long since established itself , in which the professionals compete against each other .
and E @-@ Sport is already part of the official programme at Asian Games 2022 .
but is it a real sport ?
for many , the idea is certainly habit@@ ual .
also In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ous dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne , e @-@ sports is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classical sports such as increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
in addition , it needs cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick reaction capability .
professional gam@@ ers should train not only on the console , but also their body and pay attention to the nutrition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , F@@ rob@@ atic also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult to perform in online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sport were missing .
the scientist emphas@@ ises the high @-@ integr@@ ative effect of E @-@ Sports .
the players are on the move at an international level , which is like a large global family , there are no cross @-@ cultural obstacles .
a study by the company consultation Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Inter@@ aktive Kart@@ software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in E @-@ sport .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsor@@ ship and big tournaments .
in three years , sales are expected to reach 130 million .
this is little against the nearly 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundes@@ liga .
however , the e @-@ sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte counsel@@ ors write .
many countries are already on the move .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where former basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez take part in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports competition supplier Uni@@ kr@@ n .
a lot is happening in Europe as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport has been introduced as a lesson , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says F@@ rob@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to D@@ utt , the football league associations in the Netherlands and France are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; Germany is lag@@ ging behind in the European comparison , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B board R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann .
only to fall into nostal@@ gia , and to elu@@ ci@@ date the old times , is no longer sufficient today .
it is about keeping the tradition of the association , but at the same time alig@@ ning the company to the modern market .
&quot; we live in a digital@@ ised world , &quot; says D@@ utt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t stick to the fact that only football remains as it always was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter condem@@ ns Con@@ rad Roy &apos;s texts for suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls to suicide .
Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their conviction behind bars and five years have been exposed to prob@@ ation .
Car@@ ter was sentenced in June due to negli@@ gent killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday during the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until the appointment .
she was faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and downward pointing eyes when she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life in order to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she showed no repentance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they completely depl@@ ore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Ju@@ dge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find out that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no day when I don &apos;t spend the loss of my beloved son . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try , in spite of all my pain that we will carry for eternity with us , to be there for his sisters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roy &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the realisation that she would never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or would be an a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to have this only person with whom I was together every day since my birth is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the case seems to set a legal preced@@ ent as there is no law in Massachusetts making it a crime to commit another to commit suicide . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case drew national attention after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she had encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wake up , hop from a building , build yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Car@@ ter &apos;s attention was sought by the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit from the case by any press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few who defended Car@@ ter , Am@@ anda Kno@@ x was convic@@ ted of murder of her British co @-@ resident in Italy in 2007 before being acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ che : learning from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m of FC Bayern
the fact that Joshua Kim@@ che was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup is no accident .
the FC Bayern anticip@@ ates a big season for the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner - extra motivation is not det@@ ri@@ mental .
something was different in its place in the cabin , that looked Joshua Kim@@ ol@@ ly immediately , even if the additional garment was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er could be seen , he simply put his hands on his arm .
&quot; the coach didn &apos;t announce it , &quot; said the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner afterwards , after his first deployment as Bavaria @-@ captain .
well , the stand could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C stack .
but Kim@@ che was able to interpret the character of the coach as well .
not the eight year old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a guide in the C @-@ El@@ f , who was born out of youth players , de@@ but@@ s and just out of the holiday , but he .
sugar is best distributed to those you want to do when you are in a good mood .
thus , those who have been chosen to enter the legacy of L@@ ah@@ m can only use a small extra motivation .
Kim@@ che confirmed : &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old was a mini @-@ l@@ ame about the field .
to the right rear , that &apos;s his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did the rest .
and at all Kim@@ che worked in this starting formation like the one who can take the helm in his hand .
he gave instructions trying to direct the un@@ trained tro@@ upe .
he had a look for the whole while many others were busy with themselves .
Vi@@ dal to re@@ play his missing fitness ( foldable barely ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches therefore decided to get out of the performance of the Asia @-@ trip ( fold even condi@@ tionally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le did not fall neg@@ atively in their first appearance in the Bayern Tri@@ k@@ ot .
all the same , it worked very well .
Sü@@ le was running along with Kim@@ che , Ru@@ dy in front of the def@@ ences , both acting sovereign .
the nam@@ es@@ ake @-@ occupied Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and in addition , Sü@@ le tried a few times successfully in the game @-@ building .
his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result was &quot; not as we had hoped for . &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; shifting the game , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was picked up for this style too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as unusual this Bayern world is still for the new entran@@ ces , one looked at the game following the match .
for example , Ru@@ dy did not give one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but determined six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ che said good@@ bye after a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements in his new te@@ amm@@ ate &apos;s back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard an interesting sentence from Sü@@ le : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win any game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new anymore .

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises kno@@ bs pace
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is reflected in more than a year when the new Minister for Economic Affairs Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V demand of a change in economic policy - and simultaneously blame the old ministers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Trier Companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing takes up the desires of the economy , which Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ us sees the biggest turning point in infrastructure policy : the gap between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
this year the ministry hopes for a planning process until 2021 is expected to be the right of construction .
the West Bank of Trier plays a role in the plans of the country as well , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Ro@@ of Traffic Plan .
the aim is to put the track into operation in December 2020 , says Minister Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees in it a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competing companies .
the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Trier is seeking a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports falling for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , the Chamber of Commerce lo@@ oses .
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier will provide an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new master bonus , says Managing Director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euros ear@@ marked for the master &apos;s exam and 2500 Euros will be provided , if graduates stay independent within ten years of their master &apos;s training .
the home@@ work list for the country stays long .
during the planned road construction , facts are quick to establish , at the same time out of the country the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , chief executive of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier .
from 56 new engineers , who want to employ bis@@ sing in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mobility , only 29 jobs have been occupied .
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
CD@@ U vice @-@ president Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf therefore refers to calculations by the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country has invested more than 20 million euros less in the receipt of country roads in 2017 and 2018 .
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country to solve the shortage of skilled labour in the region .
the broad@@ band expansion in the country is also so@@ ber@@ ing .
in 2016 regional companies had rated power supply in an I@@ HK @-@ survey only with Note 3,@@ 4 .
they compl@@ ained about stagn@@ ant Internet connections and break@@ through@@ s .
ex @-@ Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and still sits in the supervisory board of the wind turbine Pro Wind .
the Green faction left Lem@@ ke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe , where they cleared the field after four months due to discre@@ pan@@ cies .
Audi is expected to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter @-@ reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW claimed that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
the BMW chairman said that &quot; there are smar@@ ter options available as driving restrictions , &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or limit diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the enterprises described the under@@ tak@@ ings as recall .
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the cost of the car manufacturers to install equipment for neutr@@ al@@ ising exhaust f@@ umes from diesel vehicles also increases , making it difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of den@@ ying the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
the companies attempt to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called off @-@ off devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but return in normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were charged , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from ex@@ tradition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to b@@ ypass the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States was expanded .
the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes more than proportion@@ ately to the win of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los bulb n@@ oses and laughter against sorrow
Mor@@ di@@ llo was temporarily one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ on dra@@ fts@@ men , the bulb n@@ oses of his characters are his trademark .
also with 85 the Argent@@ inian still draws and works on a film .
his message : laughter , &quot; For there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he proposed among other things a dra@@ fts@@ man for greetings cards - which was frustr@@ ated by him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came to him at the end of the 1960s : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo characters cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning he still sits at the drawing table today , works almost ten hours a day .
over cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches , its dro@@ ll figures continue to spread worldwide .
he has been working on a carto@@ on and a TV series with his figures for six years .
the protagon@@ ist in the film &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los arbitrary animal in his drawings - who has a thous@@ and@@ ler as a counter@@ part .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film , which will come to the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they &apos;re saying , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
therefore , he rather relies on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without wor@@ rying .
la@@ ven@@ der threatened with climate change from Provence
he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened with climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is dec@@ lining because of the conditions caused by d@@ rought and because of diseases transmitted to scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , prepare great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute C@@ RI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years , which in the spring brought much less rain and in the autumn a lot more .
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small ci@@ ca@@ ine , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ des , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much in the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of having very long plant heads with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness .
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thur@@ in@@ gian border celebrates its 1200 years existence .
festival point is this Saturday and Sunday with a Medi@@ eval festival .
shop@@ keepers , guil@@ ds , traders , vag@@ ab@@ onds or a farm holiday camp should be able to experience these days in the city center .
the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet Wedn@@ es@@ days to check their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels more secure : they are supposed to take their children into the office , who were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies .
they ask the repor@@ ters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is needed , percep@@ tions and gut feelings reach .
there are drug traffi@@ ckers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists suspected of standing on the government &apos;s pay@@ roll or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there are no rest periods of violence , and as the cor@@ p@@ ses accum@@ ulate throughout the country , more and more journalists are in the process : at least 25 since President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to took office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are under federal protection after attacks and threats , and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year .
among the latter is the publisher and her inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his many books about violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep , although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two repor@@ ters in the 19@@ 30s , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts , which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared topics , the trauma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a Special Federal Prosecutor &apos;s Office was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , it has initiated only two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most of the thousands of kill@@ ings associated with drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime every year , the kill@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to justice .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a although they are in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and although the terrain is still more tra@@ it@@ eful .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little use , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we mix everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15 Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the state capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and was shot at him 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ fth River . &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius drove away in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and the ex@@ tradition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields in the country since rival fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a anyone or more people are shot on the streets every day or that the cemetery full of orn@@ ate , two @-@ st@@ ori@@ ed m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug addic@@ ts that are larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; when only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken by guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
first , in February there was the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ ene Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val@@ ing cart@@ el frac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , suspected aisle members bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was not to force Val@@ dez to leave the country for his own security following the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined Ri@@ odo@@ ce with five colleagues and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug poison problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the paper earned a reputation for cour@@ a@@ geous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
repor@@ ters loved to be able to publish highly accurate investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to handle .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot @-@ Prize &quot; for her coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history wherever it led .
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take over the task that you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What have you done in the face of so many dead ? why did you not say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Fe@@ odo@@ ce @-@ Team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the sp@@ aw@@ ning bird that could cur@@ b like a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table .
now they ask : was his love for routine destruction ?
his death also forced her to question her own ass@@ umptions about how best to do her job and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like dealing with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret start and landing ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the anger is , the editor of the Fe@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened with J@@ avier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - as not in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape is changing constantly .
in the space in which the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , no mobile phones were allowed . days before it became known that sp@@ y@@ ware , which is exclusively sold to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside two polic@@ emen were seeking shelter from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ size neighborhood of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
half in joke , some of the repor@@ ters questioned whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who had designated the governor themselves as un@@ trust@@ worthy .
it is months since the repor@@ ters have gone to the mountain landscape where the drug gangs are de facto under control .
for the edition of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has been embroi@@ dered on three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the ex @-@ known Box@@ ers Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an exposure to the state expendi@@ tures concentrated on the home town of the governor .
and there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block away from the office of the prosec@@ utor , conducting a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or what happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , who belonged to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) that dominated all the political levels almost the whole century .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ bre cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous incidents in this locality , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack .
only a few months earlier , readers of Val@@ dez would have considered the best informed source of kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to his slender body . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Val@@ dez office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the workers have become something they never expected themselves : activists in the name of the press .
repor@@ ter Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez grab@@ bed a few notes and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist in the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador N@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA testing that it is its .
journalists have become lou@@ der all over the country by de@@ compos@@ ing in organised protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on pav@@ ements and buildings .
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying on journalists and killing them because they said the truth .
she has since asked her to be sub@@ divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , government officials and a indiffer@@ ent society .
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces , who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; media group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and civil servants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez .
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as cart@@ el : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones were placed next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue as the El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of its director in 2004 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben E@@ spin@@ osa , who , together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City , was murdered three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , admitted that drug traffi@@ cking frigh@@ tened him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I became repor@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and d@@ rank beer , when all their phones began to bu@@ zz .
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with riv@@ ets and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan bathing resort had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continues to escal@@ ate as promised by a number of Kartell &apos;s messages in the region .
from the cur@@ b edge they published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens are how@@ ling nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who held guard to see if they were ready .
if they were sc@@ ared at all , they did not show it .
under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his foot@@ steps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just think about closing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If on the same day , when J@@ avier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Din@@ osau@@ r used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to ev@@ ade its enemies
at first glance , it looks like a statue , al@@ beit a frigh@@ tening one .
researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the incredible r@@ hin@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian min@@ er were so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa der Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was so well received that they could even see that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said she had had something of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; troubled past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whis@@ per@@ ing din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r specimens in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of the cycle time between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well preserved condition has ast@@ o@@ unded researchers who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot;
according to National Ge@@ ographic reports , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es are the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , on March 21 , 2011 at the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
he met something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to expose the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy earth @-@ lum@@ ps .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you blin@@ dly smile with your eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found that these her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although covered with arm@@ or and resem@@ ble a changing tank , are probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the strongly arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique that is known as a counter @-@ sh@@ ading that is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed it to get better in its surroundings and to ev@@ ade its enemies , experts say , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now available at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and named Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta Mark@@ ab@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team who has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to discover it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
they discovered the sh@@ ady , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was dark@@ er than its under@@ side .
although the shade @-@ shade is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds that of today living animals .
it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by din@@ osau@@ rs fed by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution fav@@ ored the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use counter sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or sh@@ ing@@ les - are much smaller and vulnerable to prey , which indicates that this no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs have to have been the cra@@ ck@@ down time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to study the animal for clu@@ es about his life , including his con@@ served intest@@ ine , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sun@@ k on his back to the bottom of the sea .
at this time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as Süd@@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ is@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved fl@@ ak@@ y skin , but remains intact in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early cycle time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just squ@@ int a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is sleeping . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge ther@@ op@@ ods , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons heavy monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta died in the sea after death and was m@@ um@@ mi@@ fied in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , on March 21 , 2011 at the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
according to the museum , it is the best @-@ preserved pet@@ ri@@ fied din@@ osau@@ r in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from mu@@ zzle to hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips , which hung from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were swe@@ pt through the western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the underwater equipment of the din@@ osau@@ r kept its arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the house @-@ list still lay b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a lot@@ tery profit .
the more I look at it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right foot rests on his side , his five fingers are spread upward .
I can count the scales at his sole &apos; .
in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many wounded
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , miles long St@@ aus and G@@ aff@@ er .
around 20 people were injured on the Stuttgart @-@ Munich Highway ( A8 ) on Thursday afternoon .
according to the first data of the police , between the connection points Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) , almost 30 vehicles , among them probably trucks , crashed into each other during a thunder@@ storm .
at first there were no details of the exact number of injured persons .
it was a matter of light to moderate injuries , said a police spokes@@ man .
a great ban on rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of travel in Munich , a ten @-@ kilomet@@ re @-@ long back@@ log was formed .
as an A@@ Z repor@@ ter reports , it also came on the opposite road to massive disabilities - through numerous aff@@ ers .
the fire department noted the characteristics of the vehicle operators , who now have to expect sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a car .
a rescue helicopter was on the road to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : nothing susp@@ end sitting in the train and sleeping .
or one is deep@@ ening in his work and has just a brilliant idea .
and then : buff@@ alo .
the conductor comes and w@@ akes an un@@ gentle or ri@@ pping the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the paper@@ less ticket control .
you simply confirm by phone that you take your place and vali@@ date the ticket .
currently , a test operation is running on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come the offer , we extend it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be available at many other long distance routes in Germany in the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the name of the train without a conductor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use it , however , some requirements need to be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers are doing anyway .
it is also necessary to have bought it via the app of the train , the DB Navigator , which is anyway the most convenient way of booking .
and last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like this : one climb@@ s into the train , calls his ticket to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a button for electronic de@@ valuation appears at the test customers .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
when the train atten@@ dant arrives at ticket inspection in place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with an already paid online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , continue working , keep silent .
the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers .
&quot; if you want to travel relaxed without ti@@ ck@@ eting through our train atten@@ dant , please check out the DB Navigator itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB &apos;s marketing management board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often run trains know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket controls are among the biggest offen@@ ders .
because often you have , in any case , one of the fellow travelers not all the documents you need for the de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document you have to show .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ dant and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling your own ticket and the conductor will take the time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can still use the new service .
and this also applies to ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same route are not yet available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Britt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was shocked to its core .
only one day after she arrived in New York City , she was sitting in St. Louis building on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled over a post from someone from High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old child and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , because no one else posted the information on her feed , she closed on Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly res@@ cu@@ ed at their tim@@ eline .
the R@@ apper from the area of St. Louis was , the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed , live to twe@@ eter .
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretched out on the street and stayed there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she put her cell phone off to return to twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field drive later in the evening .
there were photos of the police band and people shou@@ ting , and from a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns &apos;s father who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed in which a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another polic@@ eman sh@@ ook his gun and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l reminded himself of her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the type of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment , I felt ch@@ ills .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and cried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock she fet@@ ched her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the subject of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cin@@ emas from the 11th .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resili@@ ence that exists from the point of view of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel@@ l came to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a matching crown , the two had a conversation , which they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people need to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on now because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t take it with me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it must know it and see it and be educated in it .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organisation , but also the different layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we have to do to become free to free ourselves .
although I am fortunate enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience any bl@@ at@@ ant rac@@ ism , she is no different from the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would be doing a bad service to keep it away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on was located at the South of Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp site when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my activ@@ ism has changed totally after August 9th , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has all come . &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rel@@ l met during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film directors of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman , Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r only wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came to Fer@@ rel@@ l in mind : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by inn@@ um@@ erable cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that prof@@ ited from their pain and their ability to resist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that people born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on did not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ jo@@ ct prisoners .
his commitment brought the project closer to Fer@@ rel@@ l , along with six other local people followed the team of Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns shooting .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; Davis said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are portra@@ yed , for this is how I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ara &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a Messiah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Tor@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most open participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; consequently , documents of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ara &apos;s life , as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , laugh@@ ing when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ isation of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ferr@@ ara &apos;s story also repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the broader Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions carried the movement overall , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement really is held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Fer@@ rel@@ l was selected as the heart of the film because of her identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who vibr@@ ated this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no accident , although it was on the front line because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black gay woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can sense their energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have disappeared long ago , but the ra@@ cial connections between the municipality and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
yet she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss about bit gallery
the bit gallery moves people , although it is not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the southern end of the pedestrian prec@@ inct spl@@ its the population in pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
the subject hardly leaves one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some say to the bit gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; That &apos;s really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need a man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ahn ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while the advoc@@ ates build that a gallery attracts more customers into the city , of which the rest of the shops also benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the plot in which the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
it will be concluded with the beginning of the construction work .
the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Bed@@ a Square with possibility to sit outside .
Sim@@ one Room : &quot; for many years we have been buying in the farmer &apos;s market almost every week .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the rural women are happy again and again .
we also discovered the but@@ ch@@ ery for us .
we would like to see that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
there are also other cities .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing is located in a market hall in the gallery , the amount of rent applies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but that might not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what shopping bag in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I think that is superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is already enough of this in our city .
one can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains at our disposal .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive at the top .
as you can see , shop outlets are rented in a shopping centre only by larger firms , because the r@@ ents there are often not portable for a retail@@ er .
too bad , special transactions are almost no longer available and that which is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a shopping m@@ all with a market hall does not fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the peasant market hall live during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes at some point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or does the spec@@ ter bit gallery already manage to drive all business from Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; George Mar@@ quet : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it just won &apos;t work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and a shopping centre , which stands empty , no one needs .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery .
but for a farmers market hall there is no more space thanks to the incredibly many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg .
when the farmers market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching resem@@ b@@ lance : artist creates portraits featuring Chelsea Mann@@ ing &apos;s DNA
in the middle of the room at the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are to be seen - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent out the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth where the former secret service analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after she publicly filed diplomatic reports on Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on August 2nd is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( A matching resem@@ b@@ lance ) .
she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline combined her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and pioneering dissi@@ dent , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .
through the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA extracted from Mann@@ ing , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg developed a sharp , though somewhat intellectual commentary not only to the forms of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also created to identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convic@@ ted of 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
her picture was supp@@ ressed through the prison , so much that there was only one photo - a gran@@ ular , black @-@ and @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing is visi@@ bly uncomfortable on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg had just emerged from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts such as cigarette but@@ ts and ch@@ ewing gum by extrac@@ ting DNA from waste to make a picture of how these people might look .
that was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated m@@ use have become un@@ equal ne@@ ph@@ ew that exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
they even created a com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ah Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future in which President Chel@@ Over@@ seas verdict would convert and she would be able to personally see the exhibition .
that Obama actually took only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome kind of happy encounter .
there is also now something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , since Donald Tr@@ ump carries out a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops in order to find new twe@@ et@@ able ways to continue the rigid divisions that he should actually trou@@ bl@@ esh@@ oot .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery Mann@@ ing called for an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , &quot; based on gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ th of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , by incorporating the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , hoped to show how amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in a biological point of view , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully take with you is that our gen@@ ome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned com@@ ic @-@ nov@@ ella .
it shows Mann@@ ing how she appears with a free speech phone in the hand from the bar@@ racks of the United States like King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they make your speech , they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who greeted me from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the show personally - just as it was anticipated in the com@@ ic book - but if she should do it , she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ os , which are gathered like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , up to size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , in which her genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , I had her on the wall , but I wanted her to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that also stuck behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University for killing
a nationwide man hunt is underway for a professor at the Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University who were looked for as susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious Chicago apartment .
on Monday W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) were issued arrest warran@@ ts for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the files of the Local Court of Cook County showed .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au died , 26 , after several stit@@ ches .
a common warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the cor@@ p@@ se was discovered on 27 July .
officials got a call , arrived at Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still dead at the scene of the event , and det@@ ec@@ tives investigate the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively seeking the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
since 2007 she has been Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at the Nor@@ th@@ western University .
Alan K. Cu@@ b@@ garbage , vice president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail explanation that he has now been in judgement and excluded from entering the Campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cu@@ b@@ garbage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker from the University and the Somer@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail explanation that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the UK police and are ready to help US investig@@ ators in any way possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to be .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly ur@@ ges the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them reinforce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip , who said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27th .
it was confirmed by security cameras that they were in the building .
&quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management team at Grand Plaza has published an explanation for the residents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the victim &apos;s background and expl@@ ores a variety of motives , including a possible home incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA Road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the Russian vice @-@ president Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA schedule has been updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of WA@@ DA &apos;s road@@ map to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re@@ introducing R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything was announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the criteria listed in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the WA@@ DA by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of the matter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we conduct the investigation because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has got an error . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programmes , and we won &apos;t give anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ ko &apos;s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales office r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v gave rise to problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condi@@ tionally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia in November 2015 in the wake of the dop@@ ing sc@@ andal .
it was however allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
following a visit to the Moscow headquarters in July , WA@@ DA Director General Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moved &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di sold no eggs for the time being
the company groups shared this with them .
it was a mere precau@@ tion that could not be prec@@ eded by any health impairment , it was said in the message .
from now on only eggs can be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been proven to have been tested neg@@ atively on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ ateral anti @-@ lice .
Al@@ di aims to provide clarity and transparency to its customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company do not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your employees at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys didn &apos;t work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed .
she called for help from outside .
a new breed of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is on the guard to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to address surveys , provide special groups and demographic groups , employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow the C @-@ Suite executives to b@@ ypass and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , Co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Mr Er@@ ret@@ t said she has a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t won .
in addition to the snap @-@ surveys and surveys of specific teams , it provides a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low approval results - so that you can re@@ boot why .
companies are expected to remain at the top of the workplace culture , so that you won &apos;t be the next rob@@ ber involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee published a blog post that describes an environment of nu@@ is@@ ance in which those who have spoken are punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this desire for an overview is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
the global governance , regulation , and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , according to the Financial Technical web site Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ all in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
convertible has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
the client recently signed up as a client .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent lets companies send customized &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surveys , gather confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also provides an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that allows employees to report bad behavior .
and if the Chief Executive Officer is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and CEO of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company is found that treats its employees poorly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences by consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , has appointed Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
sooner , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e @-@ mail for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a intim@@ id@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees .
now , as the company employs Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that have previously been hidden by executives who have been sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair inter@@ ns - can be identified and addressed more quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the Risk Management Group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment li@@ tigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ es Engagement in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies recognized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and burden the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that finds the approval of Venture Capital investors , who have supported both start @-@ ups .
Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of firms like S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the entire capital was raised to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought his total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only st@@ akes .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that &apos;s worth their votes and that the work you do is worth it , they feel more strongly committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , who uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors can achieve returns if their portfolio companies are well running . companies run well when employees are committed and committed .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase engagement and commitment of the staff , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee involvement according to the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action .
in fact , if a company asks staff according to your feedback , it can have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , this can grow disappointment and demo@@ tiv@@ ate employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ask for 4,000 comments , you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the business management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies who have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow , staff ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so saving .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees it was through the speed of decision making and the quality of communication , able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always receives new insights into employees , and it hopes that in the long run this leads to a better relationship between employees in a sector known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers then you will lose business .
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock , when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers conver@@ se on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some have pulled out their tri@@ cot pieces and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these un @-@ violent minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are en@@ rolled at the summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three hour exercise before returning to the Wasser@@ man Football Centre next morning at 6 : 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the boys next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday was on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ligh@@ ten the load of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore the first three sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 7 : 15 p.m. to meet the already packed schedule of the players .
the compromise between the two days is more than a day at which the fry postpon@@ ed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing times in West@@ wood practi@@ sed practical exercises .
they are supposed to hold 18 exercises in August . 20 before the beginning of the formal game preparations for their kick @-@ off against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said he supports the change in rules of the N@@ CA@@ A even if they add another point to the many busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they plac@@ ate on , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think once we get to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practice once the camp is finished , which is due to the clear lines of its fields of an adjacent car park and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class , which has already cleared with foot@@ balls , which will be a protection grid behind a gate @-@ post , no easy task will be .
Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then set up there to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
so I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts verification in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to fake testim@@ oni@@ als from third parties and then show their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated mechanical learning methods to detect possible false noti@@ fications and to send them to fac@@ tual sur@@ charges that may display results of the fact test from the original article .
Facebook was den@@ ounced as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake @-@ news , many of whom believe that they also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters being floo@@ ded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to be punished after social media networks if they do not succeed in quickly eradic@@ ating hat@@ eful in@@ scrip@@ tions as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook told in a separate statement in German that a test of new facts will be launched in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to finding out which stories are challenged by fac@@ tional opponents of third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook continues to feature its feature on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and works on other changes to his news feed to reduce wrong messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 &apos;s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy sitting at the River Tal in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ed Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s so nice to look at someone &apos;s hand@@ writing that has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; covers the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wi@@ cz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote &quot; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &quot; in 2014 , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only re@@ acted to the thumb print on the page of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700 &quot; s that worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell of smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself was there .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome greeting &quot; ) seems to be all too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he wander@@ ed through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape donations , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he d@@ rank whis@@ key and started to write . &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received full access until 2006 when the last hei@@ ress , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the cler@@ ks just started to look after the archive that he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristoc@@ rats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the loft . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , maps showing who possessed something : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families .
guys , let everything go its way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se on a broader base in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; following a man who leaves the newly built castle in order to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &quot; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex , &quot; Rho@@ des says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising started in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it Father , whom the Dar@@ rel@@ l family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l portra@@ yed his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was only made years later when his coff@@ in was dug out ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gent@@ lemen seemed to be quite Ga@@ un@@ er , always pay debts and spend money for things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ men solved their debt crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to advertise revenue . &quot;
after the end of his use in the castle , Rho@@ des is looking for other unique writing experiences
he spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about E@@ lä@@ mä@@ ki , the site of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was sad to go back again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle v@@ eils in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the closure of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team headed by Nelson Ar@@ tz want to keep the logo and slogan secret until Thursday .
at the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too beautiful for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers of the action have been asking for the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think this ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote on her website that was released yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
in fact , we firmly believe that as a Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer , we are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the event , more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it goes on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ inclusive promise , one that gives the city a unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , they stand in competition with other communities .
the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will cost an average five @-@ digit amount for its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
each year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) disc@@ usses retirement and promotion in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first sight a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as in the past , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
the five Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs were also part of the deliber@@ ations .
in this way , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the over@@ population .
the government re@@ treats the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff of Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were dismissed .
since the coup failed , head of state Erdo@@ gan 169 has fired the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged links to the movement of the Ex@@ ile Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erdo@@ gan as the wi@@ re@@ head of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people who allegedly participated directly in the coup attempt will be negotiated in Ankara since that week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the coup attempt as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God &apos;s gift &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely clean &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really get the army under control ?
at the end of February , the paper Hür@@ ri@@ yet published an article with the head@@ line &quot; discomfort in the military headquarters . &quot;
there are concerns in the general staff because of an increasing &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the aboli@@ tion of the prohibition of he@@ aders for soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
in any case , the grand pur@@ ge in the army and the security forces continues .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan released another 7@@ 3@@ 95 coup leaders , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as though Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als used to be the masters of the country earlier than the actual lords of the country .
three times they called on their role as the guar@@ dians of the secular state .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pressed the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform objectives of the European Union .
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is driving a targeted fight against Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a particularly un@@ named officer warned that after the coup attempt to seek persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this is true , such a development could not leave NATO indiffer@@ ent .
in any case , there is doubt in the alliance after the pur@@ ges that the Turkish army is ready to deplo@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say Nato &apos;s diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted by the media .
it envis@@ ages reducing the legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter rules on obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permits and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do so by changing the way citizens from other countries will be spent on Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate circuit for race shuttle
over the past few months , the future of the race shuttle has been cont@@ ested - now it is going to be quite fast .
before the end of the year , it is time to build on the ailing road on which the tourist train is going .
in order to secure the future of the race sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , construction work on the track should begin this year , according to the Ministry of Transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate the Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g track , the country is committed to this important connection , especially for tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Minister of Transport Klaus At@@ on@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the repair of the route were reduced to about 2.5 million euros .
from that sum , the country takes 75 percent .
the contract , on whose basis the shuttle is to be ordered also in the future of the country , is currently defini@@ tively agreed , explained expi@@ ation .
the Ministry and the Southern Thur@@ in@@ gia are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pun@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
as a result , the race track shuttle should be ordered on a regular basis in December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle is a popular rail link between the stations of Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g , especially among tourists .
over the past few months , during a pilot operation , it has been tested whether the route is used by a large number of people to order them again in the future .
the track is also in parts strongly b@@ anded .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry about it
just as you thought that it can &apos;t become more crazy in 2017 , a new report comes about the technological developments in the area of sex robots .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a great thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robo@@ tics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Emer@@ itus Professor of Robo@@ tics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must begin to take their ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it and we &apos;ll see them much more often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey when publishing his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex d@@ olls have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adapt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything from the eye color of the robot via the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it becomes even more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; who would look a step@@ per woman progres@@ sively .
modern sex d@@ olls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin .
for example , the Real@@ Bo@@ ti@@ x robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed person@@ ages like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which conve@@ ys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; adv@@ entu@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as much as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enth@@ uses the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day , she also has her mo@@ ods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; it can be tired , fixed on conversation or it can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent female characteristics , the all@@ u@@ sions to rape , when one takes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means : reluc@@ tant ) Far@@ rah , distur@@ b one the most .
featured on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can &apos;t men have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just a different sex toy .
their emergence and their increasing refin@@ ement point to something dark and deeper in our culture , to a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with subj@@ ection as optional en@@ core .
most men will of course not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notices their increasing popularity , they nevertheless remain at the br@@ ink of consumer culture .
but what tran@@ spir@@ es from the boundary zones can be very instruc@@ tive in relation to the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not wei@@ rd or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when women &apos;s rights are threatened around the world in which there is a president in the White House who has been bo@@ asting women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted .
the most dre@@ ad@@ ful aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the intri@@ cate body and the ex@@ tin@@ ct eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( even with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their gro@@ wers want them to feel human@@ ely that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , taken to the point when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no communication or background story , nothing that hin@@ ders independence or anything that could interfere with the imagination of total submission .
in other words , they are false slaves .
or to express it in the Spe@@ aking of 2017 : ma@@ ids
Tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of a healthy human mind
it became a tru@@ ism of the Tr@@ ump Er@@ a that the political divisions that pol@@ arized the US elec@@ torate have also split families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers with advice in the US about how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ selecting relatives .
we are all supposed to strain all of us to burst our filter bags .
less noticed is the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps to bring together families .
I mention this because my cous@@ in , a left @-@ minded poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republi@@ cans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
it reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the republi@@ can relationship with which she strug@@ gl@@ ed for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side .
it is certainly a good thing around the dining table , but it is important to me that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the dis@@ figur@@ ing effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right .
when we speak of &quot; normal@@ isation &quot; and &quot; Tr@@ ump , &quot; we refer to the sp@@ ook@@ y possibility that his k@@ itt@@ ens will not be exp@@ elled one day .
there is , however , an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump Republi@@ cans of the right wing are &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison with its standards .
today I find myself surrounded by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the mad@@ man - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact occur as a very mild criminal off@@ ence .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Republi@@ cans must be mentally healthy to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York park department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are enormously large , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are kn@@ ur@@ led and the animals twist to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the per@@ pen@@ di@@ cular music conve@@ ys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite across the day when I found out that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the theme @-@ pub ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not counting - but a big round@@ about in the north of London .
the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magic experience , since here two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women can go on it in the 40 &quot; s and all have a great time .
if I could have evaluated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to pay the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required .
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ tic , while I was tired of making my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain removed from prison to hospital
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year , he was taken to the hospital because of the treatment of s@@ lei@@ ghs and suffered the prison authorities in his cell after a fall .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence because of murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by firing it several times through a door of the toilet cab in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us said he kept his girlfriend for a noc@@ tur@@ nal intru@@ der who hid in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time to the six @-@ year custo@@ dial sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us Appe@@ al , from which they say that it is too transparent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the national law enforcement agency said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal can be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is at risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the schools in Blum@@ berg , the four @-@ year @-@ depend@@ ants were dischar@@ ged from F@@ emen and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen to the holidays and to the secondary schools .
three of the pupils will go to the secondary school in the future , four at the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening school director An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
as a symbol for school dis@@ mis@@ sal , the 29 students of the four classes chose a young eagle , who grew up in the chicken farm , but then released to freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the m@@ lower band performed a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the Chi@@ cken Farm &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it hat@@ ch from his chi@@ ckens .
instead of chi@@ ckens , a little eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of him broke , and the eagle disper@@ sed his wings on a high mountain , and s@@ wore .
then the classes showed three and four in the rehear@@ sing of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln , who bore the cylinders to the bet .
the Eagle stands for integration , said school director An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te .
the young is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belonged to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
she desired every quarter to feel accepted in his new school .
there was a word of thanks to the colleagues , former school manager Michael Müller , who always jumps with instruc@@ tive bott@@ len@@ ecks , and the parents &apos; representatives .
the kitchen time is over now , class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher explained .
they did not leave their students after two years of instruction only very reluc@@ t@@ antly because it was a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the four @-@ quarters .
finally , all students left a song of summer time and holiday time .
there was great joy in the children .
eight first @-@ time students have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were det@@ ained for illegal camps in Greece , announced the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television .
on the morning of 1 August , a group of illeg@@ ally camp people was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , among them both Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released while an investigation is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened the control over the free camping and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , substantial fin@@ es .
controls are continued throughout the season .
the Ministry said that the Court may impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what those affected now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel peak , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they are intended to improve the emissions behaviour of emissions classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are exemp@@ ted from this .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin from the ACE Car Club Europa gives assessments :
is the new action compulsory ?
no , the negotiated software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the obligatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have Schumann &apos;s software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has arranged the Federal Office of the Forces ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the coming months , but have not yet been called an exact date .
Daimler advised to write to every person affected .
if an inspection is due anyway , this will be done within the scope of the inspection .
how long will the retro@@ fitting take place altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
this depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen that the autom@@ akers act voluntarily on the subject of the environment up to now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
it could be more time @-@ consuming to get an appointment .
what do drivers that do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ?
the ACE advises to wait .
foreign manufacturers would probably reti@@ re , such as S@@ met@@ anin .
is there a threat of a massive price deterioration of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE is afraid of that .
but in the regions where driving prohi@@ bitions thre@@ aten .
in rural areas , there is currently no loss of value for older diesel engines .
the ACE advises to wait for a sale .
ll Cool J Rec@@ ei@@ ves Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving under President Tr@@ ump promises to become political .
one of the lau@@ re@@ ates does not want to come - in protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted prizes from the renowned Kennedy Center .
as the cultural institution was announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) are among the honored .
the awards will be presented at the beginning of December .
traditionally US President Donald Tr@@ ump will host a reception and take part in the award together with his wife Mel@@ ania .
the award winner Le@@ ar , which has been announced with progressive TV series , has already announced that he would give up participation in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to completely negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ve them of the means - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to make her point of view clear . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kennedy @-@ Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
the earlier winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will reti@@ re next year .
the position is already written out - but suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been a city builder for 31 years .
and the work is still great fun for him as he communic@@ ates in the press conference .
he reports from varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his followers .
at the same time , it is surprising that so far no application will fulfil the requirements profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
so - taking notice of the regular periods of notice - should be enough time for a famili@@ arization .
since Has@@ lach works as an auxiliary building authority for the administrative community , the applicant must provide appropriate conclusions .
for this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if they could no longer fill them , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for consultation .
but clos@@ eness to the citizens is important to the city and itself , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate and a good mood among the authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , looking back at the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city life worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the Bau@@ amt and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen parking lot approximately are encountered .
the zig@@ z@@ ag bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium renovation is still a topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter will make a book with about 1.5 million Euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my success@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
for a city bau@@ d there is great scope for design .
with Has@@ la@@ chs &apos;s own yard and nur@@ sery , many things can be re@@ acted flexibly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Old Town as an ensemble is under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye on what fits in &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going urban master builder emphasizes .
anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has a great responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything runs here over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been doing so for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) has been working for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even that his successor stays long , W@@ acker wants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further development of the city .
those who want to bury Roland W@@ acker should have studied architecture as a diploma engineer or a bach@@ elor &apos;s degree in architecture according to the city of Has@@ lach and have good technical knowledge in the fields of building planning and planning permission .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt ( Stadt@@ bau@@ amt ) is subject to civil and civil engineering , construction planning , property management , municipal property management , urban farm with building yard and municipal gardening , as well as the Lower Building Law Office including monument protection .
bicycle thrown on lines : South lane blocked
according to the police , the perpet@@ rators , previously unknown , threw the blue bike from the rail@@ road crossing in the area of the Le@@ oben road ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpet@@ rators and have been searching for them since the night hours .
close to the scene there were witnessed by witnesses a sco@@ oter and a bike rider .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ itzer stroke , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ r@@ ator , or the perpet@@ r@@ ator , would have put himself in great danger and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the installation , as well as the delay and the costs of the rail freight traffic , the railway customers could also get to the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; overall , there was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the South railway line could be brought without disabilities .
there were barely ten passenger trains on Friday morning , two of which concerned the long @-@ distance traffic .
freight trains were not cancelled , but they were delayed .
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch about 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate may help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study says exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the incur@@ able state , which affects about 1.3 million in the US and 300@@ ,000 in the United States , causes stomach cr@@ amps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme ti@@ redness .
while the suffer@@ ers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant gut .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the gut pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes hiding in the food do not penetrate the body .
cells able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging delicate tissues .
if the equilibrium tends too far in the direction of inflammation , an inflammatory bow@@ el disease can result from this .
experiments have shown that a kind of tolerance stimulates the immune cell in mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a bacteria species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han encourages more toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ lie@@ us , if the same system works among men .
the post @-@ doctoral researcher Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance than it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe that had been separated , but had not .
they assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ omes of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the mice &apos;s intest@@ ines were DNA @-@ sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species were found that were present in mice with the immune cells , but without the mice lacking them .
mice were wound up in a sterile environment , so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they were given the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria worked on the immune system , the researchers led L. reu@@ ter@@ i to grow in a liquid and then conducted small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism known as i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that humans have the same toler@@ ant cells such as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts protect .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans like in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values can lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; to N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
at Manchester United , with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic sign a &quot; genius , &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ dam@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday , and impres@@ sing in the owner &apos;s role when people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira preferred to march at will .
however , matic was excluded from the pre @-@ prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot;
besides M@@ atic also Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u started in the Avi@@ va Stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho made his start @-@ taxi for the beginning of the season .
the Independent un@@ veiled this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted three more new commitments , but insist@@ ed that the club already had a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfill three of its four primary commitments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three out of four , I thank the club for that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have made great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle to Washington State , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Mich@@ igan and retired in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens , the shape of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turns out : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel still was the SPD boss , Social Democratic ministers always looked after Berlin with a certain concern .
only no fire from the party headquarters , but no counter@@ wind from the Con@@ federation , was the most important wish of the election fighters .
since Martin Schulz led the party , this has changed fundamentally .
since then , the staff of the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus have observed with increasing horror the events in the SPD @-@ governed provincial capitals .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with head@@ winds .
there were failures .
and one by one .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against the coalition of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green simply cannot rule well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising fac@@ et of a Green Party de@@ pu@@ ties has pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the Parliament election , its red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ German managing director Michael Kell@@ ner has called on the back@@ sliding Lower Saxony green MP El@@ ke T@@ jackets to return their mandate .
the over@@ stepping of the CD@@ U signi@@ fies a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ jackets must immediately return their mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal Managing Director and election campaign manager of the Gre@@ ens Editorial Network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD election campaig@@ ner si@@ ghs when the new job message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , the SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is facing the CD@@ U without his own government majority following the transition of the green MP El@@ ke T@@ jackets .
it is the preliminary cul@@ mination of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD national associations .
and no one knows what &apos;s next .
the misery began with the unexpected clear defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , more not , was re@@ ass@@ uring at the time of the comrades .
everything will be different following the state elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia .
that was it - and everything got much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into w@@ af@@ ers , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te ble@@ w the party off smoothly .
the comrades lab@@ ori@@ ously rest@@ led in the weeks afterwards .
then , when they had just plu@@ cked up new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him came the next draft .
mayor O@@ la@@ f Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD landing head , lost his Nim@@ bus this weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because in crisis communication he made quite everything wrong with what one can do wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz has been fighting for his political survival .
so now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has already been in criticism for a long time because of the VW @-@ exhaust @-@ form and its role in the Supervisory Board .
mi@@ ese survey values were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of this , Wei@@ l has always tried to set accents in the federal government in the past few weeks .
the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin did not remain concealed either in the context of Martin Schulz .
they allowed him to be granted , because they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party from Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could occur .
in this regard , Wei@@ l is no blame for the party @-@ internal compul@@ sion of the Lower Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens .
and Schulz is not at all .
at the moment , comrades , therefore , endeav@@ our to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and above all to the apost@@ ate parliam@@ ent@@ arians T@@ westen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ westen combined her own career interests over the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ westen was not elected as a direct candidate because of her person , but on the state list of the Lower Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens in parliament , so the Lower Sax@@ on de@@ pu@@ ties .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compl@@ ains of an &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the choice of voters four years ago was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people have made Stephan Wei@@ l as prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who is leading the Lower Saxony SPD as a leading candidate in the election of the Bundestag , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for the clari@@ fication of the background .
I want to know if there have been more or further commitments of the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
funding for centre III
those who want to rehabil@@ itate his coming home can soon get support from the country .
mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representative St@@ eg city development informed about this on Wednesday in sens@@ ations .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler once again gave a review of what happened so far .
since 1991 it has been operating in sensitive areas of refur@@ bish@@ ment .
at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the State of Baden @-@ Württemberg bought two thirds of the subsi@@ dy amount .
in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - finally , it is important to promote interior development and not only to open up new areas of construction .
on 4 April we received the information from the Government Pres@@ idency of Karlsruhe that there will be a rehabilitation area III .
the subsi@@ dy amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which 500 000 Euros would come from the country , the rest of the community felt .
how does a rehabilitation area develop ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; one will continue to investigate , as Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role if interest exists in the planned area at all .
if necessary , the regional boundaries could also be postpon@@ ed again .
on Wednesday evening , the bar represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal state programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the restoration would be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
core of the programme is re@@ vit@@ alization of inner cities , improving living conditions and maintaining and expanding infrastructure .
the measures would be made object @-@ related , that is per property .
the rehabilitation area would then finally be defined as a by@@ laws .
the licensing period for funding runs since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
until September this year , however , the survey would be carried out only once , as part of which the participants involved in the rehabilitation area receive a questionnaire for filling out .
in November or December , the decree is to take place as far as possible , so that in the coming year the re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings can begin .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently declared that every municipality had to carry out the said preliminary investigations .
it is about evaluating the problems of urban development and deciding when to rehabil@@ itate and to which extent .
there will also be a re@@ mark in the land register for the respective plot .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come to sens@@ ations and make a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel emphasized that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
this is why questionn@@ aires will be sent to citizens in the weeks to come and be filled out by the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which it is possible , among other things , about the structural condition and the rehabilitation panorama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bud@@ get@@ ary and H@@ ousing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; data on size , distribution and residents of a residential area can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; business arc &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be filled only if business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , God pointed out that a completed questionnaire was not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler also emphas@@ ised that the distribution of the subsidies func@@ tioned according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; - who first comes first , grin@@ ds first .
you can &apos;t reserve any funding for later . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; village core II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown in order to make the present a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or uses a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in house and car
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through its Bio@@ Te@@ q company .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist in the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ant , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock .

the ship@@ post of the White House costs the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a nav@@ al helicopter to South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American production in the last month will cost tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military &apos;s information left to the TI@@ ME magazine up to $ 24@@ ,000 .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice @-@ President Mike P@@ ence and senior official of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the helicopter made in Connec@@ tic@@ ut was shown next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a Wisconsin fire@@ fighter car and a forklift from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a question@@ able order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 wrote on the eve of the event his superi@@ ors , the deputy nav@@ al commander for aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message showed that the helicopter arrived at the South La@@ wn on July 17th at about 3 o &apos;clock in the morning and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed , a second crew for the return flight would be required due to the limitation of the service hours .
the original flight crew was during the event at the helicopter while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane .
from the recordings provided by the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was required .
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal workers to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could viol@@ ate the provision .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a breach of the H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; the commander wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you were locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the President gave an imp@@ etus for reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon for politically beneficial purposes .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but to request their use only for a photo op is unusual .
Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation in February when the presidential plane was in front of the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential plane through its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is delighted with the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the White House Vice President , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often conduct training flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn to deplo@@ y the US president in the White House with precise centimet@@ res .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 course land@@ ings in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted on the training requirements of the crew &apos;s crew for the month , said one official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours on that day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers took the burden of none of the other pro@@ ps that were presented at the event .
a Si@@ kor@@ sky speaker said that the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget records for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ arians of the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , however , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour .
records of Un@@ ity list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include the costs of personnel , but also account for the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract completion .
at that time , the White House press spokesperson , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things that are made in America this week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the State of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people depend on it .
and I think most Americans are all proud of helicop@@ ters and other military equipment , for whom so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , it is appropriate to highlight this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicopter as he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire truck .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ cky task
fron@@ tr@@ un@@ ner of the Second Tennis Bundes@@ liga takes place at the table third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
the TC Blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss joins the table third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel .
despite the five games still flaw@@ less , the leader of the Second Tennis Bundes@@ liga survived the sense of reality .
team leader Mari@@ us Z@@ ay at any rate has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially at the rear positions I find the team very good . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V mainly imports from the high North are concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to bet@@ s in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be hard for us as always . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good portion of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser squ@@ ad for the trip to the high North is practical .

how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump did not really feel happy when he put his signature on Wednesday evening under the law to tigh@@ ten the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress packed some &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and Brussels itself was ashamed of US imp@@ etus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft stipul@@ ates that European companies can punish those who help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors of the Austrian O@@ MV , who co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Nord Stream 2 together with other European companies , have been al@@ armed .
the threat of dr@@ one is enormous .
nevertheless , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , such is the official statement of the oil corporation .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to raise the sanctions even by executive order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looked at which the group could ward off and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Staff@@ el 3 trailer : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is moved to the centre of the Net@@ fli@@ x series
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , which reveals Pablo &apos;s Es@@ co@@ bars K@@ iller , Net@@ fli@@ x &apos;s series is far from over .
the seasons three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest bu@@ cks of the show .
with the third season , the DE@@ A has focused its attention on the rich@@ est organization of drug traffi@@ cking in the world : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kartell .
led by four powerful god@@ parents , &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 Company , &quot; they operate only with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .

roll backwards : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ lunch table again .
with solid contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the city nur@@ series the clock is turned back .
on the 1st of September , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the city nur@@ sery facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again in self @-@ control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is still boiled out of house : a cat@@ erer under@@ takes this task and delivers fresh vinegar cooled .
the city operates 46 kinder@@ gar@@ tens in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 children get a hot meal at lunch@@ time .
in the past year of Kit@@ a@@ dem 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are cared for at least 45 hours of the week eat lunch at the centre of the day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour care when children stay until 14 : 00 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time employees have kitchen service starting on September 1st : they warm up the delivered food , add salad , raw food and fruit , divide the meal individually , give away food , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the workers are categ@@ or@@ ised by a k@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as sev@@ ent@@ een groups - decide about the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen assistants now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital to implement ped@@ ago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s what it is about : healthy food and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a known force in the day@@ time K@@ ita , a person familiar to them and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
the cleaning of the K@@ ita spaces - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future .
in addition to improving the kitchen performance , this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm that it has proved to be the most economical in terms of cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign lending for the city , it is from the press office .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re @-@ tuned .
&quot; but these hours are not so much in weight for around 750 people in the area of education , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of the Society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , acting head of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women are chann@@ eling during the Council elections . three women are candidates for the role of the vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and be included in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5 .
the Tali@@ ban has published threats to an election process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international fighting actions to an advisory role .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , for the first time , the elections will be handed over to the next government peac@@ efully by a democr@@ atically elected government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ som said that a strong role for women will intensi@@ fy the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Afgh@@ an independent electoral commission reports that 1.2 million women registered in total registered 3.6 million voters .

according to the police information , the men talked to the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stayed with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 2 : 55 p.m. because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s mobile phone .
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request and continued with her friends .
then one of the perpet@@ rators tried to attack the girl &apos;s cell phone and the girl &apos;s necklace , which was mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous .

G@@ MB concern about investment in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union wants to as@@ certain the long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow at managers of the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company has out@@ weigh@@ ed the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the factory , which produces hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea bis@@ cuits besides other products .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first experienced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the company manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie called on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to say concerns that funding for modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be promoted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ MB Senior Organ@@ izer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about our business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross is deeply affected by our members .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have worked here and the workforce is strongly focused on the local community and large @-@ scale Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , under the prospect of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the Eastern end of Glasgow is in urgent need of a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the director at T@@ oll@@ cross only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to it as we appreciate the ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago we had a regular meeting with co @-@ workers and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed openly .
we discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we continually review our business - and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site fully and completely . should our operations change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La League may interest your interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not indul@@ ge in its persecution by N@@ ey@@ mar after giving an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to trigger its release clause , but did it warn Barcelona three years ago before the world record event ?
the sensational approach has hal@@ ted the transfer window in summer , as the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returning to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds .
after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional sports@@ man in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a source near the Catal@@ ans Board insi@@ sts that the club has always done its best to take care of him since his arrival in San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the soccer world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G president before this prospect ?
when Manchester City expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we &apos;ll be in opposition to them , we &apos;ll contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to let one of our players sign in , it will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , whereby the Spanish association expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International of Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their prices for N@@ ey@@ mar .
sco@@ oter re@@ posed and damaged
in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown perpet@@ r@@ ator has deliberately kno@@ cked off a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ feld street in front of the property number 30 , causing damage to material damage of more than 200 Euro .

on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old came from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um with his VW at 7 : 55 a.m. on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in the direction of Le@@ ese .
in the area of the urban surrounding of Stol@@ zen@@ au , he met a car in his lane so that he had to move to the right .
the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the guard rail .
there was a lot of damage to cars on the car .
the driver of the coming car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ hau@@ led a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident .
according to the accident damage it can be good that the Mer@@ ced@@ es@@ driver had not noticed the accident at all .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &apos;s report reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussion .
Christian Wei@@ z@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; announced after publication in front of the German press agency , he received an ap@@ ology from the former bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the master master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ eri@@ zed Pope Bene@@ dict XVI .
it would be very useful for the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false estim@@ ation of the processes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critici@@ zed , on the other hand , that the reporting of violence at the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is measured with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; double standards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in terms of the ass@@ aults in Regensburg , no one doub@@ ted that it is a &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful act &quot; that would have to be pun@@ ish@@ able and prevented in the future ; however , the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , Hist@@ orian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics committee , is striking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ f . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis also said in the interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; we like to go to the church and this is a dev@@ our@@ ing fres@@ co . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stri@@ kes were a normal ped@@ ago@@ gical means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be finished with happy children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they found it unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to past decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports about the abuse , pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; completely wrong@@ ly , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who with R@@ atz@@ inger summari@@ zed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I have to take shelter from Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report .
what exactly is the 440 @-@ page report presented by the German lawyer Ulrich Weber from the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen became victims of attacks , 67 dom@@ es@@ tic@@ ates sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the early 1990s &quot; with high plau@@ sibility . &quot;
in the final report it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary it can be said that master master R. R. in many cases employed forms of physical and psychological violence .
especially in the case of high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could be even more violent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to many other accused , many victims nevertheless estimated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him despite violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger views his opinion .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the incidents of violence against protective char@@ coal at Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , &quot; is a contradictory picture of Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
for one , many students highlight his &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears as ch@@ ol@@ ery and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who became more tangible to the Ö@@ f@@ teren , when a dom@@ ici@@ le did not bring top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appears at all .
there are eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or co @-@ knowledge in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the prepar@@ atory school also occurred outside of its sphere of influence .
it is possible to blame him at best , to experience it too late , or to have taken initial indications not seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , on which it worked , was felt by virtually all respon@@ dents as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the broad majority of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s broad majority also presents a very excellent testimony , &quot; sincer@@ ely , &quot; &quot; sincer@@ ely , &quot; &quot; sincer@@ ely , &quot; &quot; sincer@@ ely , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and sweets and &quot; always surrounded by children . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ains about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which led to flood breaks .
the fact that he did not only kne@@ ad with chairs and threw the key@@ ring on the floor , but also par@@ ted the sla@@ p and attracted too nau@@ ghty boys to the hair or ears , he even admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for this .
it must be said , however , that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able period , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents and teachers .
do you still know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us was born before 1968 .
I also experienced that in a secular school , a state gymn@@ asi@@ um .
compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the app@@ alling sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school , these are certainly bag@@ at@@ elles .
one wonders if it is not to do with his acquain@@ tance and his role as a brother of Bene@@ dict XVI , that many media just fell on him .
many people who have never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently on the Bavarian pop@@ e .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
in the media , in connection with the report a lot was reported about the subject of mis@@ use at Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger placed in the final report any involvement or co @-@ knowledge with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claims to be entrusted with the master of the cathedral .
not even the parents were dedicated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of those affected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem with the clari@@ fication of sexual abuse has been and is , however , that most victims are silent .
if they did not even entr@@ ust themselves to parents and brothers , then certainly not a ch@@ oral director who , professionally , would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen disciples judge R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role with regard to the mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able pup@@ il formulated it : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely knowledge and could have been able to stop the respective perpet@@ r@@ ator .
I think it ... even for truly absurd to assume that it was calculated ... To have opened more intru@@ sive or clearer or even more , than to their parents , dormit@@ ory managers , trusted teachers , etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that students and / or their environment affected him in the run @-@ up could not be confirmed during the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus acqu@@ itted of any participation .
he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to the ad .
therefore there is no reason to link its good name to these vile crimes , as it unfortunately happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media there was a great deal of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non@@ violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; watching &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that in the coverage everything was mixed and mixed up to a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , right in the middle , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is in turn a mis@@ use of the report .
there is , namely , clean@@ ly separated : between the pre @-@ school and the secondary school of the cathedral @-@ cats , between sexual abuse and violence and , we say once , other prec@@ urs@@ ors .
in addition , the report covers incidents from the period since 1945 , so also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral director of the cath@@ ed@@ r@@ als .
all the horri@@ ble investig@@ ative ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases where boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were rig@@ ged and mal@@ treated , and among them horri@@ bly suffering , were all at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where real sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions had to be ruled out .
but the master builder Georg R@@ atz@@ inger didn &apos;t have anything to do with them , because he didn &apos;t get the boys to face when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on this , as most of the witnesses stated , was tab@@ oo subject to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre @-@ school &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was only fortunate to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise &quot; states .
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was indeed discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims cher@@ ished the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even combine positive memories with him despite violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at most it remains the reproach to have looked away .
yet despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported from the states at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he had just started to establish himself and from the events at a school where he wasn &apos;t working and was responsible ( so the witness ) didn &apos;t want to hear anything , and then only back in 1993 .
does Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently shut the ears in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pre @-@ school the test penalty should continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the danger of negative press release , he recommended an urgent intervention .
that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was , as test pen@@ alties were also banned in Bavaria .
before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as each of us still knows .
it was difficult for him to assess where the affected people might be exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where really the permitted limit had been exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he has always looked away .
it just doesn &apos;t .
only in 1980 it was officially aboli@@ shed in schools in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis states that it is unfair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ ago@@ gical standards at that time .
how do you see that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we histori@@ ans talk about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fall @-@ kn@@ ck of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. the danger of judging the past with today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess is already right .
of course , this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was horri@@ ble at all times and also not for what was bre@@ ached in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond that at that time .
this is all horri@@ ble and I am happy that it will finally be worked out .
but at the same time I have to take shelter for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him .
its means of discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing , so to draw ear @-@ files and to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was banned , it was strictly adher@@ ed to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; which picture of his time in Regensburg has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger reproduced in the conversations with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
was the subject of testing capital punishment in this regard as well ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Bene@@ dict XVI , tells from his perspective , that the cats only played a minor role .
nevertheless , I don &apos;t know that he led a strict regi@@ ment there .
but even this must be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding un@@ conditioned discipline , it would have hardly been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ g from the hitherto rather nation@@ ally known Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , true cultural ambass@@ adors of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y alone , one does not play a great singer and a great singer before every success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and overcoming .
what kind of person did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger experience in the conversations with her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work in the book and beyond , I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful , humor@@ ous , basic , deeply believing and heart @-@ good people , of whom one could not imagine that he could only hurt a fly .
I regularly receive , like many former dom@@ es@@ cats today , 23 years after his listing , regular contact with him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family .
those who did not forgive him until this day , that he was once stern to them , are clearly in the minority .
today most of the cath@@ ed@@ r@@ als are grateful to him for enrich@@ ing their lives and sharing the world of music .
and that he is always a good , fa@@ ther@@ ly teacher - a strict father , sure , that may be - but also a lo@@ vable respect for respect to which they still look and honor them .
and please , again quite clearly : all that is presented to it are educational methods that were the order of the day at that time .
we can be happy that we have overcome this time long ago .
but it is most unfair , a man just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent that is behind it , all too obvious .
for the report that has just been published reli@@ eves it .
now the stand @-@ up , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without those outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
