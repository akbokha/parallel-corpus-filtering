<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irish institution, where young people meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A pit chapel, where it is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "gardeners cultivate the erstwhile cause of peasants." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying if maps are not up to date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows who had to get upset before, because the car navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals Bavaria of the state government, are anything but up-to-date - but therefore very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how towns and communities have changed since the 19th century in the spread-area of the Munich Mercury.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a Flickenteppich, which one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large picture postcard, more detailed maps, so-called primeval sheets, were incorporated into cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bayerisches distortions administration between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first surveying of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops were finally dragged down with the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801: it was the present-day neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map.</seg>
<seg id="18">Elector Max IV. Joseph further drove the project forward, founded the "Topographische Bureau," and thus the Bavarian surveying government.</seg>
<seg id="19">The composition sheet for Munich dates from the year 1856 and is to be found like all others on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison between early / today is most impressive in the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the 1856 map.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was incorporated in the Munich suburb 21 years after the map was created.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the current Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a small-scale map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered plots from the so-called "Urabsorbing" from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small plots do not occupy more farmers today - but small gardeners of the plant" "" "Land in Sun" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">Theresienwiese, which has been the scene of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in the 19th century a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the area of the current district Au-Haidhausen, in the area of the current district Au-Haidhausen, it is not only the street name "at the Gasteig" or "On the Air" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one once locked people with insanity.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich District Irrenanstalt" "" "Auf der Auer Lüften" "" "was created." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard of Gudden presided over the institution - that psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended up using the so-called Irish." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he prohibited the personnel to use force against the inmates, "said Hermann Wilhelm, head of the museum Haidhausen, who worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients there was first place, later expanded to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the rotors in 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists since 2006, has been located there since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">On the site of the former Auer Anstalt, young people meet in Salesianum in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">The football field of the TSV München East is located to the west, east residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the children's house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was built in architectural reference to the original building of the Irren institution, which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed as" "" "Main Square" "" "in 1856 and the Kaufingerstrasse was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombings of the Allies tore many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remains to this day - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English institute, small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages were once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line-line takes place.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider you can compare the old Munich-map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Ombudsman publishes Travel Warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Fares issued a warning for coloured people who are travelling to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is to enter into force by August 28, 2017, urges Afro-American travellers, visitors and Missouri to get special attention when travelling through the state and caution must be noted, as a number of questionable, racial incidents occur in the entire state and are noted here," said the Group's opinion.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted Missouri law, which makes it harder for people to win discrimination, as well as the state prosecuting authorities that are disproportionately aimed at minorities, encouraged the group to release the warning, the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "they will be stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed," "" "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such frequency that we have not heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the trip through the state and was put into custody by the Missouri Police, without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Missouri General Prosecutor's Office in which black motorists in the state will be halted 75 percent more frequently than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people need to be ready to bring chew money or know relatives that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri reported in 2015 100 hate crimes, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report program, which classifies the state in relation to the number of such violations to the 16th ranking of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the states adopted immigration laws, obliging local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations, which, according to the ACLU, will contribute to further racial recognition.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently, stakeholders have used the measure as response to specific laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Soft aunching project is spontaneous</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischbacher Weidezvn project is a successful project and will continue next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac provided an image on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the legal trenchyhof of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU resort met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann first granted insights into his farm, where he farms 55 hectares of lawns and 40 hectares of forest, provides 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and houses holiday guests in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Black Forest" "" "is for him the alternative free marketing path for the milk of his cows," "" "says Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">Only regionales arrive at the table of the holiday guests.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "as he is also the chairman of the" "" "BLHV" "", "he described the" "" "spontaneous" "" "project as" "" "important" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can't generate profitably on such steep faces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area is responsible for a lot of work, a lot must be worked on with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight here with the conditions and topography," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the farm and managed it without any chemical plant protection and fertiliser, even if it does not lead to bioactivity.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognised the importance of the soft-fence project and is happy about the leader-promotion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">Farmers would have to be supported at a cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the reforestation of the land could be pulled out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and thinking about how they will continue their operations," "" "said the Mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Because of the subsidies, farmers are often criticised</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots were fenced off by eleven participants in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The maintenance area is thus 40 hectares, which must not be forested until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half was promoted by leader, a quarter bore the municipality of Fischbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of soft-fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," "" "explained Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and rural women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">Peter Weiß also said: "the best food products are produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Conservation Line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg permits the state-of-the-art promotion of soft fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to open the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The pre-requisite is the existence of a sponsorship marked by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the area to be enclosed must not be slippery (slope above 35 per cent) and must therefore be threatened by reforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">The application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build a fence of just 16 kilometres, is currently underway for the Fisherberg Weionnade project in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="96">The maintenance area is equivalent to 35 hectares, while the calculated costs are more than EUR 112 billion.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans estimate this as well as any other - therefore the most carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the Firdo square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump-Regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated quarrel with Jim Acosta from CNN about the president's proposals for drastic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To be fair, Miller didn't handle the statue himself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have liked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But it took on its meaning, and in particular the importance that it was attributed to, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta appealed, "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem you refer to is added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is factually correct, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance of the stirring words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, / your oppressed masses, who long to breathe freely, / the ellowing waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable apostasy" "" "was better to see on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict, because of the significance of a statue, is part of a broader political and cultural conflict: it is indeed a conflict about America's significance.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends, who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they had made a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was to show the connections between French and American republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical depiction.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people of the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone but rather an early neo-conservatives that bring the American flame to the converted world: "Lady Liberty is progressing.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not lighten the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual, Limbaugh was encountered here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is entirely a question of the viewpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see her as seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the deck of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not lighten the way, but ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchers, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team captain.</seg>

<seg id="160">Block critics on Facebook: don't whip around a public office if you can't tolerate the heating of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the papers struck him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He dabbled in the critique, certainly.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783 Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute, we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on being more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And that is why the American Civil Liberties Union accused him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"" "the governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with" "" "Na, and?." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "" "" "it's just Facebook," "" "said many people." ""</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state which is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest agreement of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict observance of the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means of connecting with his voters and playing his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore the blocking of persons coming to the Governor's side - which is a public forum that is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the Governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest recited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," "" "she wrote in the comments section of the news broadcast" "" "The Post" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="188">"" "what the governor referred to as" "" "concentrated spam-attack" "" "would probably call others" "" "intercession" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook Era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in former times when one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical corals or to arrest and silence protesters.</seg>
<seg id="191">But it just happens digitally.</seg>

<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable port had a similar effect as the internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter pen struck him on his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous Trolls.</seg>

<seg id="435">Who orders a "Model 3" today can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tesla manages to drive his brand-new production lines which have never been tested in practice with maximum capacity utilization.</seg>

<seg id="439">EPA leader Pruitt retires because of the delay in the Obama-Era rules to reduce emissions</seg>
<seg id="440">One day after he was accused of 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the chief of the environmental protection authority, accepted his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce the emissions of smog-causing pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the change when its agency proved to be responsive to the needs of national environmental authorities than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the suit which had been raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">It is a time limit that went off for States on October 1 to comply with the 2015 standards of ground ozone.</seg>
<seg id="444">Pruitt announced in June that he would delay the observance for a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfere in local decisions or interfere with economic growth."</seg>
<seg id="445">Pruitt, who was prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment, was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="446">Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly gone over to blocking or delaying regulations that resist the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pruit regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">Last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA authority exceeded its authority when trying to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration, the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.</seg>
<seg id="449">In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed that his reversal of ozone standards simply reinforces the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states by the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards.</seg>
<seg id="450">"" "" "" "under previous administrations, the EPA has often not complied with the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others, and in an agreement to determine the date for execution," "" "said Pruitt, who complained the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job." ""</seg>
<seg id="451">"" "" "" "we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously." ""</seg>
<seg id="452">"" "we also take the law and the authority that is given to us seriously." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="453">"" "however, the EPA statement that Pruitt will eventually use its" "" "authority to delay and all other legally available authority" "" "to ensure that the provisions are based on solid policies and the best available information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="454">Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive reconstitution of the Ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="455">A draft approved last month is to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.</seg>
<seg id="456">The measure was not yet voted in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="457">The New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who chaired the Coalition of States who had sued the EPA in this week said that the group is intending to maintain the legal pressure.</seg>
<seg id="458">"the reversal of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important benefit to health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog who flows into their communities," said Schneiderman.</seg>

<seg id="465">Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church</seg>
<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church the old cemetery area in Tumlingen was invited to a serenade on Sunday 16th July at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historical St. Hilarius plant is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">The visitors of the Sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the place have made the friends and supporter Tumlingens a concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stresses: "it is a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in written documents in the Württembergian document: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen including the "Vogbey" in Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the document, on the hill of Tumlinger, apart from the former parish church, there was also a beautiful courtyard, to which the church or the patron saint belonged and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As seen from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt from 1858, besides the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which today are still recognizable in the local image of Tumlingen, the "mountain" of the third, the magnificent settlement of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps dating back to 1600 are underlined by these historical facts.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from the early medieval church right.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church, furnished and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also bequeathed this self-church.</seg>
<seg id="478">This entailed the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The size of the two breaks at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell rang for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed over later during the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were hammered and the belfry were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and the church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The ruins of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">During the New Year's Eve 1834 a storm broke the steeple and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortune, the tower was broken off.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower-werve existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are cultivating the Hilarius plant by Dieter Dockhorn as successors to Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">As organisers, the friends and promoters invite Tumlingens on Sunday 16th July to the sixth Serenade on the old cemetery to the St. Hilariuskapelle.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Hartmut Romann, a local leader, speaks the final word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 15.30.</seg>
<seg id="499">To conclude the serenade a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"" "" "" "enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest," "" "organisers the fantastic view." ""</seg>
<seg id="501">The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organisers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is of significance for tumours and hearing welders.</seg>
<seg id="503">The friends and promoters of Tumlingens are particularly committed to their home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini reaffirms.</seg>

<seg id="505">"" "" "" "Boisheim refuses," "" "does not foresee a legal basis for the construction and has therefore appealed to the councillor." ""</seg>
<seg id="506">"" "the association" "" "Boisheim wears itself" "" "has called upon Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to accept his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette." ""</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette no wind turbines would have been allowed, since at the time in Viersen only a wind power concentration zone existed at the border to Schwalmtal.</seg>
<seg id="509">Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time, the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">"" "such zones should prevent" "" "asparagus" "" "of the landscape." ""</seg>
<seg id="511">The city of Viersen had decided a second wind-force-zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days before by a change of the land-use plan - but the district government Düsseldorf had not approved, because of a form-defect.</seg>

<seg id="518">However, they probably do not lead to the fact that the procedure is stopped.</seg>
<seg id="519">With regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday did not want to contend with the argument of the association "Boisheim."</seg>
<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build four each 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen was directly involved, had concluded lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares large area.</seg>
<seg id="522">The construction of the four wind turbines is expected to cover the electricity demand of around 11 400 households - that is roughly one fifth of the electricity demand of all four-day households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersen's city council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park Linnich near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the district Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="889">"" "in 432 cases the conclusion was that the person" "" "may be under the age of 18" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests are performed only in cases where the person's age is questioned.</seg>

<seg id="892">"" "" "" "we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are fairly constant," "" "he said to the magazine The Local." ""</seg>
<seg id="893">The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age.</seg>
<seg id="894">In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said there are 442 cases that "suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="895">When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet evaluated the 581 published results, she noted that in 243 of these cases the person openly said that she was 18 years old this year.</seg>
<seg id="896">The method of medical age assessment, during X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, was also criticized in some areas.</seg>
<seg id="897">A sceptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus the Karolinska Institute, whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they were going through puberty sooner or later than usual.</seg>

<seg id="904">The work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg proceed well.</seg>
<seg id="905">On Wednesday, a seven tons heavy concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lauterbach.</seg>

<seg id="907">In April, the work started simultaneously on all three of the three rebuilding bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="908">The end of the building is planned for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule is adhered to.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is a arch bridge made of concrete, which is clad with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 meters.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the other two bridges, it has come into the years now.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure stability and traffic safety, the three structures are now thoroughly refurbished.</seg>
<seg id="914">The two other bridges lead over the Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are made of red Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10,60 meters long.</seg>
<seg id="917">On Wednesday morning on the northern side, the bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has got a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a border fastener, which is also used as operating system.</seg>
<seg id="919">On Friday, a 2.20 m wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway is to run.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing about this is that it is finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridges.</seg>
<seg id="923">Special finger tip feeling has required the laying of lines through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">Because there is also a fibre-optic cable that many companies are connected to.</seg>
<seg id="925">The residents were informed about the project in advance of the work.</seg>
<seg id="926">In addition, fish and crustaceans had to be fished.</seg>
<seg id="927">Traffic is regulated by traffic lights for the bridges between the building yard and the conglomeration in the direction of Schramberg.</seg>
<seg id="928">For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach village entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the altitude of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden" is fully closed.</seg>
<seg id="929">The cost of the three bridge arrangements amounts to 700 000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the soccer rules of football have impact on Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unhindered issues of European football clubs will not interfere with Neymars world record transfer from Barcelona to Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come from UEFA for Paris Saint-Germain, as the conductive organization that monitors the European game has the power to prohibit teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG has to demonstrate at some point that the transfer from Neymar has been financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to get the Brazilians out of their contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make money easy for Neymar to sign and bring him to a galaxy of other stars in the face of the financing of the team by the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Associations may use a lot of money to buy players, but they have to deal with legitimate income sources that enable the break-even point in their football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs who had enormous debts in their quest for success were effectively deceiving and risking to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP moved from concentrating on the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the novel Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder business.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP expiration period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen in favour of the Presidency in 2015, UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferim, continues to be scared of excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "surely, FFP is not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future," "" "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week." ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for invoicing over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the sales revenues for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 44.4 million euros in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 brought the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs to try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenue by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a cataran enterprise could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the PSA sponsorship was being inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come about payments from the 2022 Organizing Committee in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar are contested that Neymar World Cup Ambassador will become an ambassador and a such maneuver for the UEFA regulatory authorities could be easy to find out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The sanctions against PSG so far imply that UEFA will be more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They talked about the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, since they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 with a turnover of 542.4 million euros has generated a profit of more than 10 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last financial year must still be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymars arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales after signature will rise by at least 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players and tried to prevent Neymars's move by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"" "" "" "it is a clear case of" "" "financial doping" "" "with the club and the state," "" "said the President of the La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's final ownership of PSG." ""</seg>
<seg id="1154">Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American Sport-Tycoons, shares the reservations of La League against a state financed by an association.</seg>
<seg id="1155">"it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="1156">"once a country owns an association, everything is possible.</seg>

<seg id="1158">Swiss is looking for a new supplier</seg>
<seg id="1159">In recent years Chocolat Frey Board chocolate has made Swiss chocolate.</seg>
<seg id="1160">Now the close cooperation is ahead of a possible end: the airline rewrites the order.</seg>
<seg id="1161">On request from the news agency, Swiss-spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report from the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1162">According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1163">The products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control.</seg>
<seg id="1164">"we are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," said the spokesperson.</seg>
<seg id="1165">Approximately 17 million small red-white packed chocolates distribute to 14 grams per year the flight attendants before landing on the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="1166">Swiss did not want to provide information about the costs.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Northwest Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs.</seg>
<seg id="1168">But more important is the advertising effect: it is a prestigious order for a jog manufacturer.</seg>
<seg id="1169">Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants are interested in the new tender.</seg>
<seg id="1170">Only Swiss manufacturers come into question.</seg>
<seg id="1171">According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to make an effort to renew the treaty over the spring of 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1172">For the sda, the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not able to make a statement.</seg>
<seg id="1173">Swiss has been distributing chocolate boards on board their flights since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="1174">Before the Swiss signed a contract with Migros's daughter, Barry Callebaut has delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.</seg>
<seg id="1175">Swiss Life introduced the opportunity to place the logo two and a half years ago with Chocolat Frey.</seg>
<seg id="1176">The airline cooperates with various Swiss chocolate producers.</seg>
<seg id="1177">On long-haul flights, the customers of the First Class will be spoiled with treats from the Confiserie Sprüngli, in the Business Class passengers Schoggi from Lindt and in Economy Class Schoggi of Chocolat Frey.</seg>

<seg id="1183">Nostalgia goes to the niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective."</seg>
<seg id="1184">This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 "s, for the 90-year-Grunge era (when the pre-thinkers David Wain and Michael Show alter the Sketch comedy" The State "for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to larger things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact, it is equally parody and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as a franchise it feels like the time was short.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"" "" "" "first Day of Camp" "" "worked surprisingly well, not just because of his absurd humour (it contained an original story for a speaking tin of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1188">By sticking to the core of the gig - middle-aged actors play cool kids who will grow up - nevertheless, they managed to regain the impossibility of winning the last part of the wit.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"ten Years Later," with his adults who are now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more to the casting principle, among them a riff on the Stalker Films of the 90's like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand which Scales the Cradle").</seg>
<seg id="1190">"" "at one point, an Apple-PowerBook, some inline skates and" "" "a number of other things from 1991" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The gracious Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Romantic, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is another insane-vicious plot, included in the Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-known impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, the exams are the best part of the franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It is a lot of fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons's sub-lip of "singles," whose former big-man-on-camp Andy feels like an old cracker.</seg>
<seg id="1197">It is the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive Seven Up! series until he reaches what I consider his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose final scene will show the band how they will visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of nostalgia: to revive the Cold War of "The Americans," to the film Atomic Blonde and even to "GLOW" with his East vs. West ring fight iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director is to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest, who fight for truth, atheism and the way of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici whose dialogues are synchronised by Channing Tatum (also an executable producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it is not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice flags to watch (the police spend time watching chess on TV as Americans might do with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of famous actors - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - provides a decent game 'Find out the voice'.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is so much involved in the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask - that it often plays like a single one.</seg>
<seg id="1206">There are six long episodes, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective," which was edited for a lower length, could better furnish his Agitprop Satire as Gregory and Iosef always visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a heap of hamburgers.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a food for a fortune.</seg>
<seg id="1209">The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: we even make it with our own recent history and with theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1210">A blow against drug mafia in the country</seg>
<seg id="1211">The police succeeded in a strike against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.</seg>
<seg id="1212">On Wednesday morning, many objects were searched in the Black Forest Baar district in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the public prosecutor's office in Konstanz was on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1213">15 accused were arrested between the ages of 25 and 77 and have already issued arrest warrants against them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">In addition, officials ensured greater amounts of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.</seg>
<seg id="1215">At the same time in Italy two persons were arrested.</seg>
<seg id="1216">There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects of Italy.</seg>
<seg id="1217">The two are therefore probably supplied to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.</seg>
<seg id="1219">More than 300 police officers were deployed.</seg>
<seg id="1220">The Mafia's members are accused of organized drug trafficking, serious acts of violence, attempted murder, robbery and blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Since summer 2016, the public prosecutor's office has established Constance against organised drug trafficking in Southern Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Between the public prosecutors in Constance and Palermo, there was a lively exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Therefore, on Wednesday morning, the great deal was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The aim of the investigations was mainly Italian nationals with close reference to the Italian mafia.</seg>

<seg id="1265">The political decision makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members seeking an increase in this month, as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1266">In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 at 1.6% and warned that the pressure on household income would continue, with inflation likely to rise to just under 3% in autumn.</seg>

<seg id="1279">Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly after the end of the year.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Live the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former Bankerin with a passion for real estate, reduced itself from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court Apartment in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne said.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I was looking for something comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot was completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room estate with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add a cup of storage space and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, plenty of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">"" "that was my request," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms overlap so that the architectural challenge consisted in creating a mezzanine where you could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to release the award.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend down." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not only about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with much additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">A classic copper light window by Retrouvius looks over the glamorous living area for the mezzanine.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and lighting.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to let it work for longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all corners and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">By perceiving a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folding kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering went in," "" "explains Erfan from the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is important, so that when you push the door, it glides very easily." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "at the end of the day, you will sell the base area - or how your property is appreciated," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the soil size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to increase the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't fall in love with electrical outlets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and an increased square meter number of some standard into something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave this.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers spent four decades after their Italian family founded the Dynasty, in a dispute because of one of the biggest real estate imperialist Victorias worth over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton-Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul. he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets are to be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp argument about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers collected 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family purchased a business at Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There, the Westco jeans family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail outlets.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis portfolio now includes offices in the city center, Brunswick and Sorrento's development areas, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">"" "after an agreement with her late father Colin - by Paul as" "" "main operator and the dominant personality" "" "described in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about a third." ""</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file states that this means that Colin has a value of $316 million and Paul has a value of 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The distribution of real estate and cash proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "the units proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," "" "he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers now fight for control over the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, has excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul to manage some possessions incompetently.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early affidavit, submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1372">The cost increases in the event, with hundreds of pages with affirmations, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and from both parties held law firms.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first Jeansdrift of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, were hoping to benign their property to their sons.</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps appointed new Chief of Staff to limit the presidency's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that White House's new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the White House's new Chief of Staff, met with senior executives on his first working day, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trumps's White House that he wanted to repair: poor information coming into the hands of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnose makes sense, but others have tried to tame poump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps's relationship to television goes back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if candidate Trump has been upset because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of jobs that were to convince," "" "said the former election campaign consultant Sam Nunberg in February." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote in the time that" "" "the key to keep Trumps Twitter Habits is under control, according to six ex-election officials, to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter custom was ever "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Maybe these campaign officials know something that we don't know for others - that Trumps tweets would have included more fuel without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know about tweets that have not sent Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his employees managed to keep it away from him a couple of times, their efforts paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented it from provoking Trump controversies.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump Material that may promote their views of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advisers to induce dubious information to the president for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press-outs, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he insists on figuring out where these come from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">This was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously offered a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, "being the source behind a heap of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banished from Twitter due to harassment or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has voiced false accusations in the past and revoked it.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "Trump read the article and began asking staff about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the paperwork."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work out?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on the 1st of March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">After the closure of the Birkenhof by the then Ambiente equipment company mbH on April 13, 2014, approximately 30,000 overnight stays were lost at the time and also receipts due to the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the autumn of 2014, in view of the dramatic increase in numbers of refugees arriving in the district, the hotel building was offered to the district office as a collective accommodation offering controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the Municipal Council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But especially Freudenstadt's mayor, Julian Osswald, defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties in the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisengrafico with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof in a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it to a house of the three-stars plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bath Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1458">At the former Hotel Birkenhof there have been building shuttles in front of the entrance for quite some time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovation works are carried out.</seg>
<seg id="1459">The floors were torn out, ceilings partly dismantled, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single building site.</seg>

<seg id="1463">Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>

<seg id="1468">You don't want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an upscale downtown level, shaver points out.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The Waldhotel Luise, with its approximately 60 rooms, wants to set up wide, explains the shaver further.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Both individual vacationers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="1471">He already had talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, said Scherer.</seg>
<seg id="1472">The ideas of the city were congruous with those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">Asked about the amount of investments, Thomas Scherer does not want to specify exactly.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Just under a million euros, he reckons.</seg>
<seg id="1476">The external systems are also brought to the front, which is already clearly visible.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia affair: U.S. Special Representator sets up Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russian affair around US President Donald Trump, special issuer Robert Mueller is said to have appointed a so-called Grand Jury after a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">In recent weeks, the Panel included the work, wrote the Wall Street Journal, calling on people familiar with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper took the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The broadcaster CNN reported that there are already initial charges of the Gremium in connection with a meeting between Trumps's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time being targeted in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller researches whether there were agreements between Trumps campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The investigation is focused on several men who acted as advisers to the Republicans in the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller also took a close look at the private and business environment of Trumps.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote a few weeks ago that the Sondergenealogist Trump entered the centre personally and accused the accusation that the President could possibly hinder the judiciary in the course of the affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to examine the present evidence in possible criminal cases and to decide whether charges are to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jury is therefore also called anchor clips.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Most of the time, they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The process always takes place behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be switched on by the public prosecutor to charge people with an oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN broadcaster, invitations have already been issued, which revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr., Trumps consultant and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his dam chief Paul Manafort were also involved in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the suspension shows that Mueller does not let himself intimidate in his work and that if necessary, he wants to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the collection of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the establishment of the Gremium is the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause for concern for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, on Thursday evening, the president used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russian Affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "Russia's history is a total invention," "" "said Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">"" "the topic gives the Democrats a way to" "" "feel good, because they have nothing else to talk about." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special advisor, Ty Cobb, stated in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But he also usually works in secret, he emphasised.</seg>
<seg id="1506">"" "the White House endorses any action that accelerates the work of the special agent in a" "" "fair way" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1507">"" "" "" "the former FBI boss James Comey said three times that I will not be determined against the President." ""</seg>
<seg id="1508">One has no reason to assume that something has changed in it, it was said in the Declaration.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"" "" "" "because of this rooting, accusations against Trump have become louder, he wants to hinder the judiciary." ""</seg>
<seg id="1511">In June, Comey said before a Senate committee, Trump asked him to set up an investigation against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">After the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special issuer and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation as to whether Trump Mueller wants to release.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent investigator of the Congress, such as the Watergate affair around the later retired President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on the urges of the President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>

<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">According to research data, the extent to which climate change has played a role in the breaking down of the iceberg is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1525">For some 30 years, however, there has been a series of unusual breakthroughs in the region for around 30 years, writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a fact background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this can be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The broken-off colossus was so far part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the head of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">To the north of this ice shelf, the balance of waxing and breakage was disturbed some years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete ice shelf will be broken down there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, because the front edge has never gone so far as it is currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice sheet stands under tension and can crumble if a piece is broken at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of ice shelf and ice mountain does not increase the level of sea level, as they float on the water and ice as much water as it follows after melting.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the glaciers flowing directly into the sea and much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, but only to a lesser extent, writes the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth-largest shelf of the Antarctic with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean approximately 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "although there is no direct link to climate change, the ice sign is now in a more dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the longest withdrawal since the beginning of the records," "" "he confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists is controversial whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will continue to grow or fall back in the long term and possibly coincide, his colleague Adrian Luckman said and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even though these researchers do not return the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many of the ice-mischives of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen in the last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of the Antarctic stretches towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to the research program British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In the last 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has heated around three degrees and thereby count among the areas in which the temperature is the fastest.</seg>

<seg id="1750">Audi is expected to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter-reaction</seg>
<seg id="1751">One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW claimed that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The BMW chairman said that "there are smarter options available as driving restrictions," and thus moved to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or limit diesel vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1754">None of the enterprises described the undertakings as recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The cost of the car manufacturers to install equipment for neutralising exhaust fumes from diesel vehicles also increases, making it difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of denying the powerful car companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">The companies attempt to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called off-off devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but return in normal driving conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1760">In the United States, several Volkswagen employees were charged, others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1762">The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1763">At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen, after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to bypass the emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was expanded.</seg>
<seg id="1764">The inclusion of Audi into the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes more than proportionately to the win of Volkswagen.</seg>

<seg id="1784">Even in China Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Again and again the artist was inspired by cities.</seg>

<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which in the spring brought much less rain and in the autumn a lot more.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly Riodoce usually meet Wednesdays to check their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what feels more secure: they are supposed to take their children into the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and gut feelings reach.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of standing on the government's payroll or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There are no rest periods of violence, and as the corpses accumulate throughout the country, more and more journalists are in the process: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is the publisher and her inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "wrote Valdez in one of his many books about violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the 1930s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a Special Federal Prosecutor's Office was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, it has initiated only two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of killings associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa although they are inconspicuous and although the terrain is still more traiteful.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little use, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know the why, we mix everything." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15 Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and was shot at him 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated with "Twelfth River."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius drove away in his car and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and the extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country since rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa anyone or more people are shot on the streets every day or that the cemetery full of ornate, two-storied mausoleums for drug addicts that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken by guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February there was the publication of an interview with Damascene Lopez, a leader of one of the rivaling cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, suspected aisle members bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own security following the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined Riodoce with five colleagues and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the drug poison problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the paper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to be able to publish highly accurate investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to handle.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Prize" for her coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to continue living," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ award." ""</seg>

<seg id="1854">"" "" "" "you have to take over the task that you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb." ""</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked," "" "What have you done in the face of so many dead? why did you not say what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Feodoce-Team misses Valdez, the spawning bird that could curb like a dockworker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for routine destruction?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how best to do her job and stay alive.</seg>

<seg id="1863">"" "" "" "these things were not allowed," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>

<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>

<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - as not in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative smugglers, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the space in which the staff of Riodoce met for safety training, no mobile phones were allowed. days before it became known that spyware, which is exclusively sold to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside two policemen were seeking shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-size neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in joke, some of the reporters questioned whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the policemen who had designated the governor themselves as untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters have gone to the mountain landscape where the drug gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the edition of this week, Riodoce has been embroidered on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the ex-known Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposure to the state expenditures concentrated on the home town of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the office of the prosecutor, conducting a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or what happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI) that dominated all the political levels almost the whole century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-calibre cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locality, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, readers of Valdez would have considered the best informed source of kidnapping.</seg>

<seg id="1885">"" "" "" "now all channels of communication with our sources are broken." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1886">The Valdez office became a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the killings of journalists, because the workers have become something they never expected themselves: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few notes and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist in the office of the prosecutor.</seg>

<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA testing that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists have become louder all over the country by decomposing in organised protests "SOS Press" on pavements and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them because they said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since asked her to be subdivided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, government officials and a indifferent society.</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book, "Narco Journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces, who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime.</seg>

<seg id="1928">His incredibly well preserved condition has astounded researchers who describe it as "truly remarkable."</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to National Geographic reports, the armored herbivores are the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk, on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to expose the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy earth-lumps.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>

<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that these herbivores, although covered with armor and resemble a changing tank, are probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The strongly armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique that is known as a counter-shading that is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed it to get better in its surroundings and to evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier made headlines for the first time in May and is now available at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named Borealopelta Markabchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team who has spent more than 7,000 hours to discover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the shady, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the shade-shade is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of today living animals.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by dinosaurs fed by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use counter shading - think of deer, zebras or shingles - are much smaller and vulnerable to prey, which indicates that this nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>

<seg id="1955">The chalk time was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta died in the sea after death and was mummified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the best-preserved petrified dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from muzzle to hip.</seg>

<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people, although it is not built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the southern end of the pedestrian precinct splits the population in proponents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The subject hardly leaves one.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"" "the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page" "" "Volksfreund Bitburg" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2093">While some say to the bit gallery: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That's really great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "don't need a man" (Siggi Betzen) or simply: "megalomahn!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the advocates build that a gallery attracts more customers into the city, of which the rest of the shops also benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the plot in which the farmers market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">It will be concluded with the beginning of the construction work.</seg>

<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I think that is superfluous.</seg>

<seg id="2109">One can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains at our disposal.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive at the top.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, shop outlets are rented in a shopping centre only by larger firms, because the rents there are often not portable for a retailer.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A matching resemblance: artist creates portraits featuring Chelsea Manning's DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room at the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are to be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent out the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth where the former secret service analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after she publicly filed diplomatic reports on WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on August 2nd is called A Becoming resemblance (A matching resemblance).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and pioneering dissident, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted from Manning, Dewey-Hagborg developed a sharp, though somewhat intellectual commentary not only to the forms of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created to identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was convicted of 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Her picture was suppressed through the prison, so much that there was only one photo - a granular, black-and-white selfie, in which Manning is visibly uncomfortable on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg had just emerged from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting DNA from waste to make a picture of how these people might look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated muse have become unequal nephew that exchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a comic "Suppressed Images," illustrated by Shoah Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which President ChelOverseas verdict would convert and she would be able to personally see the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama actually took only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy encounter.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also now something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, since Donald Trump carries out a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops in order to find new tweetable ways to continue the rigid divisions that he should actually troubleshoot.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery Manning called for an end to the "automatic fragmentation," based on gender, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg, by incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), hoped to show how amazingly similar, at least in a biological point of view, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with you is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your employees at your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys didn't work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity some workers did not trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="2208">She called for help from outside.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is on the guard to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to address surveys, provide special groups and demographic groups, employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases whistleblowers allow the C-Suite executives to bypass and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, Co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Mr Errett said she has a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint won.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap-surveys and surveys of specific teams, it provides a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low approval results - so that you can reboot why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies are expected to remain at the top of the workplace culture, so that you won't be the next robber involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post that describes an environment of nuisance in which those who have spoken are punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The global governance, regulation, and compliance sector could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the Financial Technical web site Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber-Fall in Misskredit.</seg>

<seg id="2221">It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.</seg>

<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the court of public opinion has captured the regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company is found that treats its employees poorly or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences by consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, has appointed Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Sooner, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, as the company employs Convercent, problems that have previously been hidden by executives who have been sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair interns - can be identified and addressed more quickly.</seg>

<seg id="2231">Companies began to take Ethics, Values and Employees Engagement in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "social media came to their right" "" "that companies recognized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and burden the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that finds the approval of Venture Capital investors, who have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in funding in February of firms like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with which the entire capital was raised to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzers secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company that's worth their votes and that the work you do is worth it, they feel more strongly committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors can achieve returns if their portfolio companies are well running. companies run well when employees are committed and committed.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase engagement and commitment of the staff, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee involvement according to the experts of workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks staff according to your feedback, it can have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not come quickly enough, or not at all, this can grow disappointment and demotivate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"" "" "" "if you ask for 4,000 comments, you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations," "" "said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the business management company Kotter International, who has seen companies who have relied too much on collecting data." ""</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "for if you don't follow, staff ask," "" "Have you really heard me?" ""</seg>

<seg id="2252">"" "and if you don't care about it, why should I?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported about Glint, so saving.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees it was through the speed of decision making and the quality of communication, able to reorganize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">At Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new insights into employees, and it hopes that in the long run this leads to a better relationship between employees in a sector known for high turnover.</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-s and 1980's.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy sitting at the River Tal in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a moped Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>

<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote "Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories" in 2014, a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional.</seg>

<seg id="2299">And letters always smell of smoke, for at that time a fire was kindled because of the light.</seg>

<seg id="2301">Oh, I love archives! "</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have overrated my welcome greeting") seems to be all too beautiful to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He wandered through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape donations, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Then, at night he drank whiskey and started to write. "</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust received full access until 2006 when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the clerks just started to look after the archive that he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" Oh, throw it on the loft. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the time of English Empires, maps showing who possessed something: "one could think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to fight the two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let everything go its way! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse on a broader base in the English history, including 'The Labourer' following a man who leaves the newly built castle in order to join the peasant uprising of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a turmoil that appeared in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled" Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex, "Rhodes says.</seg>

<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell portrayed his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was only made years later when his coffin was dug out).</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should worry about it</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought that it can't become more crazy in 2017, a new report comes about the technological developments in the area of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take their ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it and we'll see them much more often," "" "said Mr. Sharkey when publishing his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"" "the user can" "" "adapt" "" "his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything from the eye color of the robot via the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails." ""</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it becomes even more disturbing, as many robots have the "personalities" who would look a stepper woman progressively.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personages like "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "Roxxxy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as much as possible," "" "enthuses the website of True Companion." ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day, she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "it can be tired, fixed on conversation or it can" "" "be in mood" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when one takes a step on Frigid (means: reluctant) Farrah, disturb one the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Featured on his website True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxxy?" "" "it says on the website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and their increasing refinement point to something dark and deeper in our culture, to a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with subjection as optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notices their increasing popularity, they nevertheless remain at the brink of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what transpires from the boundary zones can be very instructive in relation to the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not weird or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when women's rights are threatened around the world in which there is a president in the White House who has been boasting women sexually assaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most dreadful aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') is not the graphic images, the intricate body and the extinct eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (even with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their growers want them to feel humanely that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, taken to the point when it comes to their" "" "personalities" "", "the robots are not real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no communication or background story, nothing that hinders independence or anything that could interfere with the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are false slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the Speaking of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of a healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">It became a truism of the Trump Era that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate have also split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers with advice in the US about how to deal with the horror of Trump-selecting relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all supposed to strain all of us to burst our filter bags.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of Trumps to bring together families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-minded poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone who knows them, including the republican relationship with which she struggled for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite strange on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">It is certainly a good thing around the dining table, but it is important to me that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalisation" and "Trump," we refer to the spooky possibility that his kittens will not be expelled one day.</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans of the right wing are "normalized," which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison with its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Today I find myself surrounded by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both in comparison to Trump in fact occur as a very mild criminal offence.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels of the New York park department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormously large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are knurled and the animals twist to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the perpendicular music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines become familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not quite across the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the theme-pub ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not counting - but a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park carousel is still a strange magic experience, since here two two-year-old, a 11-year-old and two women can go on it in the 40 "s and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to pay the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This does not only lead to a slowdown of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was apologetic, while I was tired of making my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius with chest pain removed from prison to hospital</seg>
<seg id="2450">For the second time, Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year, he was taken to the hospital because of the treatment of sleighs and suffered the prison authorities in his cell after a fall.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistorius was sentenced to a first death sentence because of murder after an appeal by the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning of Valentine's Day 2013 by firing it several times through a door of the toilet cab in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius said he kept his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder who hid in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time to the six-year custodial sentence of Pistorius Appeal, from which they say that it is too transparent.</seg>
<seg id="2456">"" "" "" "the national law enforcement agency said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal can be heard this year." ""</seg>

<seg id="2469">The hens danced with the young Gockeln, who bore the cylinders to the bet.</seg>

<seg id="2471">The young is different from the other kittens (chicks), but belonged to it.</seg>

<seg id="2491">How exactly does the software update take place?</seg>
<seg id="2492">Do diesel drivers need to participate in the promotion?</seg>
<seg id="2493">The most important questions and answers at a glance.</seg>
<seg id="2494">At the diesel peak, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.</seg>

<seg id="2536">The position is already written out - but suitable candidates are rare.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Wacker Stadtbaumeister has been a city builder for 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work is still great fun for him as he communicates in the press conference.</seg>
<seg id="2539">He reports from varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his followers.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, it is surprising that so far no application will fulfil the requirements profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">So - taking notice of the regular periods of notice - should be enough time for a familiarization.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach works as an auxiliary building authority for the administrative community, the applicant must provide appropriate conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="2544">For this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If they could no longer fill them, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for consultation.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But closeness to the citizens is important to the city and itself, says Wacker, who reports from a good working climate and a good mood among the authorities and citizens.</seg>

<seg id="2556">"" "" "" "you can move a lot," "" "said Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors." ""</seg>
<seg id="2557">As the Old Town as an ensemble is under monument protection, it is important to "have an eye on what fits in" when new buildings are approved, the outgoing urban master builder emphasizes.</seg>
<seg id="2558">Anyway, the Stadtbaumeister has a great responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="2559">"" "he is a builder," "" "in the end everything runs here over my table." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2562">Continuity is not only important for a good working climate, but also for the further development of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2563">Those who want to bury Roland Wacker should have studied architecture as a diploma engineer or a bachelor's degree in architecture according to the city of Haslach and have good technical knowledge in the fields of building planning and planning permission.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study says exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable state, which affects about 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the United States, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While the sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan by proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the gut patrol to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in the food do not penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging delicate tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the equilibrium tends too far in the direction of inflammation, an inflammatory bowel disease can result from this.</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have shown that a kind of tolerance stimulates the immune cell in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a bacteria species - Lactobacillus reuteri - a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan encourages more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus, if the same system works among men.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance than it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe that had been separated, but had not.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiomes of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice's intestines were DNA-sequenced and six bacterial species were found that were present in mice with the immune cells, but without the mice lacking them.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were wound up in a sterile environment, so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they were given the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria worked on the immune system, the researchers led L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then conducted small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as idol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that humans have the same tolerant cells such as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts protect.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans like in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan values can lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. reuteri. "</seg>

<seg id="2676">At that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the State of Baden-Württemberg bought two thirds of the subsidy amount.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "success project" - finally, it is important to promote interior development and not only to open up new areas of construction.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On 4 April we received the information from the Government Presidency of Karlsruhe that there will be a rehabilitation area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The subsidy amounts to 833 333 Euro, of which 500 000 Euros would come from the country, the rest of the community felt.</seg>

<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs.</seg>

<seg id="2718">The helicopter made in Connecticut was shown next to a yacht from Maine, a Wisconsin firefighter car and a forklift from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a questionable order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Navy Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operation of the helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed, a second crew for the return flight would be required due to the limitation of the service hours.</seg>

<seg id="2863">Did the PSG Barcelona warn of Neymar three years ago?</seg>
<seg id="2864">The page of La League may interest your interest in Marco Verratti</seg>
<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain will not indulge in its persecution by Neymar after giving an offer of £189 million to trigger its release clause, but did it warn Barcelona three years ago before the world record event?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has halted the transfer window in summer, as the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds.</seg>
<seg id="2867">After finishing, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest-paid professional sportsman in the world. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week.</seg>
<seg id="2868">Barcelona is furious about the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source near the Catalans Board insists that the club has always done its best to take care of him since his arrival in Santos in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2869">But was the soccer world warned three years ago by the PSG president before this prospect?</seg>
<seg id="2870">When Manchester City expressed interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of PSG's best players.</seg>
<seg id="2871">"I'm not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players, we'll be in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.</seg>
<seg id="2872">"we respect all clubs.</seg>
<seg id="2873">"" "but if they try to let one of our players sign in, it will have consequences." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2874">Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, whereby the Spanish association expressed interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.</seg>
<seg id="2875">PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International of Italy to travel under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their prices for Neymar.</seg>

<seg id="2879">The police are witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.</seg>
<seg id="2880">Because he had a car in his lane, the driver had to dodge a VW Touran and toured the guard rail.</seg>
<seg id="2881">On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old came from Rehburg-Loccum with his VW at 7: 55 a.m. on the B 215 from Stolzenau in the direction of Leese.</seg>
<seg id="2882">In the area of the urban surrounding of Stolzenau, he met a car in his lane so that he had to move to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2883">The Touran driver toured the guard rail.</seg>
<seg id="2884">There was a lot of damage to cars on the car.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The driver of the coming car, a Mercedes Benz, had overhauled a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident.</seg>
<seg id="2886">According to the accident damage it can be good that the Mercedesdriver had not noticed the accident at all.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen's report relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the misuse cases relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the misuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weizder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church," announced after publication in front of the German press agency, he received an apology from the former bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the master master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emerized Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would be very useful for the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their then false estimation of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican newspaper" "" "Osservatore Romano" "" "criticized, on the other hand, that the reporting of violence at the Domspatzen" "" "is measured with" "" "double standards" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">In terms of the assaults in Regensburg, no one doubted that it is a "shameful and shameful act" that would have to be punishable and prevented in the future; however, the author Lucetta Scaraffia, Historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics committee, is striking.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," "" "writes Scarf." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis also said in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "we like to go to the church and this is a devouring fresco."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "she also pointed out that in her youth" "" "Strikes were a normal pedagogical means" "" "to be finished with happy children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They found it unfair to apply today's standards to past decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports about the abuse, pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "completely wrongly, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who with Ratzinger summarized the" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take shelter from Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is the 440-page report presented by the German lawyer Ulrich Weber from the diocese of Regensburg?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen became victims of attacks, 67 domesticates sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s "with high plausibility."</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary it can be said that master master R. R. in many cases employed forms of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially in the case of high emotionality, the punishment for the students could be even more violent.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "in contrast to many other accused, many victims nevertheless estimated the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even combine positive memories with him despite violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the misuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger views his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the incidents of violence against protective charcoal at Regensburger Domspatzen, "is a contradictory picture of Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">For one, many students highlight his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears as cholery and perfectionist, who became more tangible to the Öfteren, when a domicile did not bring top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger appears at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">There are eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or co-knowledge in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the preparatory school also occurred outside of its sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">It is possible to blame him at best, to experience it too late, or to have taken initial indications not seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the Domspatzengymnasium, on which it worked, was felt by virtually all respondents as" "" "redemption," "" "heaven" "" "and" "" "better world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">The broad majority of Georg Ratzinger's broad majority also presents a very excellent testimony, "sincerely," "sincerely," "sincerely," "sincerely," "competent" and "understanding," as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and "always surrounded by children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which led to flood breaks.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he did not only knead with chairs and threw the keyring on the floor, but also parted the slap and attracted too naughty boys to the hair or ears, he even admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for this.</seg>
<seg id="2921">It must be said, however, that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable period, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced that in a secular school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the pre-school, these are certainly bagatelles.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders if it is not to do with his acquaintance and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media just fell on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Many people who have never understood him are still working diligently on the Bavarian pope.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, in connection with the report a lot was reported about the subject of misuse at Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger placed in the final report any involvement or co-knowledge with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to be entrusted with the master of the cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," "" "said one of those affected," "" "It was all very embarrassing for me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with the clarification of sexual abuse has been and is, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and brothers, then certainly not a choral director who, professionally, would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen disciples judge Ratzinger's role with regard to the misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable pupil formulated it: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely knowledge and could have been able to stop the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... even for truly absurd to assume that it was calculated... To have opened more intrusive or clearer or even more, than to their parents, dormitory managers, trusted teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "in this way, the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "that students and / or their environment affected him in the run-up could not be confirmed during the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is thus acquitted of any participation.</seg>
<seg id="2943">He cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to link its good name to these vile crimes, as it unfortunately happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media there was a great deal of" "" "nonviolence" "" "at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "watching" "" "in the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that in the coverage everything was mixed and mixed up to a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, right in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is in turn a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is, namely, cleanly separated: between the pre-school and the secondary school of the cathedral-cats, between sexual abuse and violence and, we say once, other precursors.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report covers incidents from the period since 1945, so also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral director of the cathedrals.</seg>
<seg id="2952">All the horrible investigative pedagogy, the cases where boys of sadistic teachers were rigged and maltreated, and among them horribly suffering, were all at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where real scandalous conditions had to be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But the master builder Georg Ratzinger didn't have anything to do with them, because he didn't get the boys to face when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on this, as most of the witnesses stated, was taboo subject to" "" "pre-school" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">It was only fortunate to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was indeed discipline, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" "" "many victims cherished the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even combine positive memories with him despite violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">At most it remains the reproach to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">Yet despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported from the states at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he had just started to establish himself and from the events at a school where he wasn't working and was responsible (so the witness) didn't want to hear anything, and then only back in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Does Georg Ratzinger consistently shut the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out" "" "that in the pre-school the test penalty should continue to be practised." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">In view of the danger of negative press release, he recommended an urgent intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was, as test penalties were also banned in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they took place in a legal grey area, as each of us still knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to assess where the affected people might be exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permitted limit had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">It just doesn't.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 it was officially abolished in schools in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis states that it is unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hesemann:" "" "we historians talk about the" "" "fall-knck of anachronism" "", "i.e. the danger of judging the past with today's moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is already right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was horrible at all times and also not for what was breached in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond that at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all horrible and I am happy that it will finally be worked out.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take shelter for Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Its means of disciplining and punishing, so to draw ear-files and to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was banned, it was strictly adhered to.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "which picture of his time in Regensburg has Georg Ratzinger reproduced in the conversations with you for the book" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of testing capital punishment in this regard as well?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, that the cats only played a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I don't know that he led a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said: without this perfectionism, without demanding unconditioned discipline, it would have hardly been possible for him to form an institution of world trang from the hitherto rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candy alone, one does not play a great singer and a great singer before every success, regardless of the area, but always discipline, passion and overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of person did Georg Ratzinger experience in the conversations with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work in the book and beyond, I met Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, basic, deeply believing and heart-good people, of whom one could not imagine that he could only hurt a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly receive, like many former domescats today, 23 years after his listing, regular contact with him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who did not forgive him until this day, that he was once stern to them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Today most of the cathedrals are grateful to him for enriching their lives and sharing the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, sure, that may be - but also a lovable respect for respect to which they still look and honor them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, again quite clearly: all that is presented to it are educational methods that were the order of the day at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have overcome this time long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is most unfair, a man just because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intent that is behind it, all too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report that has just been published relieves it.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the stand-up, a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without those outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace.</seg>
