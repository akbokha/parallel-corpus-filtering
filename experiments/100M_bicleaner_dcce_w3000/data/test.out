28 @-@ year @-@ old chef found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the stair@@ well of a local grocery shopping centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he can &apos;t imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , it went up again with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ p@@ se found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , serving the medical department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and the investigations are running .
the victim &apos;s brother , Louis Gali@@ cia , told the ABS station K@@ GO in San Francisco , that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had his dream job as a cook at the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed on the ground &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time with Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gali@@ cia stated that Frank was initially living in host@@ els , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things went up for him at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; shared Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO .
Louis Gali@@ cia said he could not imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a big heart .
his way of combining with his family was to always cook something to prepare us for dinner , &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia .
he never wanted to take part in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the river .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ ground diamond shining brigh@@ tly every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information about the case will be asked to call the interim telephone number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m getting stuck in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston doesn &apos;t always have to be perfect or successful .
the Hollywood star in an interview is now unmistak@@ ably clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m getting stuck in drawers or stuck from outside labels that have little to do with me and reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ estly , these things are rather sn@@ u@@ ff to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as explained in the current Cos@@ mop@@ olitan region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the act@@ ress likes to spend her time at home , with a TV with a lo@@ cker@@ ish de@@ bris and Mexican food , in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a children &apos;s game , &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs with us as of August 25 .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sport pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger visited with some colleagues a bit of di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses rec@@ alled their evening , they drove home to the feeding trou@@ ghs in a quick gal@@ lo@@ p .
one kilomet@@ re at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and so the riding career ended up again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was again near horses .
he let himself lead his family over the system of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even bo@@ ther for photographic purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and there@@ with also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sporting aid presented the man from Schaff@@ hausen in the framework of a small gala in the Golden Sports Pyr@@ amid .
the li@@ ke@@ able ath@@ lete has no shortage of awards .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silver lau@@ rel leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the Year ...
even the British Queen had already ad@@ sor@@ bed him .
long is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid .
in Aachen , on Saturday he met Hans Günter Win@@ kler &apos;s first prize winner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is awarded not only for athle@@ tic successes but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting junior employees .
and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ time US master winner was added to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame des deutschen Version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the gymn@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob driver Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the Spring@@ reiter Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the hand@@ ball Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company emig@@ rated to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza price ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ um@@ ps Economic Policy in Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
the two U.S. pres@@ idents , however , are un@@ divided in tax and energy policies as well as in a fundamental issue .
the difference in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophical distinction .
the one about the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump is in doubt rather small and cau@@ tions about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wanted to control the economy and regulate it to death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will dras@@ tically withdraw regulations , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state has certain tasks to fulfil , it has to open up dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money for it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why taxes for the rich would increase , they say .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure .
in the need to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton are almost wor@@ rying .
the democratic applicant is even announc@@ ing the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
government investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly denied by the state @-@ critical Te@@ Bonap@@ artist wing of the Republi@@ cans .
therefore still party internal discussions could come to Tr@@ ump .
the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident .
pump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive the coal mining to the US again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oil production should also be possible in protected areas so far , he wants to cancel the Paris climate protection agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to extend the renew@@ ables &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; renew@@ ables &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its investment program : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in the infrastructure - even when it comes to international trade agreements , the two competitors are not far from each other .
both T@@ PP , the Trans @-@ Pacific Trade Agreement , do not want to sign them .
at the same time , both , however , do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but simply want to better protect American jobs .
they should also be paid better , says Clinton .
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a hunger @-@ wage .
he wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to be up , then he says he must not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
on the one hand , Tr@@ ump is standing , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth .
his critics observed him , so that the budget deficit would only be greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least the rich want them to pay more taxes , and whose critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
escape : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence is part of everyday life for women who are fle@@ eing alone .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed .
a house offers shelter .
in a large kitchen , four women sit .
each one has a baby at the most one year old .
one has placed her little son in her arm .
he looks curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is being watched .
she s@@ miles and kis@@ ses the little one .
the scene is normal .
until you talk with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the division manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social aid services in Bavaria , and is concerned with the topic of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are refugees .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few de@@ centralised accommodations for women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs opened the facility together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich women &apos;s aid .
it has been officially opened recently .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - even not as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of war because they are persecuted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death or because their families send them to Europe as a hope for hope . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in women , other reasons predomin@@ ate : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal away from it because they see no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , volunte@@ ering , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
that drives them away .
on the run , this goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that tu@@ g@@ boats for example require a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever believes that the end , as soon as she comes to Germany , is mistaken , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
here too , single women in refugee camps would often be considered inferior and ab@@ used in the worst case .
this leads to approximately 90 percent of women who live in the housing in the north of Munich are traumati@@ zed , they appreciate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are used to saying nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they dare not speak openly about what they have experienced because the shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know to help , it needs more accommodations just for them , says B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question of whether they knew about a similar project like Munich in their sphere of jurisdiction , some answer with no .
there is no such thing in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz region and Ober@@ fran@@ ken in such a way that there is no such thing in the governments &apos; lod@@ g@@ ings .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia , only escaped women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia , there are floors or houses for single women and their children in some community shel@@ ters .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations only for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommod@@ ated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of privacy , or are men and women accommod@@ ated together , it may be - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women , is included in the study .
how much the women feel this need for protection can be read out at the drive to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we &apos;ve talked about it , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily set up a second house .
assistant physicians argue : demands for new working class measures
assistant physicians have called upon their union to appro@@ ve new labour campaigns in their dispute regarding a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more labor campaign activities from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that ministers would have agreed to respond to the concerns about the contract .
assistant physicians and medical students voted in July on the rejection of a contract which was agreed with the B@@ MA .
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in favor of the elections .
in a letter to the members published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had persist@@ ently left to problems , which led to the rejection of the Treaty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Board has agreed to completely reject the proposed new contract and solic@@ it official ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ations for all your worries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today submitted a formal request to a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating labour campaign that commen@@ ces at the beginning of September .
the li@@ tig@@ ations led to the fact that assistance physicians argue this year six times , the first overall out@@ ages in the history of the N@@ HS .
Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , Head of the B@@ MA Regi@@ stra@@ r , res@@ ig@@ ned after the election to reject the agreed terms of the contract , which had been recommended by the B@@ MA .
he shared B@@ MA members during the sessions that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 resident doctors and medical students , that the contract was beneficial and should be accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t , said that the contract for doctors in England would be forci@@ bly introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands and announce an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counter@@ part in the gold @-@ plated hall of St. Petersburg Palace , I can not resist the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most .
there was a hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile seemed to be pal@@ p@@ able and he hardly radi@@ ated warmth , even for his restra@@ ined conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; love friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan was so ben@@ ign as if something bad had never happened .
it seemed to me that his enthusiasm was rather the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radiant , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the shot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was ra@@ ging .
Putin shared and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia .
the crime was even greater , as it was done by a supposed friend .
re@@ building the ve@@ to becomes difficult , if not impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media launched a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
most serious were the alleg@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan had benefited his own family from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdo@@ gan that he wanted to hear .
Russia was able to book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he has been reli@@ eved of almost his office last month with a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean .
this week , the State television forec@@ asted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ dem@@ sti put it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes are long here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious at the West , as it regards its reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this includes the continuing gru@@ dge on the sn@@ ail emp@@ ower of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara for ensuring that after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat , he demanded support for the elected state organs .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change .
the summit meeting in this splendid palace on the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to portra@@ y an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; as an analy@@ st once described : two countries that viol@@ ate the West and feel badly treated and now unite .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played the role of peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks both pres@@ idents informed that they had not even stri@@ pped the subject .
the president of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences while Putin decided to stress them .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and considering the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey dropped the Russian combat jet - it is certainly better that the two He@@ ads of State are at least once again talking to each other .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside of Scotland
according to the Bank &apos;s chief executive , the R@@ BS label is only to be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland with the fact that the R@@ BS label was associated with the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the bank has dist@@ anced itself from being almost collap@@ sed and res@@ cu@@ ed eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; during this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts have used &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to protect other end consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to put more emphasis on national brands .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralised head office and stock quotes are changed to Nat@@ West .
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller stamps for private customers that will get more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
during a sightseeing tour by customers and employees , Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand becomes our investor brand and the brand among which our employees will be busy as we are now becoming more of a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I now say that we have no global goals , but pursue local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers among these brands .
R@@ BS has already stated that it will not continue to sponsor the Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in his sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to become a bank of brands , as we focus inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands .
but with our work , focusing on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come .

D@@ ett@@ ori sparkling champagne in a double near New@@ market , which brings 3.@@ 000@@ th win
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday .
he set a milestone at Pre@@ dil@@ ection , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local race track with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey that reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he succe@@ eds Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar before , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I ended up here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday night with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori pi@@ cks up the che@@ er when he wins victory on Pre@@ dil@@ ection
two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who scored more than 4,@@ 300 wins in a record breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 car@@ eers
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of Moder@@ nis@@ m and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone , which only few have reached before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intell@@ ect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charism@@ a thri@@ lled fans for years for this sport .
I told Frank@@ ie some weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already gotten 6,000 gains if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and Grand @-@ Tournam@@ ent Jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already ri@@ dden nearly 30 years in the UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve writ@@ able .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and won a prohibition of drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three years ago , he had difficulties when he returned from his six months of lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and return to his top shape .
and he is not at the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his age of at least 5 .
Russian Putin fires Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expect@@ edly dismissed Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov &apos;s chief of staff .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V has been part of Putin &apos;s closest trust for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Repres@@ entative for environmental and transport affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin , Mr Putin ordered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the release Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration without giving reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been an actu@@ ator since 2012 , has been appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in the Estonian capital of Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy .
on the website of the Krem@@ lin , it is called ( in Russian ) that he later was the director and Chief of Staff of the Government Staff .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is the government &apos;s most important task to support your activity as head of state concerning bills and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin informed the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov had asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are the smiling faces convincing ?
Moscow has made this step mysterious .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was for a long time one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest confi@@ d@@ antes and works as he did for the Soviet Intelligence Service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ ig@@ ned at his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so here is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows that at the moment .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once was promoted as a potential president - would like to lead Russian environmental policy - met with great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks on Putin , quoted on the website of the Krem@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - to confi@@ de in embarrass@@ ing posts for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and , like Putin , former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin reached power , he named Ivan@@ ov one of five people whom he trusted the most .
it was once believed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia , because Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution for a third term .
but this post was taken by another , close allies of Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son took part in a physical examination on set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series announced their dis@@ mis@@ sal in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his notice .
there were artistic differences and differences of opinion on the set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the character Gi@@ bs@@ ons from the series that follows a team of FB@@ I agents will be published , according to the opinion of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , is expected to be published at a later date .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who had previously played in the Sit@@ com D@@ har@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been involved since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and put my whole heart blood in the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was hoping to be there until the end , but it won &apos;t be possible anymore .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans who can only wish for a series .
the planned radi@@ ance of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 .
puzzles for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a resident of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks it could be about Sand@@ a@@ ale on the 75 fish that were picked up by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
crossing Que@@ ens@@ ang Crossing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings with the vi@@ a@@ duct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling blo@@ wers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 ski@@ ve ropes .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Kei@@ th Brown already paid a visit to the construction site and was one of the first to go to the Bridge from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment when building Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witness@@ ing an engineering art of a truly epic extent in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ a@@ duct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit .
in total , nearly 79 % of the whole deck of the deck are at their place and the last section of the deck is given a g@@ ong for the deck today in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , project manager at For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this fantastic project the closure is pioneering construction and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last layer of road and its connection with the northern tur@@ m@@ deck located in the expansion , we had to close the still existing gap on the north or side of the country .
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters in the south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
mas@@ sively , since the vi@@ a@@ duct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs approx . 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3 % .
delicate as the tolerances on which the team were working , they were tiny - on each side they ru@@ ined only a few millimeters .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown from fishing boats to Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station sounded an alarm on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming while their boat moved on from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and put the worst off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luckily the strong winds have already fle@@ ed the boat out of their reach , until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed by a local fishing boat while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and hang@@ ed on a bu@@ o@@ y without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Jones : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men thrown into the water have fortunately un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bo@@ ating engine had an emergency stop , but this was released when the boat was scra@@ ped off the person who ste@@ ered the boat .
someone has watched over these men today .
severely injured - man obe@@ ys his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked and severely injured his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife .
as the police informed yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had gotten the key to the apartment to get his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
instead , the alcoholi@@ zed perpet@@ r@@ ator cut off his ex @-@ girlfriend &apos;s clothes .
when she came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by the hand and on the body .
the police could arrest the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed his ex @-@ girlfriend &apos;s clothes , he called his mother .
she then al@@ armed his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she couldn &apos;t move him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .
on the road they met the ex @-@ life @-@ partner of the man .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who builds favor@@ ably priced apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens say that investors should be taken much more strongly in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that in the next few years , Brun@@ swi@@ ck will lose nearly 1300 inexpensive apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Concept of Action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the next council meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but stri@@ fe is programmed .
first of all , the question is : who should build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to build on urban areas , 20 percent of all apartments will have to exhibit as social housing in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the favorable dwell@@ ings can also arise in the stock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big issue in the town hall is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such surfaces , but as much as 20 percent of the housing as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing subsi@@ dy programme that will cost millions of dollars and will still have to be financed will provide incentives for incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , Brat@@ mann says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few rules as possible .
the left wants to impose tough@@ er conditions for investors .
regardless of the situation , the situation in the housing market is escal@@ ating .
if the concept of action is implemented , this will provide additional tasks in the construction management .
more staff is required .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the programme is not yet complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how do you reconci@@ le the loss of further around 1300 low @-@ priced apartments , whose promotion will exp@@ ire in the coming years ?
by 2020 alone there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm , should now be bought out @-@ out bonds from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought of bringing apartments back into the price binding .
this is possible in the western city .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
in the western city , dead@@ lines run out at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments could be picked up there in the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : they do not want the owners , the housing associations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the number of social housing in the western city is dras@@ tically increased , it is removed from the goal of so @-@ called mixing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there should be no more concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens reck@@ on that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D vice @-@ president Holger Her@@ sch@@ ke : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise cannot be found .
Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go , a ch@@ ase for health and happiness that is worth it
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
teenagers and children don &apos;t go outside to play outside , but rather prefer spending their free time with star@@ ing on screens , in the last decade of many compl@@ aining .
Po@@ k@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and last on smartphones .
it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
of course , I refer to Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s ( later derived from a carto@@ on series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
like many pop culture phenomena , interest in the game was falling in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July .
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that the servers over@@ loaded .
within a few days Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Po@@ k@@ é@@ m@@ ons which are tra@@ cked with a GPS and , once they have been found , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( using a screen@@ shot on the mobile ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the del@@ usion and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the U.S. , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person re@@ stores each day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Car@@ di@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , who pursued 3@@ 5.000 users , recently informed the Washington Post that within two days of launching the game , the number of subsequent people who exercise every day 30 minutes , j@@ umped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go - it just sees the raw data for improving performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns for health , people want to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come down from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be active every day &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because many public messages are boring and come from people looking mis@@ erable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sports cannot be over@@ rated .
anyone who regularly drives sport reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here .
but the wonderful thing about Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even join new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
as usual , there are also some stor@@ my per@@ ish@@ ers , who always have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what should it do ?
a breakthrough came into being .
even though Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ bit could already track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sports as this game does .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will fade away with time .
however , due to Po@@ k@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and help many people hunting , more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ thier .

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es creates gold in the gymn@@ as@@ tics
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all that .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
eff@@ or@@ tless on the beam .
st@@ unn@@ ingly on the ground .
all the way brilliant .
and now finally the Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast cl@@ utter@@ ed on Thursday for the title of the campaign and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all the eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her total score of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team @-@ team A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alli@@ st Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is on the balance beam during the single multi @-@ campaign of women in the gymn@@ as@@ tics at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ o is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who wins a multi @-@ campaign title and is the fifth as she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her end result was shown and her long journey at that moment was ending .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years of her sport , 15 world champion med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Rett@@ on told her that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
she expected it to be a final exam in Brazil , a competition that was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be seen as disappointment .
the American act@@ resses Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , on the left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the single multi @-@ stage competition of women in the gymn@@ as@@ tics at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es won the first medal on Tuesday while she served as an ex@@ clamation mark on the f@@ arewell party of the retired man@@ na cur@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although Bil@@ es insist@@ ed that , during their long journey to the top , never planned the future , that is not really true .
part of their soil exercises - containing their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
this is no coinci@@ dence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans &apos; mother during a school excursion in the gymn@@ asi@@ um , was exercised in the Bo@@ or@@ man .
since the summer of 2013 , she has lost no more competition competition , a winning stre@@ ak that will last as long as Bil@@ es wishes .
even though Must@@ afa was slightly led by two turns , the picture was dec@@ ep@@ tive .
aerial beams and soil gymn@@ as@@ tics - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title of the world - were l@@ ur@@ king .
she recovered again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the balance beam - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground another on it .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently as she expected her grand@@ son - a pure form@@ ality - and tears poured in bright red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her book @-@ book became a reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a ven@@ ge@@ ance for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place , but the bronze medal went to Must@@ afa in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke .
this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , who is called &quot; Grand@@ ma &quot; by the Americans , had a lead .
after her exercise , she threw the audience to the public , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed doub@@ t@@ ful .
as regards Bil@@ es , the rapidly expanding T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a whole new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims shot in the car when listening to music in series production
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot who have been killed in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first series killer , while they stopped in the car and listened to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12th , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator fired eight shots from a fire@@ arm , while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle , to read in the report .
the police told us that the triple murder did not seem to be the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , because the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 which were owned by one of the adult victims .
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said the shooting led investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they were connected with four previous attacks .
a total of seven people were killed in nine attacks during the period of four months and two others were injured .
&quot; it is happening in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; says Howard der K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month .
it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to their injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting which picked up an empty Pick@@ up truck half an hour before tri@@ pled murder and assumed that it was the work of serial killer .
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ age sleeves and secured a ball out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 year old with micro@@ cephal@@ ic : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it gets better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and , of course , his mother .
but as the least of its anti@@ qui@@ ties Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder affecting his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during her pregnancy did not know anything .
when he first came home , my first thought was , I didn &apos;t manage that .
I don &apos;t manage that .
I did not let myself go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is not right at all -- of course , one has left for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alize him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund was neither able to sit nor craw@@ l up to his third year and he still can &apos;t speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund has thought of &quot; Please sing something to me . &quot;
&quot; we bring him a sign language , &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News told .
but it is not a typical sign language -- says it . Ed@@ mund has invented some signs alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as in Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and progn@@ oses may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of those infected with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to rec@@ alls the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly wonder@@ ed what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still does not know .
I didn &apos;t ask for the pro@@ g@@ nosis any more for a long time because I didn &apos;t expect it to really tell me someone .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of babies with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rainf@@ alls , floo@@ ding gives rise to b@@ ail@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call on the emergency stand on Friday .
numerous rivers in the south @-@ east of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi floo@@ ded their shores and threatened with large @-@ scale floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , the National Weather Service reported .
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards said that civil servants are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the way to the communities affected .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for flood vessels , boats and sand bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that only the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa would have requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used over large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service announced that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches could fall in rain .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood warning system was used on Friday as it continued to rain in the mobile area .
the River Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the Am@@ ite River near Den@@ ham Springs , both of which are located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , are likely to reach record levels over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses near the vicinity of Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers only slowly flow into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as through the tro@@ dden rivers .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , already reached the highest level on Friday at 09.@@ 00 , which was ever recorded .
rescue teams still sent people out of the flood water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the south @-@ west of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , greatly increased overnight .
he said that another step@@ son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water stre@@ amed and poured in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife told Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years in which she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members would have all obstruc@@ tions and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that all three had saved all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flood had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quickly spread &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it continued to have heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities would be considering ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer announced near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the ground by the rainf@@ all has been considerably balanced since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ alls and floo@@ ding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and classroom failure in five districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that there were 200 floo@@ ded houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches , which were now both floo@@ ded .
the leader of the Rob@@ by Miller community said the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets that were r@@ ins@@ ed by floods .
in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency lod@@ g@@ ings were created to accommodate the ev@@ ac@@ uation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water begins to go back , they will be able to go back to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of roads were closed due to the floods and sand@@ bags were provided for the residents to take part , hoping to keep the water from their houses and shops .
&quot; the last major in@@ undation we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration .
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast .
according to his statements a handful of houses were reported to be floo@@ ded on Thursday , but on Friday no reports have been reported .
Kei@@ th Tow@@ n@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has lived in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tow@@ n@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s still coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; crossed by spheres , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia
the police announced that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time a six @-@ year @-@ old child was shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown for C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several shot injuries , including in the loin , leg , arm and belly , but that he was aware of his transportation to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his small body has been perfor@@ ated by spheres , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family informed the transmitter that he is expected to recover .
he would have started the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical condition , shot dead , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were just investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpet@@ rators .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seemed to have come to a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
cartridge shells for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were trac@@ ed back to different assault ri@@ fl@@ es , over@@ looked the scene .
it seems that this is clearly a continuing struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , there were seals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it seems that there are several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said polic@@ emen Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the broad@@ ca@@ ster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles met in the area .
it did not come to any det@@ ain@@ ees and police are currently re@@ viewing the surveillance video .
on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a j@@ ig@@ saw in front of her house in the residential neighborhood of West O@@ ak Lan@@ e .
she reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I imagine under the women &apos;s Olympics in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that for more than one reason .
first , since 1984 I have been with every summer Olympics and the USA has never been so dominant .
and second , this team has three gymn@@ asts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ din and Ma@@ dison &apos;s Ko@@ cian , the Catho@@ lics , round off , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one female female female female was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman .
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
that shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic Champion and a jubil@@ ee .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they provided unexpected but master@@ ful gy@@ ms routines .
on Thursday Sim@@ one became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won gold in an individual multi @-@ campaign event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but gymn@@ as@@ tics throughout the country do not look like this .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to make it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four female gymn@@ asts in the team . it is also the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that gymn@@ as@@ tics is an expensive sport and gymn@@ asts mainly in private gymn@@ as@@ tics which are maintained by parents responsible for training , teaching , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) .
the majority of these turn@@ tables lie in prosper@@ ous suburbs that can support business .
in these clubs the gymn@@ asts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , trained their athletes since they started the gymn@@ as@@ tics .
we have to give the communities an inn@@ um@@ erable , young girl who are inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie to make a more affordable and easier to access gym training .
I founded my turn@@ sti@@ le of 20 years .
in my events we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young@@ sters ( especially black and His@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics that will make it possible to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport .
gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team , bringing thousands of young girls to care for the gymn@@ as@@ tics , and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the Olympic team square and thank you for motiv@@ ating so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistant physicians want to organize further strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed treaty with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 assistants who voted in favour of a vote refused .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in July Hun@@ t had revealed plans to introduce the treaty , and said that the N@@ HS was in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No Man &apos;s Land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and would be damaging any further delay for the employees and patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first assistance physicians should receive a new contract which includes changes to night and weekend fes@@ tivities in order to improve the care for ongoing hours .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , chair of the B@@ MA Committee for Assistant Physi@@ cians , announced last night in a message : &quot; assistance doctors have still considered serious concerns about the proposed contract , especially that it will heat up the current workforce crisis and fail to treat all doctors . &quot;
with only eight weeks left until the first group of doctors falls under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out .
efforts by the B@@ MA to resolve disputes by means of talks have met with the government on the contrary , and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this happened when Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t made it last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , raise the constra@@ int and address the concerns of the assistance doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do this , the assistants have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further labor campaign activities .
the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were included in order to provide doctors on the strike chain cover .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed treaty with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
the B@@ MA wants a better week@@ end@@ compensation for the 5@@ 4.000 resident doctors who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS employees , called on the assistants to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; working class measures achieve nothing but little , burden already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , nur@@ ses and their families only worries , need and interruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the last two months we have spoken to the Committee of the Assistant Physi@@ cians and responded favor@@ ably to the concerns about tut@@ el@@ age and whi@@ stle @-@ bu@@ stle with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries .
employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as posting , flexibility in training sessions , additional training for those who come back from vocational training , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holidays and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious the employers , Health Education England and the Ministry of Health related to the agreement with the B@@ MA in November , February and May were .
the £ 2 @-@ per Tag@@ - drug that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug after recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti @-@ ageing drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attack .
the N@@ HS regulation authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulation authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
about 14@@ 0,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form floor@@ ings .
when the covering breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots causing the flow of blood to the heart causing a heart attack .
when the blood c@@ lot triggers , it can flow through the blood stream and c@@ logged the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
people who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk to have another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely .
the draft of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Evaluation Center , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing further heart attacks and stro@@ kes with people already having a heart attack .
with a provisional recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years . the pipeline bill recommends no treatment that goes beyond this period .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tness makes election fraud flour@@ ish in Muslim areas
tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man , former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets , was removed from office last year on alleg@@ ations of corruption
a culture of political Cor@@ rec@@ tness has led to widespread election fraud in Muslim communities , ignor@@ ing a devastating government report today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally attacks the police , election ob@@ servers and town halls for ignor@@ ing evidence of mis@@ use due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Minister of Integration and Communal Affairs , now an anti @-@ corruption king , said that the intim@@ id@@ ation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up shut @-@ off tapes outside of electoral cabins to protect intim@@ id@@ ated voters .
he recommends that voters should have an ID card to prove their identity in the elections .
at present , a vot@@ er has to call his name and address .
the report proposes to apply non @-@ removable ink to a person &apos;s finger if they give up their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice .
whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should be more protected , says Sir Eric .
it demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this serves not only for electoral fraud , but also to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud that is associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Dow@@ ning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets election sc@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year , a special electoral court ruled that the acting mayor Lut@@ sen@@ Rah@@ man should be dismissed after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practice of his ministry .
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal manner &quot; and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations .
Rah@@ man allegedly took &quot; his campaign on the ground that it was the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either doub@@ t@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation in which one person chooses to be someone else .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said that there is evidence of fraud throughout the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , he vo@@ iced alarm on the frau@@ dul@@ ent choice of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the guiding of ID cards to prove the identity
in his report it reads : &quot; as evidence , it was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised , in particular women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , in particular communities with a Pak@@ ist@@ ani or b@@ ang@@ lad@@ an background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... governmental institutions ignor@@ antly ignored such behavior because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban that political activists edit letter selection documents in order to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poll@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report that is considered by Ther@@ esa May also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral list being used for immigration and social security purposes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
consider options to ask voters prior to choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has released her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person perform to make sure they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation to requests for an automatic postal code .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bann@@ ing political activists to edit full letter sel@@ ections and envel@@ opes from mail elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police have the authority to set up lock@@ outs for election stations .
a change of legislation which facilitates an accus@@ ation of intim@@ id@@ ation in accordance with the repression of the People Act 1983 ( 1983 ) .
prohibition of photography in poll@@ ing stations .
request that only English can be used in the poll@@ ing stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fying the training to ensure that employees are generally able to asser@@ t that voters go alone in the elec@@ tive cab .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric visits the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets there was no criminal complaint . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral court has declared Lut@@ te Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as useless , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons , it was found guilty - in accordance with the high requirements in the criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ ups &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the election registration departments of the town halls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets of last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country bears a proud heritage as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy for K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ gers from Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio will be amazed by the French cycling activ@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T , who turned out to be an impressive double @-@ head of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ oni@@ ee is by far not the only ath@@ lete who is fighting gold , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not if you are allowed to believe the social media .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ ck@@ ering at the time on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympics that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the h@@ unter and the wolf : team member of the US team at the arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , has been compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood .
besides K@@ ate Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the cycling track , many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher could be the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the US team at the arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see any great simil@@ arity with the exception of facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I take it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her big , expressive eyes is said to be a double @-@ head for the Cuban singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African float Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one course higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another persistent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal s@@ wimm@@ ers Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ fi@@ mo@@ va has more than just the sun @-@ tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American was att@@ ested to Nathan of fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , on the right , have a similar face shape and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others have noticed the simil@@ arities
theory placed in the room : according to this user , there is perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US soccer star Hope Solo and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face @-@ form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons made K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney , as well as the gold medal winner in Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , who has her own beautiful , wide smile that resembles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games exc@@ uses for his statement that Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died as a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Canadian broad@@ ca@@ ster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; like M@@ ief &quot; went off &quot; and died during the race like &quot; a pig . &quot;
the comment@@ ator B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off when he released his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m free @-@ style swimming pool .
Mac@@ Donald , who had been caught on board in the Com@@ mentary team of the C@@ BS , was able to say : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman has lost affili@@ ation , baby . &quot;
too excited , she went as low as a pig .
thank you for this .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming st@@ aff@@ el 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which allowed the Canadian to close the gap to China .
viewers across Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were shocked by the sound and the language .
Em@@ met@@ t Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ eter , &quot; H@@ as the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old s@@ wimm@@ ers from China &quot; die as a pig &quot; ? ? ? ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot has not captured that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai Yan@@ is from China has been described as follows : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman has lost affili@@ ation , baby . &quot;
the cri@@ tique of B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard , many of whom were talking about him .
Twitter @-@ users did not stay back when they heard how un@@ sensitive B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was
&quot; &quot; &quot; another Twitter user Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look like ra@@ cists . # attached .
a short time later , Scott Rus@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comment and said : &quot; we are sorry that the comment about a floating performance was broadcast . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , we are sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC exc@@ used at the end of more than 90 times with the people who responded to the B@@ emer@@ kt on Twitter
the comment@@ ator colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the name of Mac@@ Donald .
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ologies to more than 90 other Twitter users compl@@ aining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and gave a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
yesterday night we quickly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our audience on show and our followers in the social media .
to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ on &apos;s comments related to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not to them as a person .
nevertheless they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ happy choice . B@@ yr@@ on is sorry about what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald was ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the show and tried to justify his re@@ mark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s swimming pool in the C@@ BC Olympics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I referred to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not to them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was inten@@ tional and I am very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area she took a pair of pants from the delivery , pulled off her own pants and pants and tried her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a more discreet spot to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the pants that she obviously did not like , as she put her back into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she did not like her again and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b anyone watching - or thinking about the person who might under certain circumstances buy the pants that she had ta@@ sted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how disgu@@ sting to think that someone would take home har@@ lots that had a different person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident took place on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I got along , the employees have tried to pull out the clothes from the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of pants and find out that another woman had her and went out and did not wash her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday August 9 at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products in question were withdrawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself from weapons attacks with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it more secure for you .
we talked to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Con@@ federation in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at a close distance .
regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn the spe@@ ar around for your rob@@ ber .
when you move from behind you should turn around as first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and move out of the shot , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
then take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before hitting your face with your free el@@ bow .
strike him then with his knee in the chest and twist , while the attack@@ er crum@@ bs against pain , the weapon from his hands . beat him with the barrel into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him .
for attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot , grab the gun and twist it so that the attack@@ er can &apos;t shoot .
shift the weight to the weapon at the same time and hit the attack@@ er on the chest , then twist the gun from its grip before moving backwards and directing the gun to it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that a rob@@ ber@@ y is the saf@@ est way to hand over your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
traveler Ian W@@ right sh@@ ab@@ t for a travel guide his tongue in the dir@@ ti@@ est places of Europe
a British traveler underwent a serious test of his immune system and stran@@ gl@@ ehold by le@@ aking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel writer Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k threw his train on a euro note , a hand@@ rail at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ing toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system .
before the screening of each object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he is going to get .
but the experiment that was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; brought some surprising results .
the idea of det@@ ecting the r@@ ins@@ ing toilet of a train toilet which has been used by thousands of others may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately nothing left what he li@@ cked off , more than a bad after@@ taste in his mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resili@@ ence of his intest@@ ines by travelling through the world and ate strange and wonderful things .
from public v@@ est@@ ments at railway stations to flus@@ hing buttons of toilets , the task assigned its immune system defini@@ tively under a sample
in the film he told : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
in the film he was able to do justice to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial period showed a lumin@@ ometric total of over 4000 units .
compared to this , the lumin@@ ometric rate of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to refuse , after their lumin@@ ance count was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 .
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish producer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different locations such as the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that comes close to the worst I have sm@@ elled in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing worse than that !
I will not lick here , because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , S@@ haf@@ ts and New Categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really wanted to offer something new to the consumers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explain the advantages of pro@@ bio@@ tics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we conducted crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended with saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Call us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the meaning of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary , we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film , added : &quot; let me tell you that - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had ta@@ sted some of the things that I had told him to lick , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet which is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to check them out and others where this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents associated lac@@ tic acid bacteria , in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines , and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
the as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family destro@@ ys before Del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung &apos;s social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left their social housing after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation with a loss of £ 50,000 because they had terr@@ orized their neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing association found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls showed striking holes , wooden plan@@ ks were torn , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was s@@ me@@ ared to the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that they now live in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ vo@@ y , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired .
she said , &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people and I think that people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider as this property is thought to be considered as not so beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror inflic@@ ted by the family had embra@@ ced street fights with bas@@ eball bats , intim@@ id@@ ation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive scre@@ ams , stri@@ kers and flu@@ kes .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , received an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
they were pil@@ ed up in the estate in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past
neighbors said they had to fight them on the street and regularly called the police
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ o@@ ded her and her partner forci@@ bly from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation was che@@ ered by facilit@@ ated neighbours who said that their lives were made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They weren &apos;t afraid of anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we could not sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we weren &apos;t used to that !
now that they are finally gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have missed the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called at regular intervals for 20 years
garbage and old toys were thrown down on the over@@ grown side of the church building
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is a shame that the ten@@ ant will reject all responsibility for their behavior and family , as del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation is always the last step that Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing is considering . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case , as the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be aw@@ ful for their neighbors .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police , as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have given us the information we have provided .
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message conve@@ ys that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation on the floor .
workers of the house administration will now have to swe@@ ep away garbage mountains that surround the house
in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found more than 70@@ g cannabis as well as balances , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine after ow@@ ning the owner of a class B drug in commercial custody .
she claimed that the money was a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in 2013 in a car accident .
after they were without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many room walls of the house were gre@@ ased with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say that they are les@@ see who do not stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row from the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall Police reported that del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation is a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ repro@@ aches as well as to those who have been har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
De@@ von and Corn@@ wall Police will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

sun wor@@ ship@@ pers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal survived the shock of their lives
a Portuguese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft of the Air Force took an incredible flight
the air forces stated that it was on a training flight , but insist@@ ed that there was no safety risk .
this was the moment when the frigh@@ tened tourists started to panic after a pep@@ per@@ y jet crashed on a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew almost in close proximity to the sun wor@@ ship@@ pers on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers j@@ umped when they began to worry about the noise of the nozzle @-@ engines , without first seeing what came through the clouds on them .
the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos on the dramatic Fly @-@ By in social media , said : &quot; it really flew very low twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was surfing and it felt like the plane crashed on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro in panic were set in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly low
the Portuguese air forces announced today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fis@@ her boats off the coast and to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the speaker said that the jet flew slightly deeper than usual due to the bad visibility due to the bad visibility conditions , but the air forces insist@@ ed that safety at no time was at risk .
area fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where also four people on the island of Madeira came to death .
the Portuguese air forces announced today that the pilot had to fly so deeply due to the conditions - strong fog and smoke , which restric@@ ts his view .
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise

the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen vie for the status as number one in Barcelona for two years .
coach Luis En@@ rique reli@@ ed on a clear decision in this regard and left Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most of the rest of the competition .
before the first mandatory match of the new season , the Spanish Master doubts about the fitness condition of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game from Liverpool with 0 : 4 .
also at 3 : 2 in the rehear@@ sal against S@@ amp@@ dam@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. didn &apos;t really convince him .
Sevilla , in turn , has to di@@ gest the 2 : 3 defeat after extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and is aiming for the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
with 11 achievements , Barcelona has so far been the record winner in this competition .
Ma Long in its own league of table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and title defender Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4,@@ 4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in a one @-@ sided finale .
the World R@@ ank@@ ers first won the Golden Grand S@@ lam with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and just Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ zut@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the title among themselves .
it was clear that for the third time in succession a Chinese would pick up the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top of the Olympia @-@ podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sentences and with time @-@ outs they had no coaches with them .
they had withdrawn into the grand@@ stand and left their cont@@ ests alone in a fair competition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the matches until now have I played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang had said rightly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game , gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts posed with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
Ma had really to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first set .
then he determined the tempo on the plate and left Z@@ hang from there only a total of 13 points .
the superi@@ ority of Ma did not develop the expected thrilling match .
nevertheless , there were enough breathtaking ball changes to be seen .
Mi@@ zut@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quarter @-@ final against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an had contracted a ri@@ b violation , and after that he was in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to settle with sheet metal .
the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Pers@@ son ( 42 / 2008 ) have by the way been in similarly high table tennis old Olympia @-@ Vi@@ erte .
Donald Tr@@ ump clean@@ ses &quot; massive problems &quot; in the election campaign
the leadership of the US Republi@@ cans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditionally conservative federal states .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has now weaknesses in his election campaign in the previous republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old U@@ tah .
a rare moment when the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire expressed such concerns as correspon@@ dents reported .
after throwing 16 ri@@ vals out of the race within the own republi@@ can camp , doubts about his success are now growing in the fight for the White House .
&quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump from Evangel@@ ical Christians , who he asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia .
guilt is false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media scene .
republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds are shaking
U@@ tah is normally a secure bank for the Republi@@ cans .
according to a survey conducted by surv@@ ey@@ s. surv@@ ey@@ or from June , Tr@@ ump and his competi@@ tor were equal to the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutes see Tr@@ ump in the front , but not at the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state .
also Arizona and Georgia are considered to be endangered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with the broad@@ ca@@ ster CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump answered the question of how he wanted to stop the rise of Clinton : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as I did it so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either be successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is doing nothing else than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; telling the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , this is fine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party is said to have threatened to eliminate funds to support its electoral campaign , it should not be able to present better surveys .
instead of wanting to strengthen the Republi@@ cans &quot; candidates for Congress , they would be more powerful than the arms .
Olympics : the Thi@@ est Sc@@ am in the Dop@@ ing Test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary committee in the event .
Kenya &apos;s athletes face the second dop@@ ing affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
after an attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a trainer home .
the International Olympic Committee informed us immediately to set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary announced that the former Spr@@ inter and present coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , had submitted a urine specimen in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch .
this was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by the dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF World Association has requested the IO@@ C to obtain information about the case in order to ex@@ ert its own investigations , an IA@@ AF speaker announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the ensu@@ ing measures of the IO@@ C , IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the IA@@ AF explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and spent himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch , signed the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; explained Mr Ken@@ y@@ as Chief of Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in the hands of the accreditation of the ath@@ lete , who was on the list for training controls of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch had become more than 800 metres in Beijing in 2015 .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan Ath@@ le@@ tics delegation leader Michael Ro@@ ti@@ ch had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio games .
he was reported to have informed athletes of his country about pending dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he was said to have been arrested on his return to Nairobi airport .
in Kenya , after numerous dop@@ ing contracts , Kenya has been under special observation since a long time .
at the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by the IO@@ C , more than 2000 dop@@ ing target checks before the Rio games have been noted previously that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are targeted .
before the summer games in Brazil , the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had put much pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the start of the Olympics .
as a result , the WA@@ DA Kenya took from the list of countries whose fight against dop@@ ing is compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a great runner nation .
the athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of television reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations were repeatedly raised that dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a substantial ment@@ ality of sports bet@@ ru@@ gs .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar study in Kenya as he had hired them in the Russian athle@@ tics .
in doing so , it could be proven that in this type of sport was widespread and systematic dimin@@ ished .
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Salzburger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ Year the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic lover couple , like Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with it a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conquest Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece .
the artistic director , Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled a youth space with the role of Mary .
in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that it is Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody .
it is a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have amber music in our blood !
in this production Bart@@ oli plays an older Mary .
she re@@ members with nostal@@ gia to her boy@@ friend Tony , while younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
first , because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so it is wise , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very similar to me , my Italian character , which I used as a Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is such an honor for us to work with it .
it is an enormously generous person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an exceptional artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of its movements , in its bli@@ cks , it &apos;s his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a happy approach to life , that &apos;s very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have the refugees , back then the Irish people went to New York and the New York inhabitants didn &apos;t want it .
they are the same themes , and they are as meaningful today as it was then .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London &apos;s school girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ sk@@ je@@ e said that her family learned about her death a few weeks ago in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the group &apos;s bul@@ war@@ ks in the country , reported I@@ TV news on Thursday .
sul@@ tan was 17 years old and died shortly after her family &apos;s indications of leaving the war @-@ torn country and returning to England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said A@@ sk@@ je@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other girls from the east of London went to a plane in the direction of Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she had married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months .
Rei@@ d says that in the case of election victory at Gar@@ land , Clinton will be the candidate for the Supreme Court
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
Republi@@ cans in the Senate have blocked the country &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the dec@@ eased judge on the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that Clinton expects Gar@@ land to &quot; select &quot; with a certain degree of certainty .
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he had not yet talked to Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulate .
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about un@@ rest with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Court for the US App@@ ell@@ ation Court for the District of Columbia .
RAID said Republi@@ cans have blocked the country &apos;s nom@@ ination , be lack@@ eys and supporters of Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump .
he also noted that Donald Tr@@ ump is in@@ appropriate for the Pres@@ idency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tre@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wants to make nude calendar for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women and Men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tre@@ ats Magazin &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works with the photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere to launch a 1970 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired Calendar for 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his neck magazine of Old@@ school Play@@ boys differ@@ ed because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Play@@ boy for men &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he thinks it does the Calendar too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to return to the depic@@ tion of timeless and classic n@@ ak@@ edness , in which both women and men feel well and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release for the release of the calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally at an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community reck@@ ons with mass flight
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who do not conform and praise Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kurdish community of Germany reck@@ ons with tens of thousands of prot@@ esters who flee from Turkey to Germany at short notice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the chairman of the association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the harsh attachment of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at short notice I reck@@ on with ten thousand , in the medium term with several hundred thousand prot@@ ectors from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the president of the association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government has already covered cur@@ few stron@@ gh@@ olds with sanctions , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds are fle@@ eing within Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the twi@@ sted put@@ sch , there are still secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to restart in Europe if they are to be supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state , which takes refugees itself , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leader of the band accused the deliber@@ ate settlement of Syrian Arab Arabs in Kurdish but also in al@@ vi@@ tic cities .
this would allow Erdo@@ gan to increase the exit pressure to the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradic@@ ated or displaced in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the band demanded that the German government positioned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in Germany , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan @-@ Cri@@ tic is taking place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
more Turks are seeking asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the br@@ anding as Gü@@ len tra@@ ilers destro@@ ys teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; those who do not conform and praise Erdo@@ gan sits on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the K@@ em@@ alists and Sa@@ kul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as reported by the newspaper on the figures of the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks occupied the largest group of asylum seek@@ ers recognised by political persecution in Germany before the coup .
at the reporting date June 30 , these were 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and therefore nearly 29 percent of all recognised as asylum seek@@ ers ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this survey , there is no fighting against war , poverty or lack of prospects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
asylum enti@@ tles according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from state side , individually persecuted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals won &apos;t get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia should not choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
in 2021 , the Parliament &apos;s Parliament elections will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in parliament decided at the beginning of the year .
because stupid as yet it &apos;s not possible : summer holidays , heat and land election campaign - that bit@@ es .
the locals , who are to be convinced by the election fighters , are on vacation .
most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers in the country , on the island of Use@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals , so you are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
there are practical problems : during the holidays there are hel@@ pers who hang up posters , blow up ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers , and count voices in the end , only to gr@@ ind .
until the 4th of September 2016 , the election and last holiday @-@ day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to let go of an election campaign close to the people .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in poll@@ s .
exciting is how strongly newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 heads of government , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from his large posters .
he travels through the country , distri@@ butes ro@@ ses and talks a bit with the people , just as his legendary elo@@ qu@@ ent predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff also did .
apart from that , Seel@@ ow has got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel is the blame for Af@@ D &apos;s blos@@ som@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has accelerated the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the nice office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U , with its peak channel data , the interior minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is if one makes election campaigns at the right place at the wrong time .
she has invited chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to open @-@ air demonstrations twice ; Merkel &apos;s Bundestag election circuit is located in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other German states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is a shame even for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
otherwise , the Nor@@ theast @-@ CD@@ U largely wai@@ ves the usual electoral campaigns on market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this , according to Kok@@ ert , only plays a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union has also noticed that in the country you will crum@@ ble the base , that it has to ex@@ ert itself very much to find a wire to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : hardly available in the wi@@ pes of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the CD@@ U elec@@ tor Kok@@ ert on his comrades is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must go where it hur@@ ts , where people are : thorn @-@ este , Golden weddings , every birthday party must be used &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because there is much stake in the game , S@@ ella has now called for an especially committed election campaign .
in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats last dropped 22 percent behind the CD@@ U ( 25 ) partner , and only just ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the election of 2011 , the SPD had still won a clear 3@@ 5.@@ 6 per cent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , the small party with seven percent in poll@@ s , are likely to make the leap into the Land@@ tag .
they make a modern virtue out of the necessity of holiday and spend their campaign largely on the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she calls the head of the state Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
apart from that , green electoral campaig@@ ners embar@@ k on search for evidence of domestic stim@@ uli among holi@@ day@@ makers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , just cur@@ vy with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and still finds it beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 Rest@@ oration : restaurants suffer from block@@ age
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated .
for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and end only at 20 o &apos;clock , there is all praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they made everything pretty sh@@ ak@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super team .
there is also no delay .
the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything is to be finished .
the opposite is also commen@@ ded for those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to the establishment of temporary expe@@ ditions .
since the construction site was moved to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the asphalt road in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and the connection to Rot@@ tenburg exists again , the traffic situation within the place has eased .
the citizens can now proceed from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 back on both sides .
the transit through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were some considerable complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deputy Head Manager Florian King , responsible for the rehabilitation management of the rehabilitation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ ler@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ terrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many of the cre@@ eping routes were looking for and more familiar with their nav@@ i than the sign@@ age .
what led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas were fran@@ ch@@ ising .
as the speed limits were not met , the congregation challenged the vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; there were considerable transgres@@ sions , &quot; says King , who made himself aware of the situation himself .
two to three per minute have been carved .
the quick@@ est was on the road with 77 kilometers per hour in the speed @-@ 30 zone .
but since the construction site has moved on , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg the road is open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 rehabilitation has led to revenue break@@ through@@ s allows everyone to look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are produced for other companies , for which the renovation has little consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sul@@ z also speaks of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a slight decline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the deal@@ er@@ ship Ma@@ ier too , but also ad@@ mits that of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the balance is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most exploited are the local restaurants along the street .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , the owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential threat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only it , but all the restaurants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit hard &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing .
we must be happy about every euro sales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sales revenue accounts for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road @-@ restoration has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrown back &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to divor@@ ce half of his staff .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , President President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation , with the hint that the restaurant would benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 . now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where so much more gener@@ ously handled .
with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is confident that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , family operations have been settled here since 17@@ 15 , pointing to the long history .
it can be understood that other regular guests are now less frequent due to the complicated traffic guidance .
if you cannot ride , it is also somewhere else beautiful .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt that his family @-@ client@@ ele comes back after the renovation works .
despite the crises with BSE and avian influ@@ enza , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the impact of the B 27 construction on its client@@ ele for the biggest crisis , which has experienced its restaurant in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , that is already brutal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the name of the fight against terrorism , laws are constantly being bol@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a thick security package .
but what has a d@@ ull status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say about all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the conci@@ li@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they do not overwhel@@ m anybody .
other further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
even in this I be@@ g myself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , as Minister of the Interior , he was concerned with results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ cover@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère took a little time before he presented his conclusions for security in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
some things are already known , announced , announced : that a new security agency should take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and ce@@ ase@@ fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère starts a second conc@@ entri@@ c run for proposals not to be made with the SPD until now : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ ck jihadi@@ sts with dual citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U @-@ husband ad@@ mits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still considers this to be reasonable and does not demand anything that has no chance at the coalition partner anyway .
a few new ideas are presented de Ma@@ izi@@ ère as well .
they are part of it : he plans high @-@ speed procedures for deport@@ ations and more opportunities to det@@ ain people from deport@@ ation .
refugees that are targeted to the country must first check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
in the case of exp@@ ul@@ sions for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse than before - for example those who commit criminal off@@ ences or throw away their papers in order to obsc@@ ure their identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of it is politically and legally hei@@ gh@@ tened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of them have also been un@@ mixed and leaves questions un@@ answered .
and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient - for example - raises the question : what does that actually have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects refugees and terror .
but it cannot be denied that the residents of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in addition , in view of the high numbers of refugees , many people were worried about security .
and things that people deeply occupied themselves could not be excluded even during election campaigns .
the inner security has enormously moved into focus .
first the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are election campaigns .
the European Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly assuming their position on the topic of internal security .
in the past few days , the two parties went high .
it is only a secret dispute over the equi@@ pping of the Federal Police , then by a security policy collection of some of the Ministers of the Interior , where the R@@ ess@@ or@@ chiefs also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also struggling here for conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
he keeps nothing from a departure from a double pass .
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
it is not sensible to re@@ charge you .
and in a Bur@@ ka ban he has constitutional concerns .
whether its own package is constitu@@ tionally constitutional and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , must first show itself .
there is a lot in it , which could provide a quar@@ rel .
but also the SPD is currently attempting to benefit from internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Par@@ eich@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel first signals attention to conversation and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen is still flying through .
in spite of diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the delivery numbers are rising worldwide .
but it does not run smoothly in all markets .
in the recall action , there is vor@@ tex about a term .
Volkswagen starts the second half of the year with the deliveries .
despite its many brands and a number of well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can advance a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
however , in July the core brand VW weak@@ ly slow@@ ed down in Western Europe and consequently loaded the total sales , as announced by the company in the D@@ ax .
in July , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer cars than in the previous year with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars .
sales in Western Europe alone , the second most important market in China , remained 14 percent below the prior @-@ year figure .
in Germany &apos;s home market , deliveries declined by almost one sixth .
brand sales manager Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July especially on two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there has been a reluc@@ tance to buy in some core markets through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote for withdrawal from the EU also stressed , explaining a spokesperson .
in the US , where the exhaust gas is escal@@ ating at first , a minus is also available .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
overall , the mainly affected building brand of the Lower Sax@@ ons comes already further through the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months there is only an ex@@ tradition minus from 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles .
group sales Fred Kap@@ pler further showed a sales increase from January to July .
at this time , Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had tam@@ pered with a software exhaust test .
in Germany alone , VW is calling around 2.5 million vehicles to convert into the workshops .
in the course of retro@@ fitting VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after ref@@ itting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the car park offers customers a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate after ref@@ itting , but do not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as stated on Friday in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal partic@@ ul@@ arities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen is now giving its German customers a guarantee for highly @-@ equipped diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Monday , this would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
the Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; VW has fully met the requirements of my Insp@@ ection Commission and the KBA . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deviations from this will not be accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has assumed that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power will not take place after the retro@@ fitting and all type @-@ approved vehicle values remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was said in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that , for example , customers might come to a workshop for half a year after the conversion , for example , and this could lead back to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
in the interests of the customer , it is also important to avoid that any other damage that has nothing to do with the sc@@ andal has to be in@@ secure with regard to possible warranty regulations as it was stated .
therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands extensive savings in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bank chief Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposit accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German B@@ anks speaks of an individual case and does not see a signal in it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savings should not be afraid to pay pen@@ alties for their savings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; banks spend money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fee goes back to Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits of more than € 100,000 in deposits or daily money accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 in the future will cost 400 euros in the year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for some time now , he be@@ ware 40 million euros that could be lifted from one day to another and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie at me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent of costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t lay down for every million 4000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs are now passed on according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter principle .
leaving the cash in the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank counter would be too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve seen four rob@@ ber@@ ies , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! , &quot; said the bank board .
most customers would have understanding and changed to other types of investment .
few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Co@@ operative Association of Bavaria declares : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs for all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to carry it alone is not possible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically viable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their bank account fees , credit cards or bank transfers .
with pen@@ alties for deposits from three million euros , the Thur@@ in@@ gian People &apos;s and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Bank Alten@@ burger Land had made head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael K@@ em@@ mer , chief executive of the banking union , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect that private customers have to pay blanket fees for deposits , and competition in Germany is much too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a client@@ ele which is luxuri@@ ously endow@@ ed with wealth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she be@@ ware of free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , the cooperative bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are currently no other banks known to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ operative Association of Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which charge a le@@ verage rate for private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of June , the President of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banken and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen banks ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go to the negative for private customers is very , very high . &quot;
competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the emig@@ ration of investors to compete .
customers in Germany will not be disappointed by this .
destination plates : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
lonely men middle @-@ aged love plates .
before you w@@ ander to the comment section to see him under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non@@ sensi@@ cal men of the middle ages with rough insul@@ ts , this statement deri@@ ves from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the much discussed re @-@ emergence of records is not attributable to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that want to welcome the news of physical objects but to Mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght according to the age of 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
there is also no hor@@ des of hobby collectors - it has an emotional impact : older record buyers will retain their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending their time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote ?
if this blog was a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , wearing a modest grey suit and stu@@ ffed wild before I stand still , hold my hands and say something better like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even if the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there are still a handful of fantastic record specialist shops .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn the camera off for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to several men in such shops and try to evaluate their age and mind by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , from Si@@ ster Ray ( number of data : two young women , three middle aged men ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of data : eight men middle aged , one woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I guess , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have some 3,000 or 4,000 s@@ labs .
these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t follow him at home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason he has such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and buying items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things in which I was probably something too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink a lot .
that is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers he meets have to apply to You@@ Go@@ v profile .
he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are looking to buy back their old records .
from the conversations that I have led , people usually get rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of the plate revi@@ vals of a particular age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of plates ?
it only takes a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offer a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to the WE@@ Z , some of the older customers took notice of the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to reti@@ re to the stability of familiar record covers , from objects that call for happy che@@ ering .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; says WE@@ Z .
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it &apos;s like that for many people .
it is a simple way to engage spiritually .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an employee fli@@ rts from a record pile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an IC@@ M survey in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to it .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record do not have a record player .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very worried , while browsing through a stack of Bos@@ sa nov@@ a compil@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works with Sounds of the Universe ( number of data : three middle aged men ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone just came here recently and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have record players , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound record so I can put them on the shelf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less musical .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones , who only slowly come in .
F@@ opp , which has dedicated the records to almost a whole floor , has a lower audience than I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age boys and middle @-@ aged women .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s latest syn@@ thesizer and sex @-@ packed pop instead of experimental jazz thunder@@ ous from the loudspeakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks odd , but the mental trauma is hard to find when standing next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the shop for a few minutes and considers the variety of records to be sold .
it makes a window @-@ shopping rather than a big shopping .
it doesn &apos;t deserve much , so collecting disks is not a real option , they say .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or another way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives away with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the impression to pattern the pants &apos; pants &apos; pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls , who group for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a Cros@@ ley turn@@ table .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of records by Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far up that it is impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain about .
it is no surprise that a population group , who has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as plates .
even though my research revealed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they are not taken into account , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the great number of female collectors who exist in reality , record stores and online forums .
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with security not w@@ ander through records of Ber@@ wick Street and sheets , while they ste@@ er from the star@@ ing look of an unc@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false moder@@ ator who over@@ looks the shoulders of nothing of middle @-@ aged men .
the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k is the longest living verteb@@ rate - video face
scientifically , the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k has the longest life span of all verteb@@ rates on the planet .

French Court re@@ jects proposal on demoli@@ tion of businesses in the jungle of refugee camps
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live .
during a trial this week the authorities argued in Cal@@ ais that the state should be authorised to submit 72 temporary shops in which people within the camp sell goods , cigar@@ ettes to en@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell bar@@ ber services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be pulled down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would pose a risk of fire and san@@ ity .
humanitarian groups told the Court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ assisted union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also learned that temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the deport@@ ation of people who operate 72 provisional businesses , but admitted that the concerns raised by the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ju@@ dge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feeding people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the Dutch was the camp &apos;s Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; café dedicated to serving English and French classes along with 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be a catastrophe for these children , of whom the youngest eight years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two relief organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle was increased to over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of newcom@@ ers during the summer .
despite Olympic disappointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant
despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing appearance at the Olympic time , Rad@@ prof@@ i Tony Martin does not want to get under@@ min@@ ed .
&quot; I keep the world cup at a glance , stay confident and fight , &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook .
he has no explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place in the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am honest , it &apos;s hard to comment on the timing of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must analyze in peace what causes the de@@ bac@@ le had led .
at the World Championship in October in Qatar , Martin wanted to fight for the title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything we have changed in the last time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also includes my position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the three @-@ time world champion , who had lost on Wednesday at 5@@ 4.5 km more than three minutes on Olympic champion Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers must adapt to the next generation of speed meas@@ ur@@ ers : in different federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flas@@ hes are tested , which are intended to over@@ run tem@@ pos .
the fut@@ uris@@ tically active reinforcement Tra@@ iler of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on highway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itate bridges with temporary speed pins , there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary bl@@ itz for adher@@ ence to speed limit .
however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts for five days with continuous measurement operations , the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be recorded at the same time across multiple tracks .
variable speed limits as well as access b@@ ans after time , lane and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the state @-@ driven state , the trailer can be moved according to manufacturer with every car with trailer hit@@ ch .
so that it is not easily st@@ owed , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and by the way also sweat @-@ resistant outer she@@ ath disappear .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the bl@@ itz from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .
foreign authorities also flash with the new technology : recently France ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 units last year .
great Britain retri@@ eves silver in the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold gets recovered
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at 7 @-@ 7 rug@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt on Thursday evening at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were struck in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the Pom@@ odoro Stadium .
Fi@@ ji gave a master class in handling , side @-@ stepping , back , line running , and raw power to win gold - its first Olympic medal of any color .
the defeat was lost due to the not too bad tro@@ phy of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the marked defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back on them in the final .
but regardless of that , Fi@@ ji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in this form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for UK - but it will probably not - that at least a Brit@@ on will have a gold medal tomorrow at his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ry@@ an , former head of England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path behind it .
eight years ago , Ry@@ an lost every game at Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they just lost one .
this hat@@ ch will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji began wonderful and allowed the attacks to boun@@ ce GB@@ s out of fun .
it felt for the captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . an , as if one would run into running buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 upwards when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au was in the corner .
with just four minutes of playing , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner he turned around .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a gri@@ pping T@@ ackle from Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain from Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute lete j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua in the right corner went a touch down and it was 0 @-@ 17 for the UK .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the revival and there was still more than a minute of playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u was ra@@ ging through other weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team and stor@@ med to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it is as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 while GB is still taught .
this is the way it is .
GB took basic changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for a whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua tou@@ red Tu@@ i@@ ova after a brilliant intermediate play by Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for the UK , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was long in favor of the South Se@@ ein@@ sul@@ ans , whose fans sang , flags wave and d@@ anced on the grand@@ stand .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ am put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds .
the P@@ fi@@ ff rang , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ g@@ ged and GB crushed crus@@ hing in the grass .
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa in a tight semi @-@ fin@@ alist match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown put the bu@@ ks forward in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kl@@ ing by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the coach &apos;s cancer
there will be no more em@@ och@@ astic gold than with these games and that will mean what .
from the first stro@@ kes up to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve , who enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though there were only the two who were sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams , was omni@@ present when she ru@@ ined the second Olympic @-@ old in a second without a tax @-@ woman in a row , the first women in the history of British sport , who laid on such a standard .
her domin@@ ance was absolute , after all her 3@@ 9.@@ 7 idle time , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant ath@@ let@@ ins that gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the nature of the triumph .
behind every gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make a difference to the incre@@ mental advances that make the difference , and no one was more helpful than the coach who did not know about 30 months ago if he was diagnosed with cancer this day .
as he said he was ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and that they did .
if you do not , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a rather bad situation .
it changes a little bit the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he was able to begin treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , which kept the interruption to a minimum if that under such circumstances is the right concept at all .
I needed money , so I had to get better again soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
this is how it begins .
rowing in itself is already a challenge , but it makes it even bigger .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory , her first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a rainy morning with a little more than usual and tried to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ anning , being a Captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . that &apos;s a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and also Robin have worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin , we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have asked for a better person for exercising or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning did not lose any race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm that their opponents could not keep up with .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started closing , p@@ anning and glob@@ es had too much reserve .
we were very caught at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking to make some rab@@ ies .
we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , what we did .
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV adv@@ entur@@ er Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed out .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exemplary clarity provided for 31 years
the Managing Director of the &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , &quot; Rup@@ pert Gö@@ ller , retired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is considered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bay@@ ern@@ ally exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Frank@@ ish drinking water purpose association serves as a model for the large water producers .
this was the name of the original in an article by the Bavarian Broad@@ casting Corporation a while ago .
little later , the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia government acknowledged the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; applies &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria far as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this , Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller , who was 31 years in the ken@@ nel association , stands for 28 years as managing director .
he was retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brun@@ n , transports approximately 150@@ 000 cubic metres of water annually and supplies 32 places and ham@@ lets with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member communities are the municipalities Kirch@@ wald , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply contracts for other towns and communities .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ n Bürger@@ meister@@ in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller was employed as a water@@ keeper in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organization activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions as well as emer@@ gen@@ cies at weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as an outstanding event she called the inauguration and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the renovation of the elevated tanks ( 1999 ) , the re @-@ purchase of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the replacement of parts of water pipes .
there have been no stand@@ still and I have always added new things because water means life and drinking water is the most important food .

steel - Licht@@ blick for the German Steel Industry
the crisis @-@ packed and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions of dollars .
financial burdens arising from the branch of green electricity production are from the table .
it remains with the release of the renewable energy environment in the existing systems for the so @-@ called self @-@ current production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that after two years we could finally reach negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission initially planned to ask the steel producers to use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel told the WA@@ Z , there is now a statement with the European Commission following talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators are replaced in the steel works an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent is required .
but even these are not le@@ vi@@ ed in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on electricity generation .
as a result , the status quo of the previous regulation is largely as@@ cer@@ tained .
Gabriel &apos;s successful effort for the steel industry is of particular importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steel is future &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others have to follow &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the reform of emissions legislation , climate and employment targets are to be weigh@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained IG Metall head Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe has over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure .
in the past year , the situation continues to ag@@ grav@@ ate when the world &apos;s largest producer of producer China threw steel into the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers acc@@ use Chinese steel groups price dump@@ ing .
in the course of this spring the situation has been somewhat relaxed .
on the one hand , hand @-@ imposed import duties on import ste@@ als have effect , on the other hand the economic outlook in China has risen .
it is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least the prices would have stagn@@ ated .
the industry re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
last but not least Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp wanted to close the closure of individual works .
around 8@@ 6000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July the German steel producers remain cau@@ tious despite increasing prices and increasing orders .
at 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Association announced on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the produced quantity went back to the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production has been two percent lower than the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months , the Association anticip@@ ates an improved order situation thanks to an improved order situation .
community , spirit , health : singing is good for sen@@ iors
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has already accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir , she taught music in the school choir , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Choir .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; singing moves me - emo@@ tionally and physically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she describes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and a total livel@@ ier , she says .
by the way , she does something good for her health and spirit .
because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler says about the German sen@@ iors division .
most senior citizens sing in the chor@@ us and share with like @-@ minded the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular meetings , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
often social and family structures dissolve in age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to rely on others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for doing so , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly request their lungs will not get so quickly out of the d@@ olls in everyday life .
also when it comes to getting the sound of the voice at age , singing is an optimal hobby .
for older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursul@@ a L@@ enz from the Federal Working Group for Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens .
common singing had a much higher priority in the older generations ; it was part of everyday life , both in school and in leisure time , it explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people awak@@ ens many memories , often connected with positive emotions of their youth .
through lyrics and particularly melodies , even dementia suffer@@ ers de@@ vise themselves to long @-@ lying events .
in singing , a special performance is required for the head , explains L@@ enz .
to concentrate on one &apos;s own voice and rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a major cognitive challenge .
just elderly people who live alone practice so not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition you experience through singing in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kler says .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em also grows through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I do something for a long time , I become better and a@@ woke beyond me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start singing is enough .
whoever wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate , even if he thinks he has little talent , says L@@ enz .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who can hear when a sound goes wrong ?
in search of the appropriate offer , senior citizens have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces sings in a senior choir , you can simply join .
many cities also offer views of the choirs in the area .
anyone who wants to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader .
many senior choirs can also be found via the Internet .
those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbours for help with the internet research .
anyone who wants to sing should necessarily join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does good for the soul and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to all ages .
cats react more sensitive than males to cri@@ es of young animals
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover what effect the calling of cat babies on adult animals has .
to their surprise , the mi@@ cks also did not let the males cold - however , they always beha@@ ved equally in difference to the females .
female cats can recognize the degree of reg@@ ression of cat babies at the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
they react by ten percent faster to the sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens who are in great distress , as scientists found out of the Veter@@ inary Academy and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
males also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; obviously the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and heavily stir@@ red young animals are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance for the males , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from MH@@ H .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is the first author of the study published this Friday in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a previous study , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kit@@ ten cri@@ es differ@@ ed with the ur@@ gency of their help .
a total of nine adult males and eight female k@@ itt@@ ens were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
they were played to a herd of small ones , taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more powerful k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition .
the researchers keep their results in spite of the low sample for meaningful ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who had no own offspring , re@@ acted to the scre@@ am , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kon@@ er@@ ding said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned more quickly to the loudspeaker when the sound of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens was playing .
this ability may be con@@ genital or develop sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already investigated the reactions of women and men to baby no@@ ises many times in humans .
some studies also showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to infants , regardless of whether they were mothers or not , the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Po@@ dol@@ ski resorts to Super@@ cup with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
a arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r in Turkey .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match takes place in Turkey .
in front of the du@@ el of the arch@@ rival between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
already in the suspension of the state of emergency after the coup attempt in July , the government , the everyday life of normal citizens , should not be affected .
this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
even before the football it is not stopped .
the prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former celeb@@ r@@ ity of Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r .
according to this , the United States living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ ku@@ r is to be a follow@@ er of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
the state of emergency , which initially lasted for 90 days , is still valid until October , but the fact that most Turks have had no effect on the lives of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the noc@@ tur@@ nal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared that Erdo@@ gan was finished on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - divided into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the Bes@@ ik@@ tas &quot; club do not traditionally belong to the friends of the president .
but what unites the anger of the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict refusal of military put@@ ties .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will arrive particularly once again to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cologne in the past season proved its sporty value : with 17 fo@@ ols and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first playing time as a scor@@ er of his club .
in the final match against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce he scored 1 : 0 @-@ winner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asked him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has completed the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy for his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the pre @-@ round K.@@ O in the Champions League , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leave early in the Europa League . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the South of Li@@ g , it was only sixth .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we did that and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the year was better .
above all thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 season ap@@ points as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ cher King laid the basis for the 14th title .
this is also the reason for the fans to continue to hope for the return of the 31 year old .
in doing so , the Gom@@ ez Treaty , which was contracted by AC Florence , had announced only borrow@@ ed Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt , not to return because of the political situation in the country after his European holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he just needs to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the specialist magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; club director Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , however , the stri@@ ker would have to be willing to for@@ go about a third of the annual sal@@ ami estimated to 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man made clear : &quot; we cannot pay his salary in Florence . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have med@@ als chances at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin has been locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova may not start in Rio .
other out@@ performed athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight for med@@ als in Rio .
the topic dop@@ ing remains the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ owa , who had su@@ ed after a dop@@ ing @-@ lock her starting right shortly before the games , was ki@@ cked out mer@@ cil@@ essly at her start ( 100 meters breast ) .
it offered a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal setting : with a s@@ miles of smiling , she was still in the hall and had provoked her appearance .
when it was said that she was not going to get gold , the audience broke out into a che@@ ering @-@ storm .
but there are still many other sports@@ men who go to the start despite the dop@@ ing past at the Rio Olympics .
here an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 m relay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he has been locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is regarded as the greatest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 m relay / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to take a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after taking the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after surgery , she had had severe tooth@@ ache , she defended the 29 @-@ year @-@ old .
Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( disc@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympic Champion of 2012 , World Champion of 2013 and European Champion from 2010 to 2016 was positively tested on the banned stimul@@ ant drug meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin .
Per@@ ko@@ vic denied the evidence and was closed for six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the big gold fav@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Peking Olympic champion and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , was tested positive for 21 months in 2010 .
a means of penis enlargement was responsible , walked in .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( hammer throw , Belarus ) : hardly an ath@@ lete has been able to recognize so many med@@ als afterwards .
thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title of 2005 nine years later , after he was diagnosed with testosterone dop@@ ing .
in addition , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to release Olympic silver in 2004 due to ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the 2006 European title because of testosterone abuse .
he also recognized the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a verdict of the International Criminal Court of the CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he ranks second in the world ranking .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record chan@@ cell@@ or and Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin was first tested in May , but can still run in Rio .
in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , clu@@ es were found to ing@@ es@@ tion of a forbidden dietary supplement , the ban of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA coinci@@ ded mil@@ dly and ran off already on July 13 .
bomb terror in Thailand - Austri@@ ans hurt - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she suffered wounds and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left it .
she planned her home trip for the beginning of September .
for the time being , whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon , Austrian citizens are still unclear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities , such as Schn@@ ö@@ ll .
at some 200 kilometres south of Bangkok &apos;s capital , Hu@@ a H@@ in explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening in a Night@@ life .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning two explo@@ sives went up again , and according to the authorities another person was killed .
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket a bomb explosion was reported in the morning .
a taxi driver was injured in the det@@ onation in the vicinity of the bathing beach in Pat@@ ong , which was popular with vac@@ ation@@ ers .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country another bomb explo@@ ded which killed a municipal employee .
according to the authorities , the sentence has gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the territorial police prec@@ inct .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ um@@ phon on the south @-@ east coast demanded several injuries .
it was said that there was a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks bear the same hand@@ writing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ om@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express themselves on possible motives - but it is probably a matter of the actions of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern that is typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist uprising movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , one assumes that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military j@@ un@@ ta .
in recent days , the authorities had kept secret references to forthcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed of the exact time and places .
it is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
the police instructed their officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they are mostly not directed against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years by Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
following the long bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is recommen@@ ding to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high safety level ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
after disputes between security forces and Muslim populations , not necessary trips to these provinces will be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
increased safety level ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were held a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the j@@ un@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the coming years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jun@@ ta CEO and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country moves towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody un@@ rest , resist@@ ed itself to have led the kingdom to stability and order again .
however , the military has not managed to get a grip on the revol@@ ting uprising of Muslim rebels who have been fighting for years in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago in Bangkok at a stop at a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack on the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office of Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to several state offices , the constitutional prot@@ ectors in the Con@@ federation have also placed the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see evidence of the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic constitution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Constitutional Court Chief Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ aß of the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , immigrants from Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist ways .
this is why we now observe the movement as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing of French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it turns against &quot; multic@@ ultural del@@ usion , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration , &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s identity by alien@@ ation . &quot;
constitutional Prot@@ ectors in nine Bundes@@ länder - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Wu@@ ert@@ tem@@ berg , NRW , Nieder@@ sachsen , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - already observe the &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ aß said that his authority was closely aligned with the local authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups such as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Court Officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
extre@@ mi@@ sts generally try to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the fac@@ ul@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an advertising slogan for one &apos;s own business .
propaganda is meant to appeal to people emo@@ tionally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , there were reports from several federal states about contacts of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ eating said he did not know how to do that .
for the constitutional protection possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point .
it depends on whether the party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , will change their direction and become so extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor therefore is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
with a view of the significant increase in legal crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ arten said he would not speak of new right @-@ wing terrorism in this context .
but we have seen in recent years that there can be legal structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
it may well be that further right @-@ th@@ ror@@ istic group@@ ings or small groups form , the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
however , a nationwide or pan @-@ European control of legal @-@ terrorism is not recognis@@ able .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
worried about the fact that many tra@@ ps went to the account of people who had not appeared in the right scene before .
this is the wor@@ rying thing .
many of the suspi@@ ci@@ ons in attacks on asylum seek@@ ers had previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated perpet@@ rators or followers of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who were perhaps politically indiffer@@ ent or elected for example CD@@ U , SPD or lef@@ ti@@ sts , who then radic@@ alised themselves through right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist sentim@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
the Olympic Games or the world records do not always determine the head@@ lines of the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ a@@ geous performance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia were so slow that at times he was no longer seen in the TV pictures .
he just disappeared - no matter how wide the cut @-@ out was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ ré was subsequently transformed into a viral drug .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended up with a gap of 48 seconds and finished 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not exactly athle@@ tic figure , which attracted the attention of the international media .
why does the 24 @-@ year @-@ old participate in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian received a special start@@ right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries more well @-@ known .
as most sports@@ men are running in Ethiopia , Hab@@ ré wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media referred to him as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ b of the W@@ hale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; following a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ id &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun of him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 m Fre@@ estyle , played no part .
compar@@ isons with Eric the E@@ el have also been drawn .
in the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete in a race over 100 metres of Fre@@ estyle .
f@@ ren@@ e@@ tically M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old first learned to swim in front of the Olympics for eight months and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

ump sees the im@@ pending electoral defeat not so narrow
the Republi@@ can Pres@@ idential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump is on an election campaign in Florida .
if there is nothing to do with the election of the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already made an alternative video .
he then goes on holiday .
losing Donald Tr@@ ump the US presidential elections in November , it wouldn &apos;t matter to him : &quot; ultimately , it will either work out , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the US television station CN@@ BC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , that &apos;s fine , said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;

GF@@ RP management emerges after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company G@@ f@@ K exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the tail@@ ors came suddenly - but not surprisingly .
the difficult situation of the market research company G@@ f@@ K suggested that the chair by Chief Executive Officer Matthias Hart@@ mann will be all the more un@@ safe the longer the success promised by him .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the G@@ f@@ K Nuremberg Market Research Group : after again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of corporate management , the world &apos;s number five is facing a new beginning .
by the end of the year , the GF@@ RP management boss will leave the company .
the Chairman of the G@@ f@@ K Supervisory Board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert already reti@@ res from the Supervisory Board with effect on 12 September .
as of September 1 , the leadership in the Executive Board will take over the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ bu@@ inger , divided the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is to officially take over the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chief Executive Officer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann was found . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the long @-@ term business alignment as a reason for the tail@@ oring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details didn &apos;t want to name a company spokes@@ man on Friday .
it is still unclear who will be leading the market research company in the future .
on Friday , on Friday , in the case of shareholders , the disappointment of the continuing success of the restructuring measures introduced years ago had been great .
Mr Hart@@ mann has been at the G@@ f@@ K since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the recently bad G@@ f@@ K business figures , every shareholder will be at some point dis@@ quiet at some point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this were the case with BMW , that would make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after set@@ backs in the previous quarters , the company did not have to stop its loss of power in the second quarter of 2016 .
at € 36@@ 1.2 million , sales fell by 6.1 percent below the comparable prior @-@ year quarter .
in the first half of the year , sales of 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million euros were shr@@ inking by 3.4 percent .
the decline in profits in the second quarter was primarily imp@@ acted by the company &apos;s s@@ unken value in the face of its difficult economic situation .
the EUR 139 million depreciation of the company , which became necessary in the Consumer Experience business unit , gave the Group a loss of EUR 14@@ 8.2 million .
in the second quarter of 2015 , the G@@ f@@ K generated net income of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - Bus slides in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n in Gr@@ aben : eight wounded
eight people were injured in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n ( district of Aur@@ ich ) on Thursday during an accident of a touring coach with 43 Sen@@ iors .
two of the in@@ mates suffered serious injuries , the police dealt with .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to her specifications , had to ev@@ ade an opposing truck that partly drove on the reverse road .
the bus came to the right from the street and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch as reported by the police officer Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; due to the situation of the bus the people could not leave the bus on their own , &quot; she said .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liber@@ ated the in@@ mates .
six ambul@@ ances and an emergency ambul@@ ance arrived at the scene of the accident on the provincial road 2 .
the un@@ injured traveler was brought back from a regular bus to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a spare bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators requested the truck driver and possible witnesses to sign up with the police .
the fees per cubic metre of sewage amount from 1 October 2016 for the area of the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ ahl 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ te berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 euros ( until now 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ ore 3.@@ 64 Euro ( up to now 2.@@ 18 Euro ) .
in the case of the plant in Az@@ endorf , the waste water fee will be increased at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a rough calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf is then 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , in the approval of the household by the district office Kul@@ mb@@ ach , established that for these sewage plants under@@ cover runs .
due to legal basis , the market of Kas@@ endorf is obliged to charge the facilities at a cost @-@ covering basis .
as of October 1 , 2016 , the citizens and the commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to go deeper into the pur@@ se .
the fee increases between 48 and 67 percent .
as Administr@@ ative Director Herbert Schmidt showed the body , a new calculation of fees for the wastewater treatment of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over and over @-@ covers from the previous calculation period will also be equ@@ alized .
Schmidt founded the serious fee increases with the fact that all three wastewater facilities were relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack , which was between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
for example , due to the low distribution basis , expendi@@ tures for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a grave effect .
in addition , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly dec@@ lining .
in spite of their age , refur@@ bish@@ ment and repair expenses , in the rec@@ umbent period of the calculation , refur@@ bish@@ ment and repair expenses were to a considerable extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ti@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
Schmidt proved that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the se@@ wer system Az@@ endorf because of damage .
in the pumping station Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , the almost 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led from the ground up and after almost 20 years of operation the first sewage pond had to be dispos@@ ed of , the sewage slu@@ dge dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation option had to be installed in order to meet the water @-@ legal requirements in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the continued maintenance and maintenance costs , which must be taken into account in the new calculation period , came into consideration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were still considerably below the current level during the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made it clear that in the case of low waste water , the expenses for operation and maintenance were &quot; fully pi@@ er@@ ced &quot; in the three plants .
in doing so , Schmidt , the market community of large @-@ scale maintenance costs in the se@@ wer systems , has remained spar@@ ed over the past 20 years .
according to the view of stone houses , the situation for the aforementioned plants will remain prec@@ arious in the long run , especially as one cannot expand the supply area of the Fri@@ esen@@ bach@@ tal sewage association in order to not expand these facilities because they are defici@@ ent facilities .
Bulgaria for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that in July , inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , as positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , a price rise of the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison to the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transport ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
the prices remained as in the pre @-@ month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; and education unchanged .
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as Asian carto@@ on critici@@ zed
Snap@@ chat states that this filter is anim@@ e inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filter tool , Snap@@ chat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders on the absurd .
you can transform yourself into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are bl@@ unt , self @-@ rotating tools that generate more than 30 million sel@@ fies per day .
all mis@@ steps will reach the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have taken criticism in the past in which they were charged that the app would propag@@ ate Black@@ more or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week suggested a filter to some users , who gave them mud @-@ eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist carto@@ on of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot;
they asked whether these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity .
the news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat told that it would have de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as an homage to anim@@ e characters rather than car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who experienced rac@@ ism reminded the filter of inj@@ uri@@ ous c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American student whose twe@@ ets were widely spread over the photos , wrote that the filter was &quot; vulnerable and easy to say . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the ju@@ x@@ tap@@ osition of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ish , but that the yellow face has been pulled into the degra@@ ding extreme .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride party .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and devices that we all hold in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats large audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older counter@@ parts - could be more likely to expect sensitivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates a picture that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed than it was earlier , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete their Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay on medium and in a telephone interview she said that they believe that ra@@ cial controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the settings practices of Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the large part white , only male leadership and ended her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that has largely left the Snap@@ chat un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , Snap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently hired a personnel responsible to concentrate on under@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for their part , Z@@ hu said that she is going to close her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users than us to say that it is not O.@@ K. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military guide fal@@ si@@ fies IS@@ IS intelligence , establishes committee of the Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command have changed intelligence intelligence to sign an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual conditions on the ground have allowed an investigation committee of the Congress to report in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can members of the comb@@ at@@ ant committee , intelligence service committees and military budget committee , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command intelligence agencies who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence intelligence , typically stran@@ gl@@ ed by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders , recorded a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism as the actual conditions on the ground had allowed , and were consistently positive as the analysis of other intelligence agencies , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report .
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; K@@ en Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , noted .
the leadership error in the Cent@@ Com reaches to the top of the organisation .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
although there are no direct indications that government leaders have given instructions under Obama to change reports , it shows how analysts faced the pressure from their superi@@ ors to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , opinions and statements in front of the congress were clearly more positive than the facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report noted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ es could start in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , it is so clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the Central Command heads changed intelligence reports to reduce the risk of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Republi@@ cans called the Task Force into life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed information during the investigations .
in addition , further investigation of the Cent@@ Com reports is ongoing with the Chief In@@ spec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defence .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created an exc@@ essively limited process for the preparation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; announced the highest @-@ ranking Dem@@ ok@@ rat in the Committee , member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the moral under analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave exc@@ essively low space for diver@@ ging opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Shi@@ p and the Democrats stated that there was no indication of a White House intervention in the Cent@@ Com analysts as regards a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the preliminary results of the investigation of the congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s chief inspec@@ tor , who had been in@@ scri@@ bed after complaints by Cent@@ Com analysts .
l@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence does not comment on the reports of the Congress , while the investigation of the In@@ spec@@ tor is still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense have welcomed a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
the alleg@@ ations of last year have raised the question whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessment of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of more than ten years ago when a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a writing about how the then government under George W. Bush approached the recommendations of many analysts but had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker stated that contrary to the government &apos;s statements , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these provisional refin@@ eries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
this recognition , however , was not published , reported the Times in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger Command , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature for its exc@@ essively positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin was retired in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US wins fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Great Britain is before
one day after she shot three goals during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am not one of the people who keep their doors in mind .
however , they know : the American women are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , who remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will take the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first placed will be a little longer on the way to the strong Dutch who lead the other group .
as always the game may go out on Saturday , the American women have triggered a surprising s@@ wir@@ l through their success story four years after they ended up in the last 12 seats at the last London Games .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and for the first time in three years she had a ho@@ ckey stick in her hands ( her two older sisters played sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 , because she couldn &apos;t qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , coach of the national team , began to turn things better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , a mental shift and a physical shift , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we did not have the jobs in London that we now have .
we have completely s@@ nat@@ ched the ru@@ dder .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the door@@ way in the first half of the game with a back@@ lash from the close @-@ up area .
India had gone into play without a victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and drew the ball to the gate to get the American female a 2 @-@ 0 guide .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the go@@ al@@ keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we &apos;re in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
in the middle of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympics .
the Rio de Janeiro events feel consistent and inevitable , a rapid relay race between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning staff , which is handed from the w@@ rist@@ band to a s@@ wimm@@ ers to the gymn@@ ast for tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour &apos;s conversation in the coffee shop , without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the quar@@ rel between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there &apos;s Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time with the Olympic Games and a flock of women with dimples , could well have been among these well @-@ known names sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV advertising , if he were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts or even fen@@ c@@ ers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting gold in the Olympic Stadium .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
further from the centre , partly in the shade are the sports that are not universally recognized : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast swimming and may it rule for a long time .
but if I have modest arguments for my particular favourite , then let me draw attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline jump has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , it was noticed the last 16 years so spar@@ sely that many of those I had questioned did not know that it is a sport of the Olympics .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to compete , it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had an ath@@ lete until 2012 , who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians are inclined to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the trampoline jump has a certain out@@ sider charm , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear for a c@@ lown school that sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a devoted enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ istic potential - the kar@@ to@@ on@@ ish trem@@ bling of its never @-@ ending bo@@ unc@@ ing - but also the gra@@ zie of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two sports that essentially unites it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means much like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
emerging vic@@ tors jumping on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and o@@ int@@ tos ) before they land on their feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the official Olympic program , they are evaluated according to the variant , degree of difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women will compete against each other in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts need to go further , faster , up and down in their quest to gold , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes towards and back , up and down at the playground .
they not only ch@@ ase the finish line or the starting wall , but also a further highlight in the television transmission : the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ords .
the goal @-@ oriented aspir@@ ation is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it &apos;s also what I feel a bit ti@@ ring when watching these games .
of this , the trampoline offers a breathing break .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward motion is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up .
even here there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant repe@@ al of time and gravity .
it is as Zen like the competition can only be at the Olympics .
the qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days starting from 14.@@ 00 .
in the midst of the Olympia Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the ang@@ ling and object ti@@ fication of male athletes - as the male US Tur@@ ner recently proposed to the The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey anticip@@ ates his new fan base according to air .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one generation protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ethiopia , Long is an ally of the USA &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators calling for political changes in Ethiopia met with the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses testified that , during the clas@@ hes with the police , ump@@ teen prot@@ esters were killed during the clas@@ hes with the police .
is Ethiopia just collap@@ sing ?
over the past ten years , it has been one of Africa &apos;s most stable countries , a solid ally of the West , with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months protests erup@@ ted against the government and expanded into more and more areas .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response was rel@@ ent@@ less .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot and killed dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
in circulation , videos about the protests that are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security people strike young people with sticks , while forcing them to make a hand stand against a wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the UN Human Rights Agency now requires a detailed investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project manager of the Horn of Africa , the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous African country in Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West .
U.S. military and secret services work closely with Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorists across the region , especially in Somalia . few countries in Africa , if ever , receive so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
although Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy , human rights organisations have continually led repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , with dissi@@ dents being effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile , or sent to prison , killed or driven into the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and have no other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous gri@@ ev@@ ances that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gl@@ ehold in terms of power of the ruling coalition .
following a widespread election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time , tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ g@@ aden Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which have been forced more or less forced over the past few years , can use tur@@ mo@@ il and arm themselves again .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness are now explo@@ ding after years of getting drunk under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
it was only in recent years that many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media as cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the internet services improved .
even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are .
several young Ethiop@@ ians stated that they were gathered to protest .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia in the predominantly Christian high@@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and economics , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but that too is changing right now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are co @-@ ordin@@ ating under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest protests took place in areas of the Am@@ per@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fair@@ ably dominated by members of the ethnic group of the tig@@ ray , who account for about 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , until his death in a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister .
he was seen as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think around corners .
analysts say that he was particularly interested in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ content and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is lacking in this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen from relatively obsc@@ ure reasons in order to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mel@@ es , who came from the tiger region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of security services controlled by the Tig@@ ers .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 after thousands were prot@@ esting against elections , the government was apparently fed by the government and subsequently stolen .
during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were less than in recent months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , and for their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction .
but apparently this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ art of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous ethnic shape .
last month prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an city , attacked by Tig@@ ray and the hatred for the tig@@ ray is more and more common in social media .
analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ ome flights to neighbouring Somalia , although it recently announced that it closed this base .
while the West wants to support democracy clearly , it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin hike . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim Obama founded IS@@ IS as &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to dissi@@ p@@ ate the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his multiple asser@@ tion that President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious .
this clari@@ fication raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republi@@ cans &apos;s presidential candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and intelli@@ gible with the American public .
it also brings his comrades who endeav@@ our to take refuge in protection during an event@@ ful period , to explain to the peculiar position , statements he did not mean at all .
having made the announcement at a campaign event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump compl@@ ained about the claim on Thursday and insist@@ ed in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the T@@ we@@ et was contrary to the previous day Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation seriously .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tr@@ ump to we@@ aken the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate didn &apos;t want to know about it .
the last storm of criticism colli@@ des with Mr. Tr@@ ump while he has tried to direct the focus of his campaign due to falling survey values on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again .
on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he raised strong criticism when he said that the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but he later said , &quot; Of course , I thought the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back down as needed .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction fails . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates .
but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an even more et@@ ched tone , as his survey values have gone further .
a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist published on Friday showed a leading lead in North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump has generally tried to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics of distor@@ ting his statements or mis@@ understanding his hum@@ our .
but while he increasingly focuses his attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal co @-@ workers into the uncomfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ atively his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s most prominent advoc@@ ates , was trying hard to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani for the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps statement about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had set up the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called her back@@ bit@@ ers , completely wrong and so it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most of the mainstream re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as the foreign minister , allowed IS@@ IS to spread herself by taking control of the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively .
before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of moving around on each of his words and being bi@@ ased against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts trying to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats mo@@ cked Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s ap@@ ologies as a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the Pres@@ idency .
once past the market price , café returns to Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a fo@@ amed café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , in which one could pay only cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi but served for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices came out of his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front .
So@@ ap Cher@@ ie &apos;s business , which reloc@@ ated in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people smo@@ ked it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , except the Chelsea Hotel and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is a change , then it is also new invention .
a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old coffee shop , the owner and managing director of the new cafe .
he started working in Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a customer offered him to provide funds for a new branch office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot of things .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els purchased the same espresso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese on the menu and there are gar@@ nis@@ hes such as cap@@ ers and aci@@ dic onions .
there are natural rice dishes .
the café serves no beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; many old customers have also been squee@@ zed out of Willi@@ am@@ sburg for prizes , &quot; he said .
on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived earlier in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the verb regularly .
even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the road .
after the verb shut down she gave up the coffee drinking for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized that it was the coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
since the beginning of the verb in 2003 , Tom Ros@@ enthal is another long @-@ standing and loyal customer .
he went there before work and inevitably ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came fourth after seven , every day , like a Swiss watch watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal is still getting his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no res@@ ent@@ ment over the fact that the soap business had taken the old business room .
indeed , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap for Ver@@ b with the cold bre@@ w@@ ed coffee of coffee as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we &apos;ll go down to her offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants of Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the bill into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to exhibit her soon so that his new neighbors would feel welcome .
the site also has other advantages .
a local juice local wants to fill and sell the cold bre@@ w@@ ed coffee .
there is a chance that the café is expanding to a neighboring building .
for many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favour@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt told that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee was felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to smell it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a plentiful meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a g@@ our@@ mets President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined delic@@ at@@ essen on Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on that day was a bit more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Bri@@ ck@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ans .
Co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; dealt with Chinese cuisine in the U.S. , while Ziegel@@ man told her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from a food perspective .
her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a repor@@ ter in the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , sle@@ ek@@ ly snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the crash of the stock market in 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key meat with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate .
when the repor@@ ter be@@ headed min@@ ced meat , this found the couple for a discussion about eating in the era of the Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper , which stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating as many pe@@ an@@ uts as serving them as a dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have been in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and freshly baked pa@@ stries were served for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; records the ways with which the country avoided being the land of milk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for the Americans was a central , ten@@ se theme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget diet was just as ten@@ se : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and sau@@ cep@@ ans became stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ole was a &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; says Ziegel@@ man , as coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit .
meat , which has been the center of American cuisine for years , became a rarely served luxury .
strange bl@@ ends have been tried out since a high @-@ calorie and nutri@@ tious satisfaction has priority over taste or even wholes@@ ome cuisine .
while resear@@ ching the book that includes recipes , Bri@@ ck@@ man prepared a dish of this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular additive at noon , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions are not suitable for each other .
it was typical for many of the pet recipes .
as never before , or since then , household econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the country &apos;s eating habits like this .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , she encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ keepers &quot; and to live up to the challenge of changing pamp@@ as such as cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots in delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a feast of historic treats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially tasty are the reports on the response of the government to the hungry citizens , as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ eating attitude .
while he publicly lob@@ bi@@ ed the simple I@@ owa farmer &apos;s kitchen of his kitchen , he fed like the million @-@ million@@ aire man of the world to whom he became .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and bore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was a wonderful reality .
President Roos@@ ev@@ elt might have made the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or called him to make an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the present of a house@@ keeper with no interest in tastes by Ms Roos@@ ev@@ elt added that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most dr@@ astic . &quot;
many of the species from the era of the Great Depression , deal with eating , was rejected as soon as the country came back to the legs .
the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , said Ziegel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food .
the couple had better understood the eating habits of bri@@ ck@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for example how they could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was afraid of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brick rec@@ alls : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she really made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the incident of the wind .
after the plate was cleared at Iron Hill , they and Co@@ e produced a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert , which President Roos@@ ev@@ elt ate at lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une Whi@@ p , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man , adding that it was a usual trick to give a modest name to modest recipes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .

killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he added his own life to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died at a Fass@@ bender @-@ attack by the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of the White Helm@@ ets , a group of civilians who , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 6@@ 0,000 people .
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives on the game to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the area of war .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civil shield showing him during a 11 hour rescue of an inf@@ ant from the rub@@ ble of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians a shining symbol figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he never saw himself as a hero , said al@@ oud : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , this is the real ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die in saving life , I think that God is a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have dropped four drum bombs over the Alz@@ adi@@ a district , one filled with chlorine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now removing the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ n@@ ants of the bomb , so that children don &apos;t play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland &apos;s ha@@ y usually only comes to the surface in winter .
after an investigation , this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea aboard the S@@ anna research ship .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic until today .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ y only get up with 150 years of offspring .
lei@@ surely the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k swi@@ ms along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it is on average just 1.@@ 220 meters far .
only when it arrives , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates to a full 2.@@ 6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a seal .
this lifestyle embos@@ sed by slow@@ ness seems to be a patent recipe for a high age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal &quot; Science &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at any rate from a Greenland hai who could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock , this life @-@ span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the evolutionary bi@@ ologist suspected that Greenland &apos;s hair will become a stone age long ago .
only the evidence was lacking .
Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks are hard to observe , finally they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spitz@@ bergen .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in winter on the surface .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s hair .
their slow motion measured them , when they left six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
nevertheless , in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
maybe they hunt sleep@@ y animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice @-@ sea and look for cad@@ aver that tor@@ tured from higher water @-@ layers down .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues investigated 28 Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie , which caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Spitz@@ bergen as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the biggest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ re measured .
to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the carbon @-@ 14 method the l@@ enti@@ cular of the sh@@ arks .
this centre of the eye lens is formed already before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins in it are not renewed later .
the two smallest sh@@ arks were remark@@ ably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
therefore , their birth was supposed to lie in the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons trials drag@@ ged large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
on the other hand , with 220 centimet@@ res in length , the l@@ enti@@ st , on the other hand , contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons tests , which is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday during its investigation in 2012 .
on the other hand , all larger Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in their lin@@ sen@@ ic nucle@@ us , which results from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 @-@ cen@@ timeter @-@ long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k showed an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers might even be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai @-@ females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was well @-@ known .
now the researchers of the length could assign an age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res was probably at the threshold of the sexually mature stage and its age was determined at 156 years , Greenland &apos;s ha@@ y with the increase obviously become at least one and a half centuries time .
this is also likely to be the world record for verteb@@ rates .
it is not by chance that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live mainly in icy waters .
the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year @-@ old Greenland wh@@ ale , in whose bac@@ on at the neck was a 120 year old har@@ poon pointed , was caught off Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on as@@ par@@ agus flame .
so they mature later - and grow slower .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often very big .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat .
the loss of heat from one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than that of a gram of elephant .
another advantage : they have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as early as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the evolution@@ bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very large animal should , on the other hand , invest its resources in a long life .
building plot in double pack
in the recent session , the municipal council has focused on issues relating to building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the Board accepted the communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the plot , parcel and access questions were clari@@ fied and the applications could be made for survey , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; Road road &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( Area of Bin@@ der@@ straße - Construction section 1 ) is nothing more accessible to interested parties .
the municipal council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community will appeal to young families and elderly sen@@ iors in equal measure .
as it was said , members of the building can immediately register in the town hall , and the municipal council is expected to discuss the allocation of the par@@ c@@ els in its September meeting .
in order to be able to accommodate requests for the establishment of further businesses associated with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the newly created land use plan in sub @-@ areas only in the spring of this year .
in the area of Unter@@ st@@ lar@@ n , the industrial area , which has already been proven there , is extended by two plots to the state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
the city on the Main has the best chances to attract new jobs and companies from London in competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence field financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether financial institutions should be allowed to run further from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport to date , it is sufficient for them to be admitted in the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s why big US banks use this .
several banks have already announced to reloc@@ ate jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lob@@ b@@ ying association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reck@@ ons with 10@@ 000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , thus the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the Risk Council ES@@ R@@ B .
while in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while Luxembourg conce@@ des a large fund industry , it also cuts down the infrastructure as well as Dublin .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the big airport .
the city is also home to easily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial properties were 50 percent higher than in the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the company consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city stands on seventh place , Luxembourg on No@@ .@@ 19 , Dublin in No@@ .@@ 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concluded the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe , despite the Bre@@ x@@ it vote .
for this purpose , the correlation of forces : in London , according to the figures of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba in the end of 2015 , some 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead gets legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
an American judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to reimbur@@ sement of the legal costs arising from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ te C law@@ suit with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was exemp@@ ted from compensation payment amounting to $ 200 million for the infrin@@ gement of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which were linked to the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs called S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after an American judge revealed a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including Mein@@ icy and other in@@ ethical action .
when the complaint was filed on Thursday , US counter@@ judge Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to the expense incurred during the defense of the case .
Mer@@ ck is trying to reconci@@ le Gilead to the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case dates back to the year 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck compl@@ ained of each other and claimed possession of laboratory work that led to the use of Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vi@@ r , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .
troops supported by the US say that they have reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
supported by the U.S. , the full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters in the city left them , said a group spokes@@ man on Friday .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) , following the exo@@ dus of the remaining group of fighters who have buried itself within the city , are currently comb@@ ing the city .
they released more than 2,000 civilians , who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , Shar@@ eholders approved the wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j military council Reu@@ ters , which was alli@@ ed with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we just carry out clearing operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s worth 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton released her tax return for 2015 on Friday , which resulted in the US presidential candidate and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former Secretary of State Bill Clinton managed almost USD 5,@@ 3 million in Rede@@ ye@@ es ; the former Foreign Minister issued an income of USD 3 million by the Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster publishing house for her book on her term in the State Department .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for vice @-@ pres@@ idency , Sen@@ ator Tim neu@@ ine from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton published his tax statements of the last ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim neu@@ ters continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ eri announced in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hides behind false statements and re@@ trac@@ ers with regard to his previous promises to publish his tax statements .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax statements although they are not obliged by law because of it .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated a tax check by tax authorities as a reason for his refusal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign hel@@ per Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , referring to the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special Ad@@ visor , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to release anything before tax inspections are not completed .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Cri@@ tics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business units and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already fallen on the subject and released a video on the Internet on Friday in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump asked to publish his tax return .
on Thursday she spoke on the subject during a speech on the economy of Mich@@ igan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done over the past few decades and to publish his tax statements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ tico has reported that Tr@@ ump has paid no or only very little taxes during the 1990s , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a series of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ers on Friday , stating that this could still be the case .
federal taxes have become a subject in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett that would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 Million deserve a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial glomer@@ ate has its seat here , Tr@@ ump to exchange their tax declar@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a tax check of the I@@ RS and Tr@@ ump has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has returned tax return until 2007 .
the Clinton &apos;s , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , aver@@ aged an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % .
the 2015 Clin@@ tons tax declaration showed that these only accept USD 100 of their income as a salary , unlike most Americans .
its major investment was a low @-@ cost index fund from which the Clinton divi@@ den@@ ds and income of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed .

con@@ doms with ci@@ li@@ pow@@ ders , fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going to inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with chil@@ i powder .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which had the idea for years ago , has intensified its promotion along with the U.S. natural protection by train volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crops without viol@@ ating animals .
previously , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves .
Friday is the world &apos;s day &apos;s day , dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in attitudes within these communities , although they are much more confident that they can stop the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant in doing so , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if he is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the spark plug .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust of chil@@ i powder into the air .
a touch right usually starts to ch@@ ase the elephant .
one last possibility is a th@@ row@@ er who shoots a golden fire@@ works into the air while causing a loud , bright explosion .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we generally welcome new business@@ men , but at this location in an exposed location on the banks of the Rhine this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director breaks Berlin hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; appeal - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media watch after betra@@ ying that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list any Israeli pre @-@ election as there were Arab guests &quot; requested &quot; according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentation &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel in the country &apos;s selection list .
however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel through its own call center .
after an explanation , the director addressed the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shot him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel employee said the measure was a deliber@@ ate decision of the management of Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
the reason behind it spark@@ ed even more anger in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great dis@@ grace &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung reports . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were app@@ alled and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in this hotel chain is even greater shame .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a pretty big resonance on the internet where people called the whole thing a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of them signed the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recre@@ ated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alleged demands of Arab guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in another article , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , stands near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly pointed out all alleg@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct instruction , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take Israel into the fast selection list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code is now added .
police places tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ let against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met with the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students what led to the police put on rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about their plans .
according to the Gover@@ nor of the State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed while 300@@ ,000 students are implemented to save money .
some of the prot@@ esters were seen gra@@ ff@@ iti on the provisional President Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
the latest protests took place several days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff who had been dismissed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rose to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and T@@ eher@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , interest on parties of Russian firms in the country grew strongly , the ambassador said .
Russian companies take up existing links with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that in the first five months of 2016 , the trade turnover between Russia and Iran grew by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade break was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year , D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan is talking about a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , Russia &apos;s foreign representation amounted to around 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , first of all , travel visa , to Iranian citizens .
Iran also reached the top 20 countries regarding the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia were broken last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have preserved the monuments of the old Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witnesses wanted : beverage market in Wald@@ br@@ öl over@@ comes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a rob@@ ber@@ y attack on Thursday evening had been practi@@ sed on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the support of a fire@@ arm , three dark dressed people , who had trimm@@ ed their faces , demanded the return of cash by the employee of the beverage market and then fled at first on foot and then probably with a silver VW Golf .
how much money has been exploited , the police do not share .
the perpet@@ rators should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters tall , thus relatively small .
the beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the ra@@ ve market and can be viewed poorly .
the perpet@@ rators must be banned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and from the gravel parking space located opposite the park entrance with the silver @-@ colored car , possibly towards B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
who made observations ( at 19.@@ 45 o &apos;clock ) observations , which are related to the rob@@ ber@@ y attack , should urgently notify the police .
Nag@@ old : fun and fun during summer holidays
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and youth of the social educational day group / social group work of the Children &apos;s Protection Federation Nag@@ old with their supervis@@ ors during their summer vac@@ ations in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
in the quiet Lei@@ tw@@ äl@@ len leisure estate , the life @-@ joy@@ ous group was quartered during the first week of school holidays .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand it went to b@@ ail with the visit of the pet@@ ting zoo .
to the other , to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world famous monastery .
the third excursion led to P@@ for@@ z@@ heim .
in the Cel@@ tic Museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days , the group met at the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited for jumping , swimming and sp@@ lashing .
children and car@@ ers with their self @-@ prepared body@@ guards , such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese , were treated with culinary delicacies .
in workshops , beautiful pieces of jewelry made of beads and stones were created or made of wood a Roman mill game .
further highlights of leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Color@@ ful E@@ ven@@ ing . &quot;
on the day of the voyage home the sun laugh@@ ed and the children and young people returned home satisfied .
ha@@ y@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the Gate of Mer@@ cy
the altar boys from the sea @-@ care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
four stages were dealt with together .
in order to bridge the time until the next Romanesque pilgrimage of all the mini@@ ons in the course of two years , the Federal Council of Ministers of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a several @-@ day pilgrimage .
various pilgrimage destinations have been examined and finally decided for the Epis@@ cop@@ al City of Freiburg , where , this year , during the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy with the opened portal of mercy at the Freiburg cathedral , a special pilgrimage destination was offered .
16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and the holy rooms , went their way .
in the evening before , Father Stor@@ ost sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrimage crosses and distributed pilgri@@ ma@@ ges .
from Hor@@ b it was driven by train to the starting point of Vil@@ lingen , where also a Mu@@ enster University of Our Lady stands and thus the Pil@@ gri@@ mage was started by the Min@@ ster .
the single day tours were framed in the morning and evening , depending on a brief impulse with different prayers , songs and texts .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is made a rest at field cross@@ ings , chap@@ els or churches to sing together a song from a specially assembled pilgri@@ m song booklet .
for the nights the parish halls of the local par@@ ishes were at their disposal .
Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller cared for a tasty and star@@ chy dinner and breakfast .
we continued on the second day via Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
on top of that , one stepped up the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , but at first some 500 meters of altitude had to be desc@@ ended from high heat and then climbed again .
the earned reward was a common barbecue at the Bad@@ wei@@ her in the evening .
after the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter we went to the final stage to Freiburg .
visi@@ bly facilit@@ ated and happy the Min@@ is arrived at the Freiburg Min@@ ster in the later afternoon and walked through the portal of mercy .
with a small impulse God was thank@@ ed .
the Min@@ is by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t arrived at the evening mass in Münster .
after the divine service the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day there was still time for the Brei@@ s@@ dal metropolis .
in the afternoon we went by train back to Hor@@ b .
at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked .
Scot@@ s@@ man Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Br@@ ite wins gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last night in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor roll , who had made his fellow coun@@ try@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y to E@@ igen . the j@@ ig@@ saw made the legend proud when he stor@@ med home to win a victory from the favour@@ ites of New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after taking a modest sixth place during the World Championships in London in March , despite the appearance of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did so in time as a hin@@ dran@@ ce .
Ho@@ ys retired created a gap that ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots un@@ folding now .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y - and Sk@@ inner set up an Olympic board in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his lap , behind him , Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a big part of the transformation in which Hin@@ des drove in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y saw from his position as BBC expert and dropped Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they climbed to the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for myself .
we set up an Olympic board in the final round and defeated the world champi@@ ons .
it was just incredible .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph of 2012 alongside Kenn@@ y &apos;s and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ der admitted that after a weak start he dropped off on the rail@@ road .
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no opposition from England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
this time there was no such problem with such an outstanding victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ di said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like London with all the UK flags like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of possibility that he repe@@ ats Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a contest .
this would be for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for British sport ; on that day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be the same as Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go for more than three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two other gold med@@ als , he should be struck to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilomet@@ re race .
they arrived at the finish in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held on the second day of the competition , with which W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
yesterday he was argu@@ ing with representatives before the qualification when officials called him to measure his height .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued and ended tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the UK team relies on his strong train wheel team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a crowd of med@@ als .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
in the background , drama turned out to be the res@@ ignation of Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April , in the midst of sex and bul@@ b@@ bing alleg@@ ations , as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if one sees the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite like that the legendary reputation GB@@ s , who reached its peak at the perfect moment , could be repeated again .
future of the melting of Port@@ land due to the aboli@@ tion of the energy contract
the future of the aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places by workers - are at stake , as the plant operator announces the energy supply contract and thereby elev@@ ates all supply contracts , as the supplying energy company announced .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies for the operation of the plant .
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years runs in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the Al@@ coa facility in Port@@ land are at stake .
no less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk when closing .
in addition , it could lead to dom@@ ino effects as the melt @-@ melting consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Victoria .
in 2014 Al@@ coa fired the Point Henry melt , which last year led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant .
the melting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks closure .
this step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melting company with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p are holding smaller shares .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity by melting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts are so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that should have come into force from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month notice period so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that contracts will contribute to revenues in the financial year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential implications for AG@@ L revenues from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L announced that it has already tran@@ scri@@ bed the value of the contracts in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expecting a termination &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ coa said that the decision to contract the contracts , the &quot; Al@@ co@@ as ability ... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; does not interfere .
the U.S. company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang who would have come into force from November this year even if it is still deb@@ ated why it has res@@ ig@@ ned from the contract .
due to the poor economic conditions of the industry , analysts warn against the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
in reference to the analysts &quot; statements at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations said Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen that Port@@ land uses around 600 MW and Tom@@ ago to consume about 900 MW of electricity every year .
should both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generating set this wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of the Vog@@ ue
San Antonio J@@ en@@ ner , 20 , Model and the fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ erin and mother of the Car@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ en@@ ner clan , Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September edition of the US Vog@@ ue .
Antonio , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran at Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , on Thursday announced the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kendall wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover of Cover@@ s was followed by a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans &apos; similar ? ) , seen reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ en@@ ner family ( except for the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the most popular show bi@@ z unc@@ le and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ry@@ an Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as they finish the cover of their sister and that ended with a classical twist : they all have a surprise party planned .
this represents the c@@ lich@@ é@@ d action of almost every birthday party of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a carto@@ on on a slot at 8@@ am ) , but Kris did not have to let her other girls take part in this publicity .
with regard to the September issue of the Vog@@ ue , surely a new era of car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has begun .
Kend@@ a &apos;s big sister Kim may have beaten her , concerning the Vog@@ ue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to see it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September edition is the most sold issue of the year for Vog@@ ue .
with a circum@@ ference that rather resembles a photographic book than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of adverti@@ sers ( Accor@@ ding to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the walt@@ z 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the revelation of his cover stars is so eag@@ erly awa@@ ited that in the last two years pictures of the journal were still se@@ eping before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there have been more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Models that celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar prize winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
but even with the small chance that Mrs. J@@ en@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the former category , it is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to celeb@@ ri@@ ties or reality stars or te@@ ens of today who know how to turn a good snapshot video ( even if it &apos;s all true to J@@ en@@ ner ) .
they are truly talented women who sign up in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course , J@@ enny &apos;s success doesn &apos;t like everyone .
with its reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world was always something ten@@ se .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ en@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed her and called her &quot; the mist@@ let@@ oe of the moment . &quot;
these feelings cooked up again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vog@@ ue cover .
but there seems to be a point where it seems to pass .
Kendall J@@ en@@ ner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vog@@ ue .
it is super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
she makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all your sisters will sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Pay@@ wall Apps .
she sells pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is seen in reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
community Centr@@ es yearly assign 16@@ 0,000 people yearly
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s auxiliary facilities are reported annually by the municipal law centres , while the industry is preparing for the effects of other short@@ cuts on already over@@ bur@@ dened transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly elderly people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ ations and similar - are rejected in their search for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already at full capacity , are prepared for further cuts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from June next year it is planned that these legal centers will lose 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of the community centre of Que@@ bec James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Cultural Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people have already been rejected each year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only be worse without repe@@ aling the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ funded , which means that thousands of people are rejected by important services you need , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relationships , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and oppres@@ sive debts , families that have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been dismissed un@@ just - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need .
as of June 2017 , the federal government will cut its resources by 30 percent , which means that thousands of Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s hel@@ pless people will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any assistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we urge the General Prosecutor and Federal Minister of Justice and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately susp@@ end these short@@ cuts , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the community centres and their clients , and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k has invested in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump Freedom campaign accused after employee re@@ port@@ edly pulled weapons
new York : Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps Camp@@ aig@@ n has been charged with alleged in@@ action after she was told that her campaign manager for North Carolina had directed a gun at a staff while she was on the way in February in a je@@ ep .
the incident is described in an indictment filed in Charlotte B@@ ord@@ i on Wednesday , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ord@@ i gave up for months waiting for the matter to be settled internally before he realized that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulled a gun , put his right index finger on the trigger , and grab@@ bed the course at Vinc@@ ente &apos;s knee , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ord@@ i in his accus@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after compl@@ aining to the local and regional campaign leadership , B@@ ordin@@ i found that at least four more people had already had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he stated in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to do harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ord@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accus@@ ation came only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate triggered a rebellion when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - gun owners and arms bud@@ dies - should take action if his rival was elected H@@ illary Clinton and appoint judges .
Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign made it clear that the media had torn his words out of context and that he would not inc@@ ur violence .
B@@ ordin@@ is &apos;s complaint requests compensation from the campaign for breach of duty of care and Philip for bodily injury and lasting mental harm .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Press spokesperson for Hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached for a comment .
attempts to contact Philip failed as well .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer a member of the campaign .
on calls from his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted .
Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has so far led a controversial campaign .
the procedure is B@@ ordin@@ i v. Donald J. Tr@@ ump For President , Inc . , 16 @-@ CS @-@ 14@@ 300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) .
Berlin / Schwer@@ in : pol@@ l before country elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
during the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , there are considerable losses for the governing party SPD and CD@@ U .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this revealed representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to go@@ vern in the north , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin .
in both federal states , however , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to pose the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD dropped from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party was only margin@@ ally ahead of the CD@@ U , which could return to 23 per cent again .
the third place is controversial between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the country &apos;s parliament .
despite slight losses of 6 per cent ( previously 8.@@ 7 per cent ) , the Green Party returned to Schwer@@ in &apos;s Land@@ tag .
with 3 per cent , N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented on the Land@@ tag .
according to the German Social Democrats ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 per cent ) , the German Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) of the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
the CD@@ U only achieved 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
it therefore still lag@@ ged behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but in front of the left with 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented at the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives for the first time at 14 percent .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , while the pir@@ ates would be missing in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market .
the followers today dominate the world - his manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed nearly half a kilogram and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5 .
it was thicker and bigger , therefore it was not good at hand .
on the contrary , it was rather pal@@ pit@@ eous .
the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would be enough for about two sel@@ fies of high resolution today .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigab@@ ytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arrived exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros , fans can buy the equipment on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age .
20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it computer fair in Hanover as an &quot; office in the west pocket format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could send a lot for that standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax the communic@@ ator was to be reached .
even access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , al@@ beit tor@@ tu@@ ously slow .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
the price was quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could suspect in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
everything has changed since then .
smart phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s &apos; mobile phone line experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold and handled by Microsoft .
today vendors , who came all a lot later than Nokia , are domin@@ ating the market .
being online all over the world today is everyday life for a lot of people .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users around the world .
about 1.4 billion devices were sold , Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units .
worldwide sales of the equipment will be around € 400 billion .
in addition , the well @-@ running businesses of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies are coming .
in the meantime , a whole industry has emerged around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced on the Mac @-@ World the introduction of the iPhone .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet communic@@ ator , easy to use by touch screen .
Apple &apos;s trium@@ phant success , the iPhone is still the company &apos;s most important product .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ Berry , who dominated the market , had the view .
she finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the legends now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
on average every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all need to learn to put the Smartphone away again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of staff at the Siemens board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just as in 2012 in London , when we used a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities , we will have 10,000 new apprenti@@ ces alone , who create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport surroundings .
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ amed on the world stage .
the two @-@ fl@@ yers had wron@@ ged in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers any question asked .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project .
expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in economic growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and to the whole of the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has converted a £ 11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 which was built in the middle of the two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the London matches of 2012 were a great success for the UK and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time for us to ste@@ er this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trading and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and Maus@@ play &quot; regarding ad blocking
for companies who earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers , attempts to circum@@ vent ad blocking are equal to a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertisements on its desktop site , Ad@@ block Plus released a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to block again advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday Facebook shared with that his desktop site would change the coding regarding his advertisements to make it difficult to recognize the recognition of which part of the site advertising is .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blog post , Ad@@ block &apos;s spokes@@ man , Ad@@ block Ben Williams , wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her struggle has been underway between the do@@ cking open source community and the b@@ yp@@ assing since the invention of display lock@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicators for the industry have become .
according to a study conducted by Pa@@ ge@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people worldwide use display lock@@ ers worldwide , almost four times as much 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users who access their mobile devices on Facebook , cell advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertising revenue .
apart from the fact that mobile ad blocking has no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , a spokes@@ man announced it .
advertising on desktop PCs makes a large proportion of revenues so that Facebook appears to be worth the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ad Pre@@ ference Tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to have more control over the adverti@@ sed advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ blocks would be wor@@ rying about new filters because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users , this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook spokes@@ man in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad blocking is a bl@@ unt tool , which is why we have focused instead on developer tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control over people &apos;s hands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; woman at presum@@ ed suicide transfer to Swiss highway &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was lying in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call for witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday passed by a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles on a motorway .
the incident took place on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman lay in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police in Vau@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 wanted to kill himself , including a truck , including a truck .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police told them , as well as every witness of the incident to report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter told Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be held accoun@@ table .
in each of the two cases - in which a person ran on the highway in the dark - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian walks in the middle of the night on the highway as it was in the newspaper .
last year , a police officer was acqu@@ itted of the negli@@ gent killing after passing a man and killed him who was on the A1 in August 2014 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and became unconscious in the street , took the court .
the court noted that the police - who had answered an emergency call -- drove to a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges , should report to the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
according to projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was likely to be hab@@ itable once .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies NASA developed a model to discover the past of the Venus based on tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate researchers .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have been re@@ trac@@ ted with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once ground @-@ like conditions .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ like atmosphere and slowly turned on .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably showed more dry areas than earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to house life and protected from fast evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matt .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of the Venus increases its day @-@ side of the sun almost two months long , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the sun &apos;s heat .
the result is average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than that of the earth today .
the model brought forth a history of the Venus that resembles the evolution that previously was suspected of planet researchers .
although it was probably hab@@ itable , Venus -- during the course of several billion years --@@ was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
her oceans di@@ gest@@ ed and her water vap@@ or was burned away by the ultra@@ violet light .
as their Hydro@@ gen escaped , only a thick atmosphere remained at carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect - Venus , as we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy coming back as a trainer of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as Trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to low co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new coach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past three years , I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the summer , I have been thinking a lot about how I could improve this team to give it more depth that it needs and bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the Vision of Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to those of the organization .
it must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions affecting the performance of the team .
these conditions are not met at the moment .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today Patrick informed me about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
during his debut season in 2013 @-@ 14 Roy was honored as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the best coach in the league .
he led the club to 112 points and in the first place in the central vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the low season in each of the last two years .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the wild for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy has won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ th@@ ee@@ pers resume talks , put on strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour disputes relating to the remuneration for North sea workers are suspended , while all conten@@ ders for a new round of talks set themselves at the table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were conducted spor@@ adic@@ ally on platforms in the North Sea , which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ites and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the development process of the current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold several full day sessions over the next few weeks , starting next year to restart the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s credit rating is followed by a 10 % drop for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts will give the company the required space to come through the market down@@ turn .
shell has released thousands of people for its part and plans to give up its oil and gas transactions in up to 10 countries as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; energy companies are under pressure on the basis of lower crude oil prices , an economic situation which was reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish Parliament committee , Dave Anderson , met with workers &apos; leaders at the beginning of this week in order to discuss one of the biggest work disputes that took place in the North Sea for one generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea are expected to be at an average of around $ 7 billion over the past five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers collect the most complete catalog of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the zo@@ di@@ ac cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help the astronom@@ ers understand why stars rotate in the cluster of stars to different rates , as well as in what context the rotation @-@ periods with the planet formation are .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other con@@ stell@@ ations , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the Stern@@ enh@@ aufen of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light @-@ years from the earth .
many stars in this cluster of stars , which originated some 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ thood .
they are now the fastest .
at peak rot@@ ational rates these mature stars exp@@ el large amounts of star winds .
as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
if a star age , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a visible star spot -- like sun@@ spots .
the latest catalog of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars turn slower than the massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es stars with dancers , with larger stars moving slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; in the Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
as the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the P@@ lei@@ ades star cluster offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is still a lot to learn about how , how , When and why stars can slow down their rot@@ ational rates and hang their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dance shoes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so to speak . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in three newspaper reports detail@@ ing their latest analysis of the P@@ lei@@ ades &quot; rotation rates , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial Bas@@ eball star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball @-@ star in the best days from Base to Base .
following his emotional release , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will be wearing the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys on August 12th .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying good@@ bye &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participant of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three times , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was voted the most valuable player in the League , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
he signed a ten @-@ year contract for 27 million US dollars a year since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will act as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary .
as a player , it paid Rodri@@ gu@@ ez back for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Nav@@ al ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he made some mil@@ estones .
with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two more bas@@ eball players play similar levels in the most important statistics .
however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should nevertheless not be included in the resting @-@ hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was so successful - in the field , his appearance outside the place is cont@@ ested . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave birth to the banned ster@@ oids between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , due to an involvement in the so @-@ called bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal , he was blocked for 211 games by the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the main suspect to have received an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida for years .
after a law@@ suit , the lock was reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done a favour for 2014 , because I played through 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , at that time sweet@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even his f@@ arewell days did not run sil@@ ently .
while many bas@@ eball legends have once again received the big stage in their final games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was often forced to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job ent@@ ails trying to win any game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az , was given the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , sympathy of the fans of Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Erz@@ riv@@ ale Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the fans sang at 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez @-@ Team .
Olympic 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland must not start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing events .
a wi@@ ped ath@@ lete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing events became known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese float in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre obstacle @-@ runner Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded in Brazil - just before the start of the already critical athle@@ tics competitions these messages come to an end .
in Ch@@ en last Sunday the di@@ ure@@ tic Hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de was detected , which is used as a massive drug for dop@@ ing substances .
on Friday afternoon , the CA@@ S International Sports Court confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took fourth place in the final over 100 m of butterfly , only 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en should have participated in the courses over 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and requires full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will work with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history , the IO@@ C is no longer responsible for sanc@@ tioning athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio the news came about the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she was innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be nutritional supplements &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the ath@@ lete announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , the banned substance should be the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova was pro@@ vision@@ ally suspended , according to the B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should also be positive .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v promptly communicated with criticism of the ath@@ lete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we are Bulg@@ arians under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
for example , all wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from the chronic dop@@ ing @-@ poll@@ uted nation are not allowed to take part in Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , the case &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , was tested positive for the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days earlier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both of them deny the intake , but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the athletes start , the Dan@@ ap@@ owa case is a further heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport .
the IA@@ AF World Union had prohibited the entire Russian team up to an exception due to systematic dop@@ ing , but also the Kenya nation produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in addition , in the swimming sport , the previous off@@ ences in China also caused violent clas@@ hes between the athletes .
so the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t on the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Sun was at the heart of a confrontation with Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing fraud , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was positively tested in the Chinese champi@@ onships for the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but only had to sit down a three @-@ month lock .
data theft : so per@@ fi@@ de black@@ mail h@@ ack@@ ers their ran@@ som
programmers of express malware are currently target@@ ing companies - and are successful .
according to a recent survey of the malware defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes of 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surv@@ eyed companies in the last twelve months were at least once , in part multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som required by the perpet@@ rators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , the perpet@@ rators special@@ ise in attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially black@@ out ran@@ som will be significantly higher than for private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a start@@ ling spe@@ edy evolution of the malware , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes leader Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 , most Mal@@ war@@ e@@ Program@@ mes were still designed to send advertising .
then the offen@@ ders discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
only private users were the target , but the change to company att@@ aches occurred rapidly in the past months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once active on a victim &apos;s computer , it searches for recently changed files such as Word , Excel or database files as well as to archive images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and er@@ ase the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the recei@@ v@@ ables of the black@@ mail .
in order to get the end turn code to the files , the victims have to transfer money - usually in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin .
but where private users find the personal photo database at stake , companies deal with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production stops .
accordingly , the damage comes off when a ran@@ som@@ ware hits .
22 percent of the German companies affected reported loss of turnover by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to completely inter@@ rupt business operations , in one case people were in danger of living .
in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks , whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : don &apos;t pay , you only support the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data .
for managers , it is difficult to reject the perpet@@ r@@ ator &apos;s demand in view of a down@@ time in operation .
the h@@ ack@@ ers , in turn , know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the safety researchers from F @-@ Secure have investigated the user interfaces and contact with black@@ mail users and come to the conclusion : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain their victims via chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set free accessible support websites or dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t sample files for free .
and if private people are redeemed for payments of just a few hundred euros , companies have to negotiate tough and pay five @-@ digit amounts in order to get their data back un@@ encrypted .
given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ack@@ ers become more and more professional and share the work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski of the anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware roughly within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that it is about three or four persons .
the programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software building block to the actual black@@ mail .
the existing malware kit came into being by purchasing the malware itself , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and $ 10,000 .
&quot; included is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski says .
the black@@ mail@@ ers then seek out more h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service industry .
so one logs in one of the forums on the ground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and asks another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is per certified computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the criminals then use sp@@ amm@@ ers with dis@@ semination , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now well @-@ known for many companies that better secure their data .
more than 50 percent of the companies IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust that Ran@@ som@@ ware can rep@@ el Ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful measurement , the perpet@@ rators are threatening to release sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes boss Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the potential damage potential is much higher , depending on the type of data .
in the future , the perpet@@ rators may have completely new targets on the Internet of things on the grain .
at the Def@@ con h@@ acker conference , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpet@@ rators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of the heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .

sounds fairly over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V seems rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear , it does not work closely at any place .
the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit @-@ top falls down there .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only a luggage compartment of 4@@ 53 l for raised and 10@@ 26 l with inver@@ ted back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds like : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a chin @-@ up and thus offer storage space , which is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling .
the luggage compartment can be loaded well , but the charging height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
however , he should do his job a bit more quietly .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another engine : a 1.5 liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a four @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the steering is likely to be somewhat more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the top version tested &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the safety systems include the City emergency brake assist ( works at speeds 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because he ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when manoeu@@ v@@ ring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the remote light assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent drive controller respon@@ ds to the traffic sign recognition and throt@@ tles the speed if necessary .
but the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , App integration and more .
two US@@ B@@ - and one HDMI socket are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to achieve .
the roughly 29@@ ,000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top diesel is fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standards .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda provides a versatile and everyday car .
airline is not liable : fall on passenger jet@@ ty
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Higher Regional Court of Dus@@ sel@@ dorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is conceivable only in the case of haz@@ ards typical of air traffic .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee cap in the fall .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline had to pay no damages to the man .
illness : when pays the organizer
after their trip , ill holi@@ day@@ makers get money back when the cause of the illness can be found without doubt in the hotel .
but this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests have proven to show the same symptoms .
in the case of a negotiated down@@ fall , a family had suffered severe diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their door@@ man &apos;s holiday .
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
their illness brought the holi@@ day@@ makers back to a defective treatment plant , which supposedly had poll@@ uted sea@@ water .
the family believed that the trip had been poor with it - and compl@@ ained against the organizer .
the plain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success before the court .
indeed , the sewage treatment plant was in fact defective .
but the organis@@ er only learned about it shortly before he left the plain@@ ti@@ ff .
he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information so judgment .
especially since no im@@ puri@@ ties were found in the samples of the water .
the illness of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said that after the violent acts committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks .
the state must be so@@ ber@@ ed and resol@@ utely at the same time responding to terrorist attacks .
sure : our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hatred and division .
we will not treat this triumph to the terrorists .
if criminals should leave the country faster , the security and strength also increase the approval of the population for the refugee policy .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve a tran@@ sposition of the proposals to the Bundestag election 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle four @-@ digit order over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
raising sympathy for terrorism needs to be punished again .
CC@@ TV surveillance aims to improve weapons law in such a way that it is more difficult to buy weapons on the internet .
the last much discussed sec@@ rec@@ y for physicians should be maintained according to de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , in dialogue with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; medical profession &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he wants to look for solutions to reduce the threat of citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said with regard to mental ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act a radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister considers a better social support necessary .
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ sed people .
to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the deployment of hidden investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD boss Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Interior Minister clearly expressed himself against activ@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a sla@@ p for the sni@@ per in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had previously rejected calls from the Union following a Bur@@ ka ban and the aboli@@ tion of double nationality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it considers a general prohibition of full @-@ wear to be constitu@@ tionally problematic .
you can &apos;t forbi@@ d anything you refuse , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
it is possible to talk about rules such as road traffic or for witnesses to court .
green @-@ chief Sim@@ one Peter accused the minister that he wanted to simulate the action and capacity of action with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terror p@@ act .
left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; fleet pro@@ verb@@ s and a tigh@@ tening of the right to stay bring people in this country no longer security . &quot;
better flow of traffic on the motorway feeder
it st@@ alls regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here is a picture of November .
but this shall change : the law of law shall be prolonged .
this is good news for all car drivers who are in traffic on the surrounding road every night in traffic , when driving over the free@@ way to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16th / 17th August ) , road construction will be extended by 700 metres in the area between the Hammer Street and the Wes@@ er Straße .
drivers can then thread directly from the Hammer street to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic spl@@ its early , which improves the overall course of life on the busy section of the highway 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district council of Mu@@ enster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder anno@@ ys the drivers mostly between 17 and 19 .
on week@@ days , the back@@ stone goes up to the bridge over the Alber@@ go trail and sometimes beyond .
reason is the con@@ i@@ fer on the B 51 just before the exit of Wes@@ er Straße .
from here the traffic is guided only one lane by the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be disman@@ tled more than three quarters of a year ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer possesses the required load to absorb , above all , heavy duty traffic two @-@ lane .
the competent national operation cannot say how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the inter@@ connected factory traffic will last .
however , it has to be reck@@ oned with years : because the bridge has an official remaining service life up to the year 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the rule of law , the national company deliberately chose the bu@@ oy@@ ant time during the school holidays because of disability .
traffic is passed on the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural Journey : cultural Activities for Schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule attended the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Das invisible Haus &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are planning a music project .
N@@ ima &apos;s association enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Kinder@@ haus Wald@@ schule has visited the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Das invisible Haus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Theater Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; 19 students from eleven to 15 years visited the st@@ aging in the little house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims at the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit the cultural institutions in Münster in the context of this project .
most of the young people of the class came to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animation it was possible for them to follow the course of action nevertheless , the press release of the Young Theater Münster .
the N@@ ima &apos;s Association , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg , is a language school and the young theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project .
from October to December , young people with and without refugee and migration background will have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theat@@ rical voice mediation are planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
in view of the increased numbers of refugees , the association counts with many classes who want to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of weather
the weather has taken an account of the Stern@@ schn@@ u@@ ppen @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany in the night for Friday - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain to watch the spectacle of heaven , the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , said on Friday morning .
our hope lies on the night to Saturday .
the weather is supposed to be good , then we see many shooting stars in the sky .
the shooting stars are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which are one of the fastest shooting stars at 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
in the evening you roll around etern@@ ally , you lie awake for hours , in the morning it is already far before the alarm @-@ ring no more to think of sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not rest@@ ful .
how do sleeping problems or sleep disorders express themselves ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and many causes can be under@@ estimated , emphas@@ ised Hans @-@ Günter Gr@@ isons , member of the Executive Board of the German Society for S@@ leep and S@@ leep Medicine .
what we understand for the time being , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , thus an inhal@@ ation and sleep distur@@ b@@ ance .
especially the diar@@ rho@@ ea of many people feel un@@ satisfactory or insufficient , says Jens Wagen@@ kne@@ cht , member of the board at the German GP Association with practice in Var@@ el , Lower Saxony .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind it can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines .
in@@ frequently the sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early wake @-@ up is common in case of depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Weber . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that various factors condition each other .
for example , those who have a her@@ ni@@ ated failure can lie badly , wake up every two to three hours and may start to pon@@ der about everyday problems and worries , strikes an example .
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I go to the doctor with sleeping disorders ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor , inform the doctor .
the impairment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is slightly irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache .
in order to relieve sleep disorders , it is important to find out their causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medicines - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks .
there is hardly any resident sleeping medicine in Germany , emphasizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary S@@ leep Medicine Center of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
for this reason , in case of sleeping problems , one should first turn to the family doctor , advises Weber .
it can be clari@@ fied if the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep lab , and what will happen ?
for the examination in the sleep laboratory , doctors advise , for example , in snor@@ ing with breathing replac@@ ements , in case of illness of the day , in sleeping transform@@ ers or if one does not find the cause of a breakdown disorder , explains Fi@@ etze .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after cl@@ adding you go to bed at its normal time .
besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ g@@ og@@ gles , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger .
in addition , a camera draws the sleeping ends on the ceiling .
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a few adjusting screws where you can sleep for a better sleep .
shoot counts : regular sleeping and rising times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV for falling asleep , avoid alcohol and do not look at the clock at night - then one starts to reck@@ on immediately , and that is absolutely not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp has with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself as a dis@@ ap@@ pointing result of the dis@@ ap@@ pointing cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he first met gold at the Doh@@ a short @-@ track world champi@@ onships and at the same time exhibited his first world record .
the former DS@@ V @-@ ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler has now protected himself against his ex @-@ team@@ mates in his criticism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € bonus and a Dsch@@ ung@@ el@@ kö@@ nig of 15@@ 0.000 € , nobody should wonder about missing med@@ als , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old on his Facebook page last night . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conveying system in the swimming sport is bad , the dop@@ ing controls are very good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not see or even operate dop@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
that is exactly how it should be held with countries .
&quot; those who are not able to control a certain time before WM / OS from independent controllers of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; says the election @-@ ham@@ burger , who meanwhile operates an ice cream par@@ lor .
airport : gang of luggage thi@@ eves arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
on Thursday , two women and two men were arrested at the age of 50 to 61 .
the suspi@@ ci@@ ons had committed several bags and luggage thi@@ eves as a gang .
at 9 : 30 pm , civilian officials in the area of the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf airport once again recognised a gang that was known to polic@@ emen from past theft charges .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since mid @-@ July and were involved in a collaborative , pro @-@ social and professional manner .
the specialists of the Det@@ ective Security Council 34 can prove 4 actions to the thi@@ eves who had entered Germany for crimes committed in Germany .
in doing so , they had caught up over 15,000 Euros .
old buildings , a few lime trees , still a rest cob@@ ble@@ stones : the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain does not seem so at first sight , but the police count them among the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if one goes along the road from east to west , one passes through play@@ grounds , a fres@@ her kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spra@@ yed on the façade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
compared to a Li@@ dl , which is to be demoli@@ shed too soon , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments is to be built here by 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; articles about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as indicated by the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain , are however preferred over the past few weeks with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have le@@ ases , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
especially the Berlin interior sen@@ ator Henkel has repeatedly expressed itself for a hard action by the police against the project , the area referred to as &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as a point of departure of autonomous violence .
after the police cleared the rooms on the ground floor , the cad@@ re @-@ s@@ mi@@ ths , with 300 police officers , the police pat@@ rol three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew @-@ cars on site , blocked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94 .
meanwhile , the building workers were renov@@ ating the rooms on behalf of the unknown owner of the house .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal , and a day later police and construction workers mig@@ rated under the che@@ ering of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon , the road seems peaceful : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others chat before sp@@ ä@@ ti .
in the immediate vicinity of the house are a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in the neighbourhood since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who is moving three children here , are especially anno@@ yed by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who mostly wanted police protection from the v@@ and@@ ali@@ ent left .
the dit@@ ch , the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police between land@@ owners and their neighbours , obviously does not exist .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; district , which today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and has a high risk of poverty .
in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former G@@ DR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer Straße in the vicinity of the Riga .
while the Main@@ zer was ev@@ acu@@ ated under a lot of police orders in a regular battle , many of the projects in Riga were leg@@ alized and still today still inhabited by the people who occupied it 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district has become increasingly magnet for tourists and elec@@ tive people from all over the world over the past few years : with them residents from G@@ DR times and former house occup@@ iers are now sharing their neighbourhood .
this is also reflected in the r@@ ents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them against fan @-@ blown windows or newly painted facades , which were thrown with paint @-@ bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other street was mentioned this year along with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason why not all neighbours consider this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality : crimes like body injury are almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen .
most of the crimes are caused by damage , which tends to meet the new@@ buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rented house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
as for acts of violence , it is appe@@ asing : the people in the 94 are their neighbours who are certainly not .
even the famous burning cars no longer give it to the Rig@@ a@@ er anymore .
for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here you help each other , live together on the street and get more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is consciously drawn into the Riga road - and remains .
that is why it was so important that the local residents got back their streets : from the police , politicians and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district .
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : by fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former mos@@ quit@@ oes that disp@@ lace the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are fre@@ ehold flats that are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well @-@ charged are living here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can absolutely not appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should you do if you never listen to someone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , including the police and the residents .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for the extended ones who are anno@@ yed by color bom@@ b@@ ings : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the neighbourhood .
those who come here should be aware of this - just like someone who moves to a pub district , can complain badly about noise there .
all persons presented only with first names have asked not to be called by their proper name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new Refu@@ gee Officer
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the Refu@@ gee Officer for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social ped@@ agog@@ ue supports the team of the administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group refugee aid , administration , authorities and anyone else involved .
Reg@@ ine customer from the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is here , the aff@@ ection@@ ate wool mil@@ ch@@ sau , which has a problem above all .
in this way , some - less laugh@@ ing but rather focused on the multitude of tasks desired - meant that the administration wanted to write the job .
looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , an aff@@ ection@@ ate lust for pleasure .
but administration is not her central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le means .
above all , it is about organization , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as networking activities .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has limited a 50 percent job for three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports hon@@ e- and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems .
new containers will soon be available in the Was@@ en@@ strasse
a serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection provision .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or hired residential premises .
the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the district office to the municipality and Job@@ centers .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time .
de facto , the administration does not find private apartments .
up to now , it does not work , so be dependent on private dwell@@ ings , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common homes need to be intim@@ id@@ ated , as it is so beautiful .
new containers will soon be installed in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but it is not only with apartments .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine Kunde and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a fixed stay there are intern@@ ships , apprentices@@ hips , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine client .
many work in the building yard or help house masters , do non @-@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy according to Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so I need offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so there is also administration and volunteers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must explain to the refugees that it simply takes and they can bridge the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever develops the feeling at some point , he can &apos;t help in Ur@@ bach , do not work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate .
the clear majority was motivated .
but there are problems too , the customer hon@@ estly says , &quot; People who don &apos;t do anything at all . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and the customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : do the two after the latest incidents fear radic@@ alisation , even in a small community such as Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine client says quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some nai@@ ve may call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a residual risk could and would not exclude them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also the subject of refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins will completely re@@ inv@@ ent them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
