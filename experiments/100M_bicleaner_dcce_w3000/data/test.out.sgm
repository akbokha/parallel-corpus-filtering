<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer visited with some colleagues a bit of diversion with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes the horses recalled their evening, they drove home to the feeding troughs in a quick gallop.</seg>
<seg id="7">One kilometre at this pace, I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says.</seg>
<seg id="9">And so the riding career ended up again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He let himself lead his family over the system of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even bother for photographic purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and therewith also at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sporting aid presented the man from Schaffhausen in the framework of a small gala in the Golden Sports Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">The likeable athlete has no shortage of awards.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silver laurel leaf, Champions-Tour-Player of the Year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen had already adsorbed him.</seg>

<seg id="20">"" "" "" "this award means a lot to me," "" "says Langer," "" "because it is awarded not only for athletic successes but also for social commitment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">For decades, Langer has been promoting junior employees.</seg>

<seg id="23">"" "with 15 other outstanding sportsmen, the two-time US master winner was added to the" "" "Hall of Fame des deutschen Version" "" "on Saturday." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">The athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the gymnner Eberhard Gienger, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob driver Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the Springreiter Alwin Schockemöhle and posthum of the handball Erhard Wunderlich.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sportsmen came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy in Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">The two U.S. presidents, however, are undivided in tax and energy policies as well as in a fundamental issue.</seg>
<seg id="4">The difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical distinction.</seg>
<seg id="5">The one about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump is in doubt rather small and cautions about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wanted to control the economy and regulate it to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will drastically withdraw regulations, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "Clinton, on the other hand, says:" "" "the state has certain tasks to fulfil, it has to open up disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes for the rich would increase, they say.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the need to be invested, Trump and Clinton are almost worrying.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic applicant is even announcing the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">Government investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly denied by the state-critical TeBonapartist wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">Therefore still party internal discussions could come to Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Pump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive the coal mining to the US again.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "oil production should also be possible in protected areas so far, he wants to cancel the Paris climate protection agreement." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "Clinton, on the other hand, wants to extend the renewables" "" "renewables" "" "with its investment program:" "" "a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in the infrastructure - even when it comes to international trade agreements, the two competitors are not far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both TPP, the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement, do not want to sign them.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both, however, do not want to isolate the US from international trade, but simply want to better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should also be paid better, says Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger-wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to be up, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand, Trump is standing, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics observed him, so that the budget deficit would only be greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least the rich want them to pay more taxes, and whose critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every winged woman has experiences with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence is part of everyday life for women who are fleeing alone.</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers shelter.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen, four women sit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby at the most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has placed her little son in her arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curiously in the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares on the table-top.</seg>

<seg id="12">The scene is normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you talk with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is the division manager of Condrobs, a carrier for social aid services in Bavaria, and is concerned with the topic of women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are refugees.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralised accommodations for women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich women's aid.</seg>
<seg id="18">It has been officially opened recently.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men do not exist - even not as visitors.</seg>

<seg id="22">"" "" "" "it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her escape," "" "says Bahr." ""</seg>

<seg id="24">"" "in women, other reasons predominate:" "" "many steal away from it because they see no other way out." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">In their homeland, they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, volunteering, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">That drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run, this goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "that tugboats for example require a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a rarity," "" "says Bahr." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "whoever believes that the end, as soon as she comes to Germany, is mistaken," "" "says Bahr." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">Here too, single women in refugee camps would often be considered inferior and abused in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="32">This leads to approximately 90 percent of women who live in the housing in the north of Munich are traumatized, they appreciate.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "some of the children are certainly not voluntary." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are used to saying nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "or they dare not speak openly about what they have experienced because the shame is too great." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">Since they often don't know to help, it needs more accommodations just for them, says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the question of whether they knew about a similar project like Munich in their sphere of jurisdiction, some answer with no.</seg>
<seg id="39">There is no such thing in the Oberpfalz region and Oberfranken in such a way that there is no such thing in the governments' lodgings.</seg>
<seg id="40">Even in Swabia, only escaped women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Lower Franconia, there are floors or houses for single women and their children in some community shelters.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations only for women.</seg>

<seg id="2">Assistant physicians have called upon their union to approve new labour campaigns in their dispute regarding a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) called for its entire Council to approve more labor campaign activities from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that ministers would have agreed to respond to the concerns about the contract.</seg>

<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in favor of the elections.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands and announce an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I can not resist the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was a handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile seemed to be palpable and he hardly radiated warmth, even for his restrained conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke of his" "" "love friend" "" "Putin - according to a report all five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan was so benign as if something bad had never happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">It seemed to me that his enthusiasm was rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable coolness showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in his introductory words: the shot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at the time was raging.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The crime was even greater, as it was done by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Rebuilding the veto becomes difficult, if not impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media launched a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were the allegations of senior officials that Erdogan had benefited his own family from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he has been relieved of almost his office last month with a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the State television forecasted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemsti put it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes are long here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious at the West, as it regards its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "this includes the continuing grudge on the snail empower of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce Turkey's relationship to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara for ensuring that after the attempted coup d "état, he demanded support for the elected state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit meeting in this splendid palace on the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to portray an "alliance of outsiders" as an analyst once described: two countries that violate the West and feel badly treated and now unite.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks both presidents informed that they had not even stripped the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences while Putin decided to stress them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and considering the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey dropped the Russian combat jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State are at least once again talking to each other.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed Sergei Ivanov's chief of staff.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV has been part of Putin's closest trust for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for environmental and transport affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin, Mr Putin ordered" "" "the release Ivanovs from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration without giving reasons." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been an actuator since 2012, has been appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin, it is called (in Russian) that he later was the director and Chief of Staff of the Government Staff.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the government's most important task to support your activity as head of state concerning bills and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin informed the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces convincing?</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow has made this step mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidantes and works as he did for the Soviet Intelligence Service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who once was promoted as a potential president - would like to lead Russian environmental policy - met with great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin, quoted on the website of the Kremlin, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - to confide in embarrassing posts for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin reached power, he named Ivanov one of five people whom he trusted the most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once believed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become President of Russia, because Putin had violated the constitution for a third term.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, close allies of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the northern deck of Queensland crossings with the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closures of the" "" "ceiling blowers" "", "which approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 skive ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown already paid a visit to the construction site and was one of the first to go to the Bridge from the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historic and symbolic moment when building Queensland crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnessing an engineering art of a truly epic extent in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, nearly 79% of the whole deck of the deck are at their place and the last section of the deck is given a gong for the deck today in Rosyth, which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "Michael Martin, project manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" "" "the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">In this fantastic project the closure is pioneering construction and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last layer of road and its connection with the northern turmdeck located in the expansion, we had to close the still existing gap on the north or side of the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters in the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massively, since the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approx. 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate as the tolerances on which the team were working, they were tiny - on each side they ruined only a few millimeters.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a chase for health and happiness that is worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">Teenagers and children don't go outside to play outside, but rather prefer spending their free time with staring on screens, in the last decade of many complaining.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and last on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, I refer to Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s (later derived from a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop culture phenomena, interest in the game was falling in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the servers overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémons which are tracked with a GPS and, once they have been found, "photographed" (using a screenshot on the mobile) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the delusion and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in the U.S., the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the" "" "average" "" "person restores each day." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, who pursued 35.000 users, recently informed the Washington Post that within two days of launching the game, the number of subsequent people who exercise every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it just sees the raw data for improving performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns for health, people want to" "" "take 30 minutes" "" "to" "" "come down from the sofa" "" "and" "" "be active every day" "", "because many public messages are boring and come from people looking miserable." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sports cannot be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Anyone who regularly drives sport reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even join new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As usual, there are also some stormy perishers, who always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it do?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough came into being.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even though Smartphone-Apps like Fitbit could already track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sports as this game does.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will fade away with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemons's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world and help many people hunting, more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="2">Forget the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="3">Forget the hype.</seg>
<seg id="4">Simone Biles is immune to all that.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dynamic on the jumping horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortless on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Stunningly on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">All the way brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally the Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast cluttered on Thursday for the title of the campaign and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all the eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her total score of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team-team Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medallist Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American women Simone Biles is on the balance beam during the single multi-campaign of women in the gymnastics at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Bilo is the fourth heterosexual American woman who wins a multi-campaign title and is the fifth as she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her end result was shown and her long journey at that moment was ending.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated the last three years of her sport, 15 world champion medals - including 10 gold medals - with amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Retton told her that she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">She expected it to be a final exam in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be seen as disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American actresses Simone Biles, on the left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the single multi-stage competition of women in the gymnastics at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles won the first medal on Tuesday while she served as an exclamation mark on the farewell party of the retired manna curator Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted that, during their long journey to the top, never planned the future, that is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their soil exercises - containing their typical Tumbling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympiaarena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boormans' mother during a school excursion in the gymnasium, was exercised in the Boorman.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, she has lost no more competition competition, a winning streak that will last as long as Biles wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though Mustafa was slightly led by two turns, the picture was deceptive.</seg>
<seg id="27">Aerial beams and soil gymnastics - in which Biles holds the world title of the world - were lurking.</seg>
<seg id="28">She recovered again with 15,433 on the balance beam - and with a 15,933 on the ground another on it.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her gently as she expected her grandson - a pure formality - and tears poured in bright red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her book-book became a reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance of Raismans was a vengeance for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafa in a Tiebrake.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time, the 22-year-old team captain, who is called "Grandma" by the Americans, had a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After her exercise, she threw the audience to the public, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="33">As regards Biles, the rapidly expanding Tweet of the 19-year-old has a whole new meaning from the beginning of this week:</seg>

<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12th, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The perpetrator fired eight shots from a firearm, while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle, to read in the report.</seg>
<seg id="5">The police told us that the triple murder did not seem to be the result of a robbery, because the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 which were owned by one of the adult victims.</seg>
<seg id="6">The police spokesman of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting led investigators to take a closer look at whether they were connected with four previous attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">A total of seven people were killed in nine attacks during the period of four months and two others were injured.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it is happening in a residential area in front of a house," says Howard der KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, beginning of the month.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles, including a brown Nissans from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.</seg>
<seg id="10">The investigators refused to disclose the evidence they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same murderer.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to their injuries and died later.</seg>
<seg id="12">Liner, 31, and Ellis's daughter Maleah died on site.</seg>
<seg id="13">A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="14">The authorities also published a police report on the shooting which picked up an empty Pickup truck half an hour before tripled murder and assumed that it was the work of serial killer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heavy rainfalls and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to call on the emergency stand on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Numerous rivers in the south-east of Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi flooded their shores and threatened with large-scale flooding after extreme rainfalls, the National Weather Service reported.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards said that civil servants are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the way to the communities affected.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the Governor, announced that the requests for flood vessels, boats and sand bags increased.</seg>
<seg id="6">Steele said that only the municipality of Tangipahoa would have requested ten thousand sandbags.</seg>
<seg id="7">A flood warning system is used over large parts in the south of Louisiana to Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="8">The weather service announced that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches could fall in rain.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the south of Alabama a flood warning system was used on Friday as it continued to rain in the mobile area.</seg>
<seg id="10">The River Comite near Baton Rouges and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both of which are located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="11">The metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses near the vicinity of Baton Rouge.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish is a danger, as these rivers only slowly flow into Lake Maurepas through the trodden rivers.</seg>
<seg id="13">The river Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, already reached the highest level on Friday at 09.00, which was ever recorded.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rescue teams still sent people out of the flood water in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the south-west of Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="15">Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those who were saved on Friday near Gloster.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house, greatly increased overnight.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that another stepson who lives nearby would have warned him.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "we woke up and the water streamed and poured in," "" "said Hansford." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">It reached my waist.</seg>
<seg id="20">His wife told Hansford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years in which she lived there.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hansford said he and his family members would have all obstructions and he would be the only one who can swim.</seg>
<seg id="22">Hansford said that all three had saved all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were accommodated until Friday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Krautmann said that the flood had" "" "quickly spread" "" "because it continued to have heavy rainfalls and that the authorities would be considering evacuation instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Krautmann, an observer announced near Livingstone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches of rain.</seg>
<seg id="25">Krautmann said that the ground by the rainfall has been considerably balanced since Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="26">The authorities stated that heavy rainfalls and flooding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and classroom failure in five districts.</seg>
<seg id="27">The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that there were 200 flooded houses in Tangipahoa.</seg>
<seg id="28">The inhabitants were evacuated in two churches, which were now both flooded.</seg>
<seg id="29">The leader of the Robby Miller community said the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets that were rinsed by floods.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the towns of Amite and Hammond, emergency lodgings were created to accommodate the evacuation.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "as soon as the water begins to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">In the town of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa, almost two dozens of roads were closed due to the floods and sandbags were provided for the residents to take part, hoping to keep the water from their houses and shops.</seg>
<seg id="33">"the last major inundation we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum from the city administration.</seg>
<seg id="34">This seems to be a similar incident.</seg>
<seg id="35">In Mississippi, the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison Countys said that it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast.</seg>
<seg id="36">According to his statements a handful of houses were reported to be flooded on Thursday, but on Friday no reports have been reported.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine under the women's Olympics in the gymnastics and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, since 1984 I have been with every summer Olympics and the USA has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewdin and Madison's Kocian, the Catholics, round off, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one female female female female was an Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic Champion and a jubilee.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they provided unexpected but masterful gyms routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold in an individual multi-campaign event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but gymnastics throughout the country do not look like this.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "", "because the next Olympic team will only have four female gymnasts in the team. it is also the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts mainly in private gymnastics which are maintained by parents responsible for training, teaching, travel, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turntables lie in prosperous suburbs that can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs the gymnasts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, trained their athletes since they started the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to give the communities an innumerable, young girl who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie to make a more affordable and easier to access gym training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my turnstile of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">In my events we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youngsters (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high-quality gymnastics that will make it possible to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team, bringing thousands of young girls to care for the gymnastics, and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by holding the Olympic team square and thank you for motivating so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed treaty with the functionaries of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37.000 assistants who voted in favour of a vote refused.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "in July Hunt had revealed plans to introduce the treaty, and said that the NHS was in a" "" "No Man's Land" "" "and would be damaging any further delay for the employees and patients." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">The first assistance physicians should receive a new contract which includes changes to night and weekend festivities in order to improve the care for ongoing hours.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA Committee for Assistant Physicians, announced last night in a message: "assistance doctors have still considered serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially that it will heat up the current workforce crisis and fail to treat all doctors."</seg>
<seg id="6">With only eight weeks left until the first group of doctors falls under the new contract, progress must be made and the time runs out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts by the BMA to resolve disputes by means of talks have met with the government on the contrary, and sometimes on deafening silence.</seg>
<seg id="8">This happened when Jeremy Hunt made it last month that his door would always be open.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "Jeremy Hunt must act now, raise the constraint and address the concerns of the assistance doctors." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="12">The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed treaty with the functionaries of the British Medical Association.</seg>

<seg id="16">Over the last two months we have spoken to the Committee of the Assistant Physicians and responded favorably to the concerns about tutelage and whistle-bustle with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.</seg>
<seg id="17">Employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training sessions, additional training for those who come back from vocational training, training courses, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training holidays and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious the employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health related to the agreement with the BMA in November, February and May were.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it more secure for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We talked to Rhone Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Confederation in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a close distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to turn the spear around for your robber.</seg>
<seg id="5">When you move from behind you should turn around as first, so that you can see your attacker and move out of the shot, "says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Then take the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting your face with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Strike him then with his knee in the chest and twist, while the attacker crumbs against pain, the weapon from his hands. beat him with the barrel into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker can't shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Shift the weight to the weapon at the same time and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the gun from its grip before moving backwards and directing the gun to it.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveler underwent a serious test of his immune system and stranglehold by leaking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk threw his train on a euro note, a handrail at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before the screening of each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he is going to get.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment that was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" brought some surprising results.</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea of detecting the rinsing toilet of a train toilet which has been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately nothing left what he licked off, more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resilience of his intestines by travelling through the world and ate strange and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public vestments at railway stations to flushing buttons of toilets, the task assigned its immune system definitively under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told: "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was able to do justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial period showed a luminometric total of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the luminometric rate of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet which he refused to refuse, after their luminance count was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different locations such as the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "that comes close to the worst I have smelled in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing worse than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick here, because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Shafts and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "" "we really wanted to offer something new to the consumers." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explain the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "we conducted crazy brainstorming that ended with saying" "" "Call us Ian." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the meaning of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary, we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the film, added: "let me tell you that - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things that I had told him to lick, just like the disgusting Russian toilet which is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to check them out and others where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria, in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asoziale family left their social housing after a delogization with a loss of £50,000 because they had terrorized their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After they were forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing association found the property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls showed striking holes, wooden planks were torn, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is assumed that they now live in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for the people and I think that people don't have to live in this way.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider as this property is thought to be considered as not so beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror inflicted by the family had embraced street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screams, strikers and flukes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house, which may be torn down under certain circumstances, old rubbish was found</seg>
<seg id="14">They were piled up in the estate in which drugs were traded in the past</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbors said they had to fight them on the street and regularly called the police</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing deloded her and her partner forcibly from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogization was cheered by facilitated neighbours who said that their lives were made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "one said," "" "They weren't afraid of anybody." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have missed the family to cooperate with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police was called at regular intervals for 20 years</seg>
<seg id="26">Garbage and old toys were thrown down on the overgrown side of the church building</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he added," "" "It is a shame that the tenant will reject all responsibility for their behavior and family, as delogization is always the last step that Cornwall Housing is considering." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case, as the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be awful for their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work that my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have given us the information we have provided.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message conveys that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delogiation on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers of the house administration will now have to sweep away garbage mountains that surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">In 2014, the police conducted a raid in the house and found more than 70g cannabis as well as balances, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £1,700.</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon received a fine after owning the owner of a class B drug in commercial custody.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed that the money was a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in 2013 in a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="37">After they were without shelter, Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.</seg>
<seg id="38">Many room walls of the house were greased with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police say that they are lessee who do not stick to the house rules</seg>

<seg id="7">This was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by the doping controllers.</seg>

<seg id="4">In 2021, the Parliament's Parliament elections will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin parliament decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>

<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be convinced by the election fighters, are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the vacationers in the country, on the island of Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so you are not allowed to choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: during the holidays there are helpers who hang up posters, blow up balloons, distribute flyers, and count voices in the end, only to grind.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until the 4th of September 2016, the election and last holiday-day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to let go of an election campaign close to the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his ministry.</seg>

<seg id="9">Since the construction site was moved to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the asphalt road in Ofterdingen was lifted and the connection to Rottenburg exists again, the traffic situation within the place has eased.</seg>

<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas were franchising.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the speed limits were not met, the congregation challenged the vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>

<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 rehabilitation has led to revenue breakthroughs allows everyone to look through.</seg>

<seg id="29">"" "not only it, but all the restaurants" "" "hit hard" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, President President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by Göhner if there could be a financial compensation, with the hint that the restaurant would benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties where so much more generously handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all complaints, Göhner is confident that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, family operations have been settled here since 1715, pointing to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">It can be understood that other regular guests are now less frequent due to the complicated traffic guidance.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you cannot ride, it is also somewhere else beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubt that his family-clientele comes back after the renovation works.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction on its clientele for the biggest crisis, which has experienced its restaurant in its long-standing history.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle-aged love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you wander to the comment section to see him under the pseudonym nonsensical men of the middle ages with rough insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the much discussed re-emergence of records is not attributable to a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects but to Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight according to the age of 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes of hobby collectors - it has an emotional impact: older record buyers will retain their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending their time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov vote?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog was a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit and stuffed wild before I stand still, hold my hands and say something better like: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there are still a handful of fantastic record specialist shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera off for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to several men in such shops and try to evaluate their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, from Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three middle aged men) to Reckless Records (number of data: eight men middle aged, one woman, probably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I guess," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have some 3,000 or 4,000 slabs.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him at home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and buying items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things in which I was probably something too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot.</seg>
<seg id="21">That is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets have to apply to YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and are looking to buy back their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations that I have led, people usually get rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to trailers of the plate revivals of a particular age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to the WEZ, some of the older customers took notice of the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retire to the stability of familiar record covers, from objects that call for happy cheering.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says WEZ.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it's like that for many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to engage spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "an employee flirts from a record pile." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">An ICM survey in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to it.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not have a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very worried, while browsing through a stack of Bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works with Sounds of the Universe (number of data: three middle aged men) has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone just came here recently and said," "" "I don't have record players, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead sound record so I can put them on the shelf," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musical.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say," "" "I don't have a record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, who only slowly come in.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has dedicated the records to almost a whole floor, has a lower audience than I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts's latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz thunderous from the loudspeakers - it's good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks odd, but the mental trauma is hard to find when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the shop for a few minutes and considers the variety of records to be sold.</seg>
<seg id="49">It makes a window-shopping rather than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve much, so collecting disks is not a real option, they say.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or another way, but the beauty of records is... "it drives away with a dearest sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the impression to pattern the pants' pants' pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls, who group for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a Crosley turntable.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far up that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group, who has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research revealed that the results of YouGov vote, they are not taken into account, at least in record stores in Soho, the great number of female collectors who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with security not wander through records of Berwick Street and sheets, while they steer from the staring look of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator who overlooks the shoulders of nothing of middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a trial this week the authorities argued in Calais that the state should be authorised to submit 72 temporary shops in which people within the camp sell goods, cigarettes to energydrinks, sell barber services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be pulled down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would pose a risk of fire and sanity.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups told the Court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-assisted union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also learned that temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the deportation of people who operate 72 provisional businesses, but admitted that the concerns raised by the Prefecture of Calais were absolutely plausible. "</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feeding people living in extremely precarious conditions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He said the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by the Dutch was the camp's Jungle Book Kids' café dedicated to serving English and French classes along with 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids' café.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at 7-7 rugby came to an abrupt halt on Thursday evening at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were struck in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the Pomodoro Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji gave a master class in handling, side-stepping, back, line running, and raw power to win gold - its first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was lost due to the not too bad trophy of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The marked defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of that, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for UK - but it will probably not - that at least a Briton will have a gold medal tomorrow at his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, former head of England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind it.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, Ryan lost every game at Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they just lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This hatch will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wonderful and allowed the attacks to bounce GBs out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. an, as if one would run into running buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 upwards when Osea Kolinisau was in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With just four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he turned around.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A gripping Tackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain from Sierra Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute lete jasa Veremalua in the right corner went a touch down and it was 0-17 for the UK.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the revival and there was still more than a minute of playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou was raging through other weak tacklings of the UK team and stormed to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still taught.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is the way it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB took basic changes to half-time and closed the fijian gap... for a whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua toured Tuiova after a brilliant intermediate play by Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for the UK, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was long in favor of the South Seeinsulans, whose fans sang, flags wave and danced on the grandstand.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliam put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Pfiff rang, the Fijis hugged and GB crushed crushing in the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day Fiji Japan defeated in the semifinals with 20-5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa in a tight semi-finalist match from the race - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown put the buks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no more emochastic gold than with these games and that will mean what.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first strokes up to the last, 220 hard Hieve, who enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though there were only the two who were sitting at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the coach Robin Williams, was omnipresent when she ruined the second Olympic-old in a second without a tax-woman in a row, the first women in the history of British sport, who laid on such a standard.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her dominance was absolute, after all her 39.7 idle time, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athletins that glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the nature of the triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers who make a difference to the incremental advances that make the difference, and no one was more helpful than the coach who did not know about 30 months ago if he was diagnosed with cancer this day.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer that is operable and that they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little bit the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he was able to begin treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if that under such circumstances is the right concept at all.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to get better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is already a challenge, but it makes it even bigger.</seg>

<seg id="7">"" "the work of the" "" "Veitenstein Group" "" "applies" "" "Bavaria far as exemplary." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="8">Behind all this, Rupert Göller, who was 31 years in the kennel association, stands for 28 years as managing director.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drinking water purpose association of the Veitenstein group, based in Kottendorf, municipality Breitbrunn, transports approximately 150000 cubic metres of water annually and supplies 32 places and hamlets with approximately 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">Member communities are the municipalities Kirchwald, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are water supply contracts for other towns and communities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairman, Breitbrunn Bürgermeisterin Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was employed as a waterkeeper in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zweckverband in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organization activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions as well as emergencies at weekends," said the chairman.</seg>
<seg id="15">As an outstanding event she called the inauguration and inauguration of the new fountain (1994), land purchases in the area of the new fountain (1998) and compensation of the farmers, the renovation of the elevated tanks (1999), the re-purchase of a central computer control system (2004) and the replacement of parts of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There have been no standstill and I have always added new things because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her speech she praised Gol's faithful, reliable and correct service for over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He used a lot of lifeblood for his water purpose association and he lived downright to the water-purpose association as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein group for nitrate reduction in front of the water forum of Lower Franconia.</seg>
<seg id="20">For this he received very much recognition and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller, on his part, praised waterborne Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best man and he was a faithful snack.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">As highlights from his point of view he described the well-building and the restructuring of the Zweckverband.</seg>
<seg id="25">The biggest challenge and the most difficult task were the tubing at the high-rise in Kirchwald on a 3rd January.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night so that the villages could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">Even the supply of new brunn can only be maintained because one filled the high container from Pettstadt with hoses.</seg>

<seg id="2">The crisis-packed and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared from additional costs in millions of dollars.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens arising from the branch of green electricity production are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains with the release of the renewable energy environment in the existing systems for the so-called self-current production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "I am really happy that after two years we could finally reach negotiations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission initially planned to ask the steel producers to use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel told the WAZ, there is now a statement with the European Commission following talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators are replaced in the steel works an EEG levy of 20 percent is required.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even these are not levied in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on electricity generation.</seg>

<seg id="21">On the one hand, hand-imposed import duties on import steals have effect, on the other hand the economic outlook in China has risen.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least the prices would have stagnated.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry reacts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">Last but not least ThyssenKrupp wanted to close the closure of individual works.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing is good for seniors</seg>
<seg id="2">Ursel Kipp has already accompanied her whole life: as a young girl she was in school choir, she taught music in the school choir, and today the 78-year-old sings in a Senior Citizens Choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "singing moves me - emotionally and physically," "" "she describes." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and a total livelier, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good for her health and spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, Erhard Hackler says about the German seniors division.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most senior citizens sing in the chorus and share with like-minded the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular meetings, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Often social and family structures dissolve in age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "to speak and organize, to be able to rely on others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For doing so, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly request their lungs will not get so quickly out of the dolls in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also when it comes to getting the sound of the voice at age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">For older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Working Group for Senior Citizens.</seg>
<seg id="16">Common singing had a much higher priority in the older generations; it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, it explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people awakens many memories, often connected with positive emotions of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and particularly melodies, even dementia sufferers devise themselves to long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, a special performance is required for the head, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">To concentrate on one's own voice and rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a major cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just elderly people who live alone practice so not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition you experience through singing in the choir, Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I do something for a long time, I become better and awoke beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Whoever wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate, even if he thinks he has little talent, says Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who can hear when a sound goes wrong?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the appropriate offer, senior citizens have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone from the circle of acquaintances sings in a senior choir, you can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Anyone who wants to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found via the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbours for help with the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Anyone who wants to sing should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does good for the soul and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="8">According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">Friday morning two explosives went up again, and according to the authorities another person was killed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Also from Phuket a bomb explosion was reported in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">A taxi driver was injured in the detonation in the vicinity of the bathing beach in Patong, which was popular with vacationers.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country another bomb exploded which killed a municipal employee.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the sentence has gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the territorial police precinct.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast and in Chumphon on the south-east coast demanded several injuries.</seg>
<seg id="15">It was said that there was a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "the bomb attacks bear the same handwriting," "" "said army general Danai Kritomavee Friday morning before journalists." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "we assume that it is a coordinated attack." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">It is too early to express themselves on possible motives - but it is probably a matter of the actions of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern that is typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist uprising movement or with international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather, one assumes that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">In recent days, the authorities had kept secret references to forthcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed of the exact time and places.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police instructed their officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand there are always smaller bombings, but they are mostly not directed against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin is a palace that was used over the years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">Following the long bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is recommending to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.</seg>
<seg id="29">High safety level (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="30">After disputes between security forces and Muslim populations, not necessary trips to these provinces will be discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased safety level (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday were held a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military great influence over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "Junta CEO and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country moves towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">The military unta, who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, resisted itself to have led the kingdom to stability and order again.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military has not managed to get a grip on the revolting uprising of Muslim rebels who have been fighting for years in the extreme south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Almost a year ago in Bangkok at a stop at a popular Hindu shrine 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the bloodiest attack on the recent history of the country.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Olympic Games or the world records do not always determine the headlines of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous performance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmers from Ethiopia were so slow that at times he was no longer seen in the TV pictures.</seg>
<seg id="5">He just disappeared - no matter how wide the cut-out was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">In social networks, Habré was subsequently transformed into a viral drug.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, the 24-year-old ended up with a gap of 48 seconds and finished 59th place of 59 starters.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not exactly athletic figure, which attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why does the 24-year-old participate in the Olympics?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian received a special startright from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries more well-known.</seg>
<seg id="12">As most sportsmen are running in Ethiopia, Habré wanted to do something different.</seg>

<seg id="1">The fees per cubic metre of sewage amount from 1 October 2016 for the area of the sewage plant Neudorf / Reuth / Welschahl 3.44 instead of 2.10 euros; for Zulte berg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3,36 euros (until now 2.26 euros) and for Azore 3.64 Euro (up to now 2.18 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="2">In the case of the plant in Azendorf, the waste water fee will be increased at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a rough calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf is then 4.37 euros per cubic meter.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, in the approval of the household by the district office Kulmbach, established that for these sewage plants undercover runs.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal basis, the market of Kasendorf is obliged to charge the facilities at a cost-covering basis.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of October 1, 2016, the citizens and the commercial and industrial companies from Welschahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Administrative Director Herbert Schmidt showed the body, a new calculation of fees for the wastewater treatment of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over and over-covers from the previous calculation period will also be equalized.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt founded the serious fee increases with the fact that all three wastewater facilities were relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack, which was between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, due to the low distribution basis, expenditures for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a grave effect.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">In spite of their age, refurbishment and repair expenses, in the recumbent period of the calculation, refurbishment and repair expenses were to a considerable extent.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plant in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the facilities for Welschahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultiberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt proved that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the sewer system Azendorf because of damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the pumping station Welschahl, the almost 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from the ground up and after almost 20 years of operation the first sewage pond had to be disposed of, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation option had to be installed in order to meet the water-legal requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "Schmidt:" "" "for these extraordinary expenses, the continued maintenance and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account in the new calculation period, came into consideration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which were still considerably below the current level during the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that in the case of low waste water, the expenses for operation and maintenance were "fully pierced" in the three plants.</seg>
<seg id="20">In doing so, Schmidt, the market community of large-scale maintenance costs in the sewer systems, has remained spared over the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="21">According to the view of stone houses, the situation for the aforementioned plants will remain precarious in the long run, especially as one cannot expand the supply area of the Friesenbachtal sewage association in order to not expand these facilities because they are deficient facilities.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" effect as Asian cartoon criticized</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat states that this filter is anime inspired, but some observers say that it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders on the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can transform yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are blunt, self-rotating tools that generate more than 30 million selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All missteps will reach the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have taken criticism in the past in which they were charged that the app would propagate Blackmore or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week suggested a filter to some users, who gave them mud-eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called a racist cartoon of Asians - "yellow face."</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked whether these repeated controversies pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat told that it would have deactivated the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as an homage to anime characters rather than caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who experienced racism reminded the filter of injurious clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American student whose tweets were widely spread over the photos, wrote that the filter was "vulnerable and easy to say."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the juxtaposition of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellowish, but that the yellow face has been pulled into the degrading extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride party.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and devices that we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats large audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older counterparts - could be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "when one of Snapchats filters creates a picture that is insulting for a user," "" "it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed than it was earlier," "" "said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete their Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay on medium and in a telephone interview she said that they believe that racial controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the settings practices of Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the large part white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that has largely left the Snapchat unanswered.</seg>

<seg id="1">Military guide falsifies ISIS intelligence, establishes committee of the Congress</seg>
<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command have changed intelligence intelligence to sign an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual conditions on the ground have allowed an investigation committee of the Congress to report in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of Republican members of the combatant committee, intelligence service committees and military budget committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence agencies who reported how superiors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, short cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence intelligence, typically strangled by high-level CentCom commanders, recorded a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism as the actual conditions on the ground had allowed, and were consistently positive as the analysis of other intelligence agencies," a newspaper article cited the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives, noted.</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership error in the CentCom reaches to the top of the organisation.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there are no direct indications that government leaders have given instructions under Obama to change reports, it shows how analysts faced the pressure from their superiors to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements in front of the congress were clearly more positive than the facts." "" "the report noted." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossules could start in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigation, it is so clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the Central Command heads changed intelligence reports to reduce the risk of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force into life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed information during the investigations.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigation of the CentCom reports is ongoing with the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years 2014 and 2015, CentCom created an excessively limited process for the preparation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced the highest-ranking Demokrat in the Committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process, Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "said the moral under analysts and" "" "gave excessively low space for diverging opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Ship and the Democrats stated that there was no indication of a White House intervention in the CentCom analysts as regards a "specific political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "the preliminary results of the investigation of the congress were published on Tuesday through" "" "The Daily Beast." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's chief inspector, who had been inscribed after complaints by CentCom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence does not comment on the reports of the Congress, while the investigation of the Inspector is still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also stated that" "" "experts sometimes have diverging opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense have welcomed a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">The allegations of last year have raised the question whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of more than ten years ago when a CentCom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a writing about how the then government under George W. Bush approached the recommendations of many analysts but had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker stated that contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This recognition, however, was not published, reported the Times in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damaliger Command, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature for its excessively positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin was retired in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after she shot three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she could not remember that ever done.</seg>

<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two teams will take the first and second place within their group of six teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed will be a little longer on the way to the strong Dutch who lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game may go out on Saturday, the American women have triggered a surprising swirl through their success story four years after they ended up in the last 12 seats at the last London Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time in three years she had a hockey stick in her hands (her two older sisters played sport at Drexel University), with 16 years she became the national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympiad in 2008, because she couldn't qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>

<seg id="17">We did not have the jobs in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have completely snatched the rudder.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening, Bam opened the doorway in the first half of the game with a backlash from the close-up area.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone into play without a victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the middle and drew the ball to the gate to get the American female a 2-0 guide.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the goalkeeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the middle of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Rio de Janeiro events feel consistent and inevitable, a rapid relay race between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning staff, which is handed from the wristband to a swimmers to the gymnast for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's conversation in the coffee shop, without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the quarrel between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there's Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time with the Olympic Games and a flock of women with dimples, could well have been among these well-known names sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising, if he were a swimmers, gymnasts or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting gold in the Olympic Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shade are the sports that are not universally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swimming and may it rule for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I have modest arguments for my particular favourite, then let me draw attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline jump has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, it was noticed the last 16 years so sparsely that many of those I had questioned did not know that it is a sport of the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to compete, it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had an athlete until 2012, who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians are inclined to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jump has a certain outsider charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clown school that sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a devoted enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristic potential - the kartoonish trembling of its never-ending bouncing - but also the grazie of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially unites it.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means much like" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging victors jumping on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, pike and ointtos) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "according to the official Olympic program, they are evaluated according to the variant, degree of difficulty and" "" "flight time" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-and-a-half athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists need to go further, faster, up and down in their quest to gold, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes towards and back, up and down at the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They not only chase the finish line or the starting wall, but also a further highlight in the television transmission: the world or the Olympiarekords.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented aspiration is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel a bit tiring when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">Of this, the trampoline offers a breathing break.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward motion is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even here there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant repeal of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen like the competition can only be at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days starting from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the angling and object tification of male athletes - as the male US Turner recently proposed to the The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley anticipates his new fan base according to air.</seg>

<seg id="4">Witnesses testified that, during the clashes with the police, umpteen protesters were killed during the clashes with the police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just collapsing?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the past ten years, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West, with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests erupted against the government and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the government's response was relentless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>

<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa, the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous African country in Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">U.S. military and secret services work closely with Ethiopians to fight terrorists across the region, especially in Somalia. few countries in Africa, if ever, receive so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Although Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy, human rights organisations have continually led repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, with dissidents being effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile, or sent to prison, killed or driven into the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," "" "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopian." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous grievances that cover everything from land use to stranglehold in terms of power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following a widespread election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists such as the Ogaden Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been forced more or less forced over the past few years, can use turmoil and arm themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploding after years of getting drunk under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was only in recent years that many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media as cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians stated that they were gathered to protest.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia in the predominantly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economics, while they exploited the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But that too is changing right now.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are co-ordinating under a screen," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in areas of the Ampera and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairably dominated by members of the ethnic group of the tigray, who account for about 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, until his death in a non-publicized illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly interested in perceiving early signs of discontent and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime is lacking in this basic skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen from relatively obscure reasons in order to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Meles, who came from the tiger region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of security services controlled by the Tigers.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a turmoil in 2005 after thousands were protesting against elections, the government was apparently fed by the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the ensuing raids many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in recent months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and for their measurable progress in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But apparently this has not prevented the intensification of the internal misart of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnic shape.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protesters in Gondar, an amharan city, attacked by Tigray and the hatred for the tigray is more and more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronome flights to neighbouring Somalia, although it recently announced that it closed this base.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim Obama founded ISIS as "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dissipate the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his multiple assertion that President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founder" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not serious.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republicans's presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and intelligible with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his comrades who endeavour to take refuge in protection during an eventful period, to explain to the peculiar position, statements he did not mean at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">Having made the announcement at a campaign event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump complained about the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning weet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was contrary to the previous day Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation seriously.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate didn't want to know about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism collides with Mr. Trump while he has tried to direct the focus of his campaign due to falling survey values on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">On Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he raised strong criticism when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but he later said, "Of course, I thought the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back down as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive, and then" clarify "depending on how the reaction fails." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has assumed an even more etched tone, as his survey values have gone further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist published on Friday showed a leading lead in North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump has generally tried to excuse himself for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he increasingly focuses his attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze has brought his loyal co-workers into the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provocatively his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent advocates, was trying hard to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments" "" "said Mr. Giuliani for the correctness of Mr. Trumps statement about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had set up the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called her backbiters, completely wrong and so it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the mainstream republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as the foreign minister, allowed ISIS to spread herself by taking control of the situation in the Middle East aggressively.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of moving around on each of his words and being biased against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he ridiculed the" "" "poor, miserable" "" "television experts trying to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a foamed café in Williamsburg, in which one could pay only cash, which had no Wi-Fi but served for 15 years of good coffee.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices came out of his Bedford Avenue store front.</seg>
<seg id="4">Soap Cherie's business, which relocated in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Local people smoked it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, except the Chelsea Hotel and Verb is now a soap business."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is a change, then it is also new invention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old coffee shop, the owner and managing director of the new cafe.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working in Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered him to provide funds for a new branch office, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for bagels purchased the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">There are sandwiches with bacon and cheese on the menu and there are garnishes such as capers and acidic onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural rice dishes.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café serves no beer, but there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"many old customers have also been squeezed out of Williamsburg for prizes," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">On a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland's hay usually only comes to the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">After an investigation, this shark was allowed to return to the sea aboard the Sanna research ship.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönlandhay only get up with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely the Greenland-shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it is on average just 1.220 meters far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it arrives, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle embossed by slowness seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal" Science "" "" at any rate from a Greenland hai who could be 392 years old. "" "</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "madness," "" "says Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, this life-span, which means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist suspected that Greenland's hair will become a stone age long ago.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was lacking.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's sharks are hard to observe, finally they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in winter on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland's hair.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow motion measured them, when they left six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Maybe they hunt sleepy animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice-sea and look for cadaver that tortured from higher water-layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues investigated 28 Grönlandhaie, which caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Spitzbergen as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the biggest 502 centimetre measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the carbon-14 method the lenticular of the sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is formed already before the birth of the sharks, the proteins in it are not renewed later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks were remarkably much carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Therefore, their birth was supposed to lie in the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons trials dragged large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the other hand, with 220 centimetres in length, the lentist, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests, which is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday during its investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the other hand, all larger Greenland-sharks had normal carbon-14 amounts in their linsenic nucleus, which results from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493-centimeter-long Greenland-shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimeters might even be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Grönlandhai-females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was well-known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers of the length could assign an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably at the threshold of the sexually mature stage and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland's hay with the increase obviously become at least one and a half centuries time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is not by chance that such methusalemes live mainly in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose bacon at the neck was a 120 year old harpoon pointed, was caught off Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on asparagus flame.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and grow slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often very big.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The loss of heat from one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than that of a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as early as possible," "" "explains the evolutionbiologist Scheuerlein." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">The altar boys from the sea-care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Four stages were dealt with together.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time until the next Romanesque pilgrimage of all the minions in the course of two years, the Federal Council of Ministers of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a several-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations have been examined and finally decided for the Episcopal City of Freiburg, where, this year, during the Holy Year of Mercy with the opened portal of mercy at the Freiburg cathedral, a special pilgrimage destination was offered.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis of Bittelbronn, and the sepulchre, and Haigerloch, and the holy rooms, went their way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before, Father Storost sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrimage crosses and distributed pilgrimages.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb it was driven by train to the starting point of Villingen, where also a Muenster University of Our Lady stands and thus the Pilgrimage was started by the Minster.</seg>
<seg id="9">The single day tours were framed in the morning and evening, depending on a brief impulse with different prayers, songs and texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the Minis made a rest at field crossings, chapels or churches to sing together a song from a specially assembled pilgrim song booklet.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the nights the parish halls of the local parishes were at their disposal.</seg>
<seg id="12">Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller cared for a tasty and starchy dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">We continued on the second day via Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">On top of that, one stepped up the stage to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting stretch of road, but at first some 500 meters of altitude had to be descended from high heat and then climbed again.</seg>
<seg id="15">The earned reward was a common barbecue at the Badweiher in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter we went to the final stage to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">Visibly facilitated and happy the Minis arrived at the Freiburg Minster in the later afternoon and walked through the portal of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a small impulse God was thanked.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Minis by Kooperator Markus Obert arrived at the evening mass in Münster.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day there was still time for the Breisdal metropolis.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon we went by train back to Horb.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the end, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner last night in the men's team sprint in the Velodrom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor roll, who had made his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy to Eigen. the jigsaw made the legend proud when he stormed home to win a victory from the favourites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after taking a modest sixth place during the World Championships in London in March, despite the appearance of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did so in time as a hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired created a gap that kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Scots unfolding now.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy - and Skinner set up an Olympic board in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">After his lap, behind him, Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a big part of the transformation in which Hindes drove in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy saw from his position as BBC expert and dropped Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they climbed to the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it's a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an Olympic board in the final round and defeated the world champions.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph of 2012 alongside Kenny's and Hoys, Hinder admitted that after a weak start he dropped off on the railroad.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no opposition from England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">This time there was no such problem with such an outstanding victory.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Hindi said:" "" "it feels like London with all the UK flags like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form Kenny, it is in the realm of possibility that he repeats Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a contest.</seg>
<seg id="29">This would be for Kenny - who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for British sport; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same as Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint that starts today and will go for more than three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old Bolton said:" "" "I just enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "he said," "" "If he wins two other gold medals, he should be struck to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the finish in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will be held on the second day of the competition, with which Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday he was arguing with representatives before the qualification when officials called him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued and ended tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on his strong train wheel team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a crowd of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the background, drama turned out to be the resignation of Shane Sutton's technical director Shane Sutton in April, in the midst of sex and bulbbing allegations, as well as retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one sees the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks quite like that the legendary reputation GBs, who reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces by workers - are at stake, as the plant operator announces the energy supply contract and thereby elevates all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company announced.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies for the operation of the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years runs in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa facility in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk when closing.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could lead to domino effects as the melt-melting consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Victoria.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa fired the Point Henry melt, which last year led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting company with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp are holding smaller shares.</seg>

<seg id="14">"" "AGL continued to say that the contracts are so-called" "" "hedging transactions" "" "that should have come into force from November 2016." ""</seg>

<seg id="16">"" "" "" "therefore, AGL assumes that contracts will contribute to revenues in the financial year 17," "" "said the supplier." ""</seg>

<seg id="18">"" "AGL announced that it has already transcribed the value of the contracts in the amount of $187 million in" "" "expecting a termination" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Alcoa said that the decision to contract the contracts, the "Alcoas ability... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt" does not interfere.</seg>
<seg id="20">The U.S. company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang who would have come into force from November this year even if it is still debated why it has resigned from the contract.</seg>

<seg id="2">San Antonio Jenner, 20, Model and the fourth daughter of the Managerin and mother of the Cardashian-Jenner clan, Kris is on the cover of the coveted September edition of the US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Antonio, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran at Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, on Thursday announced the news on her Instagram account.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to tears," "" "Kendall wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The cover of Covers was followed by a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians' similar?), seen reality video showing the entire Kardashian Jenner family (except for the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular show biz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as they finish the cover of their sister and that ended with a classical twist: they all have a surprise party planned.</seg>
<seg id="6">This represents the clichéd action of almost every birthday party of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8am), but Kris did not have to let her other girls take part in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, surely a new era of cardashians has begun.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kenda's big sister Kim may have beaten her, concerning the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to see it in April 2014), but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most sold issue of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that rather resembles a photographic book than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (According to Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the waltz 615 pages advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The revelation of his cover stars is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the journal were still seeping before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "in recent years there have been more" "" "celebrities" "" "than" "" "Models that celebrities are" "" "on the cover." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar prize winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honour.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the former category, it is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to celebrities or reality stars or teens of today who know how to turn a good snapshot video (even if it's all true to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are truly talented women who sign up in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, which appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, Jenny's success doesn't like everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With its reality TV history, Jenners's position in the fashion world was always something tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June, the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her "the mistletoe of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings cooked up again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But there seems to be a point where it seems to pass.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">She runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">She makes advertising for your primer of Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">You and all your sisters will sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Paywall Apps.</seg>

<seg id="5">And that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities, we will have 10,000 new apprentices alone, who create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="7">As they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of the expansion of Heathrow is too great.</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blamed on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The two-flyers had wronged in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers any question asked.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">Expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in economic growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and to the whole of the UK.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have a great team in Heathrow, which has converted a £11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from T5 - five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, up to T2 which was built in the middle of the two most frequented catwalks of the world.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">The London matches of 2012 were a great success for the UK and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="1">NASA climate model: Venus was once inhabitable</seg>
<seg id="2">According to projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was likely to be habitable once.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies NASA developed a model to discover the past of the Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have been retracted with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere once ground-like conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, erdlike atmosphere and slowly turned on.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably showed more dry areas than earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to house life and protected from fast evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matt.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of the Venus increases its day-side of the sun almost two months long," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the sun's heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures, which are some degrees cooler than that of the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of the Venus that resembles the evolution that previously was suspected of planet researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably habitable, Venus -- during the course of several billion years --was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Her oceans digested and her water vapor was burned away by the ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their Hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere remained at carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect - Venus, as we know it today.</seg>

<seg id="3">The new data help the astronomers understand why stars rotate in the cluster of stars to different rates, as well as in what context the rotation-periods with the planet formation are.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other constellations, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>

<seg id="6">Many stars in this cluster of stars, which originated some 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak rotational rates these mature stars expel large amounts of star winds.</seg>
<seg id="9">As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">If a star age, its rotation rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognising the time between the appearance of a visible star spot -- like sunspots.</seg>

<seg id="2">Caught: because of a positive doping test, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland must not start in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping events.</seg>
<seg id="4">A wiped athlete would have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh competition day, the first official doping events became known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese float in Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre obstacle-runner Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and excluded in Brazil - just before the start of the already critical athletics competitions these messages come to an end.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen last Sunday the diuretic Hydrochlorothiazide was detected, which is used as a massive drug for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday afternoon, the CAS International Sports Court confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old took fourth place in the final over 100 m of butterfly, only 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen should have participated in the courses over 50 m Freestyle.</seg>

<seg id="12">"" "the national association takes the matter" "" "very serious and requires full cooperation in the investigations," "" "said Xinhua from a message:" "" "we will work with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the judgment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also in the night of Rio the news came about the positive rehearsal at Danekova, the 33-year-old went on the offensive himself.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "this was an incredible shock," "" "she said to the Bulgarian TV channel BNT." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "she was innocent," "" "the only explanation could be nutritional supplements" "", "the athlete announced." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, the banned substance should be the blood doping agent EPO.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekova was provisionally suspended, according to the BNT, the B-sample should also be positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov promptly communicated with criticism of the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I don't understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions," he said: "we are Bulgarians under observation, so many have already been excluded."</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, all weightlifters from the chronic doping-polluted nation are not allowed to take part in Rio.</seg>

<seg id="24">Before the athletes start, the Danapowa case is a further heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The IAAF World Union had prohibited the entire Russian team up to an exception due to systematic doping, but also the Kenya nation produced numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, in the swimming sport, the previous offences in China also caused violent clashes between the athletes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data theft: so perfide blackmail hackers their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of express malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey of the malware defense specialists Malwarebytes of 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the last twelve months were at least once, in part multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom required by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators specialise in attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially blackout ransom will be significantly higher than for private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently watching a startling speedy evolution of the malware," "" "explained Malwarebytes leader Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "World." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most MalwareProgrammes were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the offenders discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the change to company attaches occurred rapidly in the past months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works after a simple pattern: once active on a victim's computer, it searches for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as to archive images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and erase the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the receivables of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the end turn code to the files, the victims have to transfer money - usually in the form of cryptocurrencies Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users find the personal photo database at stake, companies deal with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage comes off when a ransomware hits.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the German companies affected reported loss of turnover by Ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt business operations, in one case people were in danger of living.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims: don't pay, you only support the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers, it is difficult to reject the perpetrator's demand in view of a downtime in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers, in turn, know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the safety researchers from F-Secure have investigated the user interfaces and contact with blackmail users and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims via chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, set free accessible support websites or decrypt sample files for free.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private people are redeemed for payments of just a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate tough and pay five-digit amounts in order to get their data back unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the ransomware blackmail, the hackers become more and more professional and share the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski of the anti-virus provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware roughly within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that it is about three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software building block to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The existing malware kit came into being by purchasing the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and $10,000.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," Wisniewski says.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmailers then seek out more hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the forums on the ground, buys the set of a criminal and asks another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is per certified computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually the criminals then use spammers with dissemination," "" "said Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now well-known for many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of the companies IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust that Ransomware can repel Ransomware by means of file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful measurement, the perpetrators are threatening to release sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," "" "says Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">As a result, the potential damage potential is much higher, depending on the type of data.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the future, the perpetrators may have completely new targets on the Internet of things on the grain.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Defcon hacker conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of the heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="4">Sounds fairly overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V seems rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear, it does not work closely at any place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect, only the cockpit-top falls down there.</seg>

<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds like: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a chin-up and thus offer storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The luggage compartment can be loaded well, but the charging height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he should do his job a bit more quietly.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.</seg>

<seg id="21">The remote light assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent drive controller responds to the traffic sign recognition and throttles the speed if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="23">But the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, App integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and one HDMI socket are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The roughly 29,000 Euro for the well-equipped top diesel is fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who don't want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips for sleeping disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening you roll around eternally, you lie awake for hours, in the morning it is already far before the alarm-ring no more to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not restful.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleep disorders express themselves?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and many causes can be underestimated, emphasised Hans-Günter Grisons, member of the Executive Board of the German Society for Sleep and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What we understand for the time being, however, is the insomnia, thus an inhalation and sleep disturbance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Especially the diarrhoea of many people feel unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board at the German GP Association with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently the sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early wake-up is common in case of depression," "" "says Weber." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that various factors condition each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, those who have a herniated failure can lie badly, wake up every two to three hours and may start to ponder about everyday problems and worries, strikes an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I go to the doctor with sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor, inform the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is slightly irritable, has mood swings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to relieve sleep disorders, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medicines - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">There is hardly any resident sleeping medicine in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Sleep Medicine Center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">For this reason, in case of sleeping problems, one should first turn to the family doctor, advises Weber.</seg>
<seg id="24">It can be clarified if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep lab, and what will happen?</seg>
<seg id="26">For the examination in the sleep laboratory, doctors advise, for example, in snoring with breathing replacements, in case of illness of the day, in sleeping transformers or if one does not find the cause of a breakdown disorder, explains Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "just do not make a nap," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">The former German swimmers Markus Deibler has expressed himself as a disappointing result of the disappointing cutting of the DSV team at Olympis.</seg>
<seg id="3">In December 2014, he first met gold at the Doha short-track world championships and at the same time exhibited his first world record.</seg>
<seg id="4">The former DSV-athlete Markus Deibler has now protected himself against his ex-teammates in his criticism.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 €bonus and a Dschungelkönig of 150.000 €, nobody should wonder about missing medals," "" "wrote the 26-year-old on his Facebook page last night." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The conveying system in the swimming sport is bad, the doping controls are very good.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not see or even operate doping." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "I don't say that the controls should be set here," "" "he added." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).</seg>
<seg id="10">That is exactly how it should be held with countries.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few lime trees, still a rest cobblestones: the Riga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not seem so at first sight, but the police count them among the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If one goes along the road from east to west, one passes through playgrounds, a fresher kindergarten and a biolade.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "someone" "" "ugly!" "" "sprayed on the façade of a grey house." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Compared to a Lidl, which is to be demolished too soon, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments is to be built here by 2017.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "articles about this" "" "trendy district" "", "as indicated by the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain, are however preferred over the past few weeks with burning cars." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have leases, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Especially the Berlin interior senator Henkel has repeatedly expressed itself for a hard action by the police against the project, the area referred to as "no-go-zone" for policemen and 94 as a point of departure of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After the police cleared the rooms on the ground floor, the cadre-smiths, with 300 police officers, the police patrol three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew-cars on site, blocked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, the building workers were renovating the rooms on behalf of the unknown owner of the house.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers migrated under the cheering of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon, the road seems peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others chat before späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in the neighbourhood since 1999, and Jana *, who is moving three children here, are especially annoyed by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez, who mostly wanted police protection from the vandalient left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, the Berlin interior senator and the police between landowners and their neighbours, obviously does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers "district, which today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and has a high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Straße in the vicinity of the Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was evacuated under a lot of police orders in a regular battle, many of the projects in Riga were legalized and still today still inhabited by the people who occupied it 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district has become increasingly magnet for tourists and elective people from all over the world over the past few years: with them residents from GDR times and former house occupiers are now sharing their neighbourhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also reflected in the rents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: they recognize them against fan-blown windows or newly painted facades, which were thrown with paint-bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other street was mentioned this year along with the words" "" "left-autonomous violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason why not all neighbours consider this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by criminality: crimes like body injury are almost exclusively directed against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the crimes are caused by damage, which tends to meet the newbuildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rented house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for acts of violence, it is appeasing: the people in the 94 are their neighbours who are certainly not.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars no longer give it to the Rigaer anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "here you help each other, live together on the street and get more of each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is consciously drawn into the Riga road - and remains.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was so important that the local residents got back their streets: from the police, politicians and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: by faceless newbuildings in former mosquitoes that displace the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are freehold flats that are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well-charged are living here," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I can absolutely not approve violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should you do if you never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for the extended ones who are annoyed by color bombings: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the neighbourhood.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who come here should be aware of this - just like someone who moves to a pub district, can complain badly about noise there.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons presented only with first names have asked not to be called by their proper name.</seg>

<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the Refugee Officer for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of the administration around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working group refugee aid, administration, authorities and anyone else involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer from the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is here, the affectionate wool milchsau, which has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">In this way, some - less laughing but rather focused on the multitude of tasks desired - meant that the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">Looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, an affectionate lust for pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administration is not her central area, Annika Deuschle means.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organization, work with local people and behind the scenes as well as networking activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has limited a 50 percent job for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine Client, that Annika Deuschle supports hone- and full-time actors." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers will soon be available in the Wasenstrasse</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection provision.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or hired residential premises.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the district office to the municipality and Jobcenters.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">Up to now, it does not work, so be dependent on private dwellings, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common homes need to be intimidated, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">New containers will soon be installed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But it is not only with apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed stay there are internships, apprenticeships, school grounds, one-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine client.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house masters, do non-profit work - and that motivates and very tidy according to Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So there is also administration and volunteers here.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "they must explain to the refugees that it simply takes and they can bridge the time wisely, for example with language courses." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever develops the feeling at some point, he can't help in Urbach, do not work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">But there are problems too, the customer honestly says, "People who don't do anything at all." the work of Deuschle and the customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two after the latest incidents fear radicalisation, even in a small community such as Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "Regine client says quite clearly," "" "what some naive may call." "" "a residual risk could and would not exclude them." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also the subject of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins will completely reinvent them.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "says Regine Client." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">Thus, the main and the volunteers have to look out for activities in the region and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They are always in the background that a new blow to refugees and migrants will soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a ceiling?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly is afraid of politics.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to put them on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "we have not arrived in Urbach where we want to go," "" "says Annika Deuschle." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the original authors are already busy integrating the existing people into a sensible way.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
