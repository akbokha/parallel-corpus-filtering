Obama receiving Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
they both wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s destabili@@ zing action in the Middle East .
however , the meeting should also address the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution being discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s continuing settlement construction and th@@ rows Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
through the deal promoted by Obama on Iran &apos;s nuclear programme , the relationship between the two has deteri@@ or@@ ated further .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu , at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans in front of the US Congress , held a controversial speech , which was part of an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting was rejected with reference to the upcoming election in Israel .
in an emergency call , Professor told me to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb announced with a slightly z@@ itt@@ led voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house .
Lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; cute dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the cell phone .
inside the house the officers found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ en@@ ss and a hand@@ written note scri@@ b@@ bled on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to und@@ o it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds where he shot and killed a popular professor of history , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University police chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb had made the fatal distress call some@@ time after that .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took life when the police ch@@ ained him .
one day after the shooting at the university , which forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb is motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were happy about his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ en@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or criminal background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , comprising 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time there were some tendencies towards problematic behavior .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that Lamb had told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in employment policy of the University meant that the doctorate for which Lamb had worked so hard would not be a guarantee for an automatic path to employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer .
after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs , when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested Lamb self @-@ contained a .@@ 38 cali@@ bre pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile to the south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 Lamb started his work at the University , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he completed his doctorate in education in spring .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and he was 20 when they met through friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar playing .
he was the s@@ warm of women at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls were mel@@ ted when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ air@@ ston said , now 40 and live in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ en@@ ss were obviously together for some time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no evidence of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ Ã©@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ en@@ ss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail joined together on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ en@@ ss was a nurse working online for various companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertaining co @-@ ordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poorly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he saw Lamb and Pr@@ en@@ ss Night in the night 5 September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica play before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no indication that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were in the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , &quot; said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his bro@@ therhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening , about 900 people attended the Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght commemor@@ ative ceremony .
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the watch during the &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot;
classes are resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Rog@@ eli@@ o Soli@@ s reported Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associ@@ ated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to reflect that Lamb is now saying that Lamb made the emergency call after he killed Schmidt , and that Lamb in his emergency call was Pr@@ en@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
Toys R Us plans to hire less man@@ power for the Christmas season
Toys R Us says it won &apos;t be so many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby product dealer says he will give the employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in shops and distribution centres throughout the country . 45@@ ,000 workers were employed in the 2014 Christmas season .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees is increasing from October to December .
while the holidays are still months away , the Christmas business is approaching , and companies are preparing to hire time workers to equip shops with employees that sell , ship and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the Ro@@ y@@ als , and I realize that the seat next to me is empty , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to my mind that I am a simul@@ ated y@@ awn and a mes@@ ial length away from being with the princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest time travel film ever filmed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back in Time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected movie the@@ aters in October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN chief again calls on all parties , including UN Security Council , to unite and to support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution .
B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Britain and France - on the br@@ ink of minist@@ erial meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ an urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in fighting the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in at@@ taining a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 Survey data showing that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republi@@ cans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks during surveys down , it has ( yet ) not working .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some are beginning to seriously wonder what it means for the odds of nom@@ ination of real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that at this time , in 2011 , Rick Per@@ rin &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of whom only gained a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have fought in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative Economic Group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ um@@ ps staying power and start letting their dollars run to overthrow it .
here are some recent survey values that indicate that the real estate Mog@@ ul is not only a temporary phase :
tr@@ um@@ ps Pop@@ ular values have turned 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two out of ten Republi@@ cans saw the estate Mog@@ ul positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these numbers are in the early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C pol@@ l last week , 67 percent of the Republi@@ cans said they were either &quot; thri@@ lled &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two out of 10 say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upset &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son manages roughly the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they are &quot; thri@@ lled &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say they are &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the re@@ public@@ ans do not see Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for its bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of Irish voters who are among the Republi@@ cans believe that real estate Mog@@ ul has the right tem@@ per for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the first pre @-@ election state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ cans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
yet 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively execute his office , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament does not fit into the White House so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters accustomed itself to the idea .
when they set up their schol@@ arly hats , Republi@@ can voters think of Tr@@ ump for real .
if you are asked who is most likely to win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination say after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from last week , four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change from the time when four out of ten at the end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this time in the final cycle , four out of ten Republi@@ cans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination versus just 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a large number of GO@@ P voters see Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Republi@@ cans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is still beating almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to tr@@ um@@ ps leadership , while anti @-@ dump@@ ing support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump has harvested the majority support .
he has ahead of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate that strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a short majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their mind .
a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have issued their votes .
of course a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say that they never change opinion .
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
nonetheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competi@@ tor at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their mind are twice as common for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his election campaign two months ago , immigration was a pi@@ vot@@ al point in public discourse on 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump will remove decisive His@@ pan@@ o Americans from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the re@@ orientation endeav@@ ors .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ Survey of Monday , six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say they agree with Tr@@ ump in questions of immigration .
so long as the immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to also do it .
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s to new maximum levels .
Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son now account for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , mainly because of their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say in the new Mon@@ days @-@ survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than anyone with government experience .
and they are fur@@ ious at Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago , shows that three out of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hel@@ lish . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential districts in Germany
here you find the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea area .
in the street , a square meter of a housing house costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which particular positions one square meter costs the most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential districts , however , the price is like pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; VÃ¶l@@ ker has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euros per square meter , well @-@ marked .
but it &apos;s good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here as an exception .
champi@@ ons League : a dream start thanks to MÃ¼ller and GÃ¶tz@@ e
two scor@@ er in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas MÃ¼ller has just one run .
a lucky hit by Thomas MÃ¼ller gave the FC Bayern the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
the world champi@@ ons Thomas MÃ¼ller and Mario GÃ¶tz@@ e have launched a dream start in the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; by FC Bayern in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ ra@@ eus .
the team of coach P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola gained their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to MÃ¼ll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and GÃ¶tz@@ hits ( 8@@ 9. ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth star success in series should be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
in his 28th hit in the Champions League for Bavaria led , MÃ¼ller was rewarded with good help from the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who let the world champion pass on as a flan@@ k .
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m had promised before the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based word .
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his most recent home games in the top class , among them famous clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ Ã©@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled .
but the Bavaria , defeated in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went cour@@ age@@ ously with their offensive efforts , but often too mon@@ oton@@ ous to work .
the attacks were often initiated by the shift of a game to the left @-@ hand Douglas Costa , which was rarely en@@ forced against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ abor@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
MÃ¼ller had more luck on the right than his flan@@ k from the right half @-@ field hit the left upper tor@@ so .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion announced the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , when Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ StÃ¼r@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown struck the Pol@@ es &apos; head@@ ball from the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct withdrawal , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto would kne@@ el with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians wound up their usual domin@@ ating game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus was able to set con@@ i@@ fers .
but on door@@ keepers , Manuel Neu@@ er was allowed to leave .
so for example , when he drew a shot of idea about the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before Neu@@ er he let Guardi@@ ola defend a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it well .
Mario GÃ¶tz@@ e , back to muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , sat outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero gave the green light only after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Matthias Sam@@ mer , member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever wants to make something different from it is already vi@@ cious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to the slaugh@@ tered Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) .
GÃ¶tz@@ e arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later , MÃ¼ller continued to set it up .
in front of the game it had come to Kra@@ v@@ alle in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly m@@ um@@ med Bayern fans in their audience souvenir sheet apparently provoked the supporters of host Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with sticks against the Munich fans .
at least one Bayern fan was injured in violation of the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lung , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam &apos;s long @-@ term study .
the good news : in the absence of a ren@@ unciation , the risk falls quickly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers risk losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ Fa@@ che .
the scientists had more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
tooth decay causes cavi@@ ties and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ va , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
smoking is a risk factor for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , emphas@@ ise the authors .
the connection between smoking and tooth loss is therefore reduced to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who quit smoking could reduce their risk within a very short time , write the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take more than ten years until the threat to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers is dec@@ lining , first author Thomas Dietrich , from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must convince people of being non @-@ smo@@ kers , study manager H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking reduces life time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and containers and according to our findings also leads to good dental health up to high age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of tooth@@ lessness has affected DI@@ f@@ E .
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking raises the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study confirms the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists come across c@@ ages from the late Anti@@ quity
for the ump@@ teenth time , archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne .
in the vicinity of the construction site for the new Rhine @-@ bou@@ levard , arch@@ e@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum skel@@ et@@ ons and rem@@ n@@ ants of historical buildings have been excav@@ ated , museum director Marcus Trier said on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , histori@@ ans are looking for so @-@ called soil monuments .
for all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as the Department of Archae@@ ological Monum@@ ents .
in the third section of the Rhine @-@ bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists were now found .
from text documents it has already been known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century had been a church , Trier was explaining .
in addition to rem@@ n@@ ants of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves , which belonged to the church .
young woman caught by freight train
after a young woman arrives at the station in the Gei@@ ste@@ erable Lin@@ ders , the Federal Police is asking the people for help .
on the early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 o &apos;clock the woman crossed the railway station at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from the direction of MÃ¶n@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach .
as a result of the acquisition of the train , she has suffered severe injuries by the federal police .
it was treated as a doctor on site and taken to a hospital by rescue workers .
about the cause of the ni@@ gh@@ tly crossing of the rails of the young woman there are no evidence of the agents that are drow@@ ning .
the incident was probably witnessed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .
residents or p@@ asser@@ s by Lin@@ der@@ ner Bahn , Ziegel@@ bak@@ cker@@ weg , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ straÃe and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther StraÃe ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) come into question .

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TT@@ IP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to improve the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TT@@ IP , the European Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controversial private arbit@@ ration facilities for disputes between the corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its function corresponds to significantly more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Commissioner @-@ design@@ ate Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ strÃ¶m on the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de proposed introducing the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Government announced support .
TT@@ IP aims to create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings cont@@ end specifically that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are to come from the EU , the US and third countries .
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to appeal against judgments .
to date , the parties involved agreed among themselves on arbit@@ rators , and there was no obj@@ ection to their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past months it became clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and fair@@ ness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Malm@@ strÃ¶m . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it wants to work towards an International Investment Court according to its own specifications .
there could be conflicts between Chinese companies and EU states , for example .
the investor state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) arbit@@ ration proceedings , especially demanded by large corporations , are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great opposition in Europe against TT@@ IP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel @-@ justice system , which allows companies to fight for damages tax@@ pay@@ ers , le@@ verage national laws , or en@@ force a reduction of consumer and environmental standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the first comments , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organisations such as Camp@@ act identified the European Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate .
it was critic@@ ised above all to not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German Minister of Economy Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a major step forward .
the Commission took into account essential points in the reform that the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked with other EU Trade Ministers in the spring .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ strÃ¶m &apos;s plans .
the European company B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against limiting the possibilities of action of the economy by too many new rules .
particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged by that .
it remained unclear when the negotiations on the TT@@ IP trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) have been concluded .
the negotiations have been ongoing since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the US so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should already be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is no longer valid .
delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is sitting on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him there is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the intim@@ i@@ dating folk singer recorded the picturesque US state of Mich@@ igan with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost caught by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells us about different places he always records on the map , what his min@@ u@@ ti@@ ously and delic@@ ately arranged songs report .
where they arose and what it looks like , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderfully creative Ir@@ rer .
with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State , &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs seem to be very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties but can always be very opul@@ ent at any time .
the rum@@ our of &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 U.S. states should be ob@@ s@@ essed .
but already in 2004 and in the clos@@ eness to the Rhine , Seven Sw@@ ans have already appeared and have a positive effect on certain expectations .
this reduces St@@ ev@@ ens here .
live guitar and ban@@ jo are enough for him .
a year later the musician living in New York returns to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) a celebrated masterpiece appears in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
borrow@@ ed from ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is not missing in any annual list of influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after very productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic spare parts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth decent studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ ber@@ ation .
long ago the smaller clubs got away , the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five member band .
in the glo@@ omy ham@@ burger More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although almost 2000 guests sit in their chairs now , the notic@@ e@@ ably mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to intim@@ acy and folk .
without a word to the audience , the group plays an excellent musician through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
from the audience one hears : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and one can basically throw away the &quot; record . &quot;
only one en@@ core thank@@ ed St@@ ev@@ ens , plays a few older songs acousti@@ cally , and finally bows down to thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gran@@ ce
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the prime minister &apos;s Fra@@ gran@@ ce is eag@@ erly awa@@ ited
the new Labour leader , Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , is supposed to give his debut at the prime minister &apos;s Fra@@ gran@@ ce and set up for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to provide the first of his six pres@@ et questions shortly after noon , and his performance is likely to be audi@@ ted by the media and the Labour Euro MPs .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary sc@@ rut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile , during the commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent during a commem@@ oration ceremony for the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain is provoked , critic@@ ising a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two news night program that he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they invo@@ ke differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary party originally supported him as a leader .
the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are &quot; st@@ acking &quot; within the Labour Party as well as Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s remarks on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour amendments introduce to remove the whole idea of limiting altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow working and pension minister said that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against government plans to cut the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds to Â£ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron since he has been T@@ ory boss over the last decade of the Dis@@ patch box in parliament .
the Labour leader , who has promised another policy approach , says he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the fra@@ grant of the Prime Minister is too con@@ front and that he will refra@@ in both &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stroke &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the quar@@ rel with re@@ tain@@ ers and has instead committed to focusing on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the Shadow Economic Council , will represent him if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea that other colleagues occasionally took the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the House of Comm@@ ons , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; P@@ unch Beat , &quot; which is often associated with the fra@@ grant of the Prime Minister . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the questionn@@ aires with the Prime Minister were considered the most important bar@@ ometer of the verdict of a leader and his leadership in the House of Comm@@ ons and his position among his parliamentary colleagues , although critics argued that they had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needed far @-@ reaching reforms .

pounds Ear@@ n through Acc@@ eler@@ ated W@@ age Growth in the United Kingdom
the pound increased sharply according to data that indicate an increase in the UK wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ BM@@ iller bid target .
between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the quick@@ est and quick@@ est estim@@ ation over the time of an increase in interest rates since 2009 .
the pound increased by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to â¬ 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking eover offer of rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring together brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry Shar@@ es were up 0.@@ 9 % higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures suggest all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - announces growth again .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core grew 5 % after the mining industry said that it had taken $ 2.5 billion by stock sales as part of its debt reduction strategy .
the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decrease of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his estim@@ ation for the company rating to &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % after the sports clothing company reported a pre @-@ tax profit of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages thre@@ aten expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs for its company , &quot; he says .
the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .
Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber in the Capital : on Bie@@ ber Expedition in Berlin
Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber , Meg@@ ast@@ ar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 21 years young , a hanging br@@ anding with a sovereign debt crisis &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the type with plat@@ inum bl@@ ond hair is 100 million Euros hard .
rather even more .
at present , Mon@@ si@@ eur Bie@@ ber is in Berlin .
and the generation U@@ 17 turns through .
like Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Jus@@ tin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , however , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates of the Berliner lux@@ hotel at Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .
the Bie@@ ber Construction : here you live I@@ dol , whose posters hang on in Sz@@ cz@@ ec@@ in since Monday evening .
the suite in which the Canadian singer lives , costs the day exactly as much as their Mama E@@ wa deserves in half a year .
if at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually my Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a should sit in the tenth class in the gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fulfill her a dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
school attendance certificate ?
who is it@@ ching ?
the fans do not .
nor does Bie@@ ber do its own .
that took care anyway .
for advertising in the advertising break of the super@@ fashion , he cas@@ c@@ aded three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ple company split many , many dollars to the Bie@@ ber account .
and at every doll which looks like it and goes over the counter , Bie@@ ber also collects .
when Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee , you are amazed at the window pane .
he is said to have exploited more than 100 million .
some say that hyp@@ e g@@ gling too far .
others stress that Bie@@ ber is finally in the US and UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; at No. 1 .
Bie@@ ber herself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , are not interested in the many zer@@ os .
at least he does so .
PE@@ GI@@ DA Poster Set Leban@@ ese to the idea of a Pot@@ ato twe@@ eter
potatoes or twe@@ eter ?
it is both - and indeed in the Pot@@ ato twe@@ eter , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger ic owner Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y developed .
inspired by the phrase &quot; Pot@@ ato@@ e instead of D@@ Ã¶ner , &quot; Al@@ ha@@ y potatoes and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer .
the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ Ã¶ner , &quot; which he had seen by chance on television .
since then , a barbecue sk@@ ewer , which is equipped with meat and potatoes , rot@@ ates in its store .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is multic@@ ultural for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea was to bring the Leban@@ ese into the patent office in Munich .
it has recently been protected as a utility model according to the authority .
Al@@ ha@@ y does not want to betra@@ y how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer has .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he thinks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the culinary international understanding also goes well with its customers .
met@@ withdraw La@@ un@@ ches So@@ il Sustainability Camp@@ aig@@ n to Com@@ bat Al@@ location
Met@@ z tries to protect the I@@ GA branch offices in front of an Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a ground@@ breaking campaign to defend the market share of I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ ers and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from Dun@@ s@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and store shop@@ keepers who sell cheap tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ ers will be releasing further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler of food , alcohol and equipment goes through its annual investor strategy day .
there is much in the game as South Australia and Western Australia make up nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins than the Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in the eastern states .
however analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will cut around five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after opening its first markets and will take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and met@@ a 250 million dollars by the end of 2016 .
this pro@@ g@@ nosis is based on the assumption that in the next year Al@@ di will establish 25 branch offices in SA and 30 in WA , generating a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in the food and food business and in the amounts on Met@@ a &apos;s high fixed cost base could cost around 13 million dollars in earnings before interest and taxes , &quot; said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , Met@@ a loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan showed that I@@ GA purch@@ as@@ ers are the most faithful .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ a &apos;s revenue in the food and food business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent by 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leader of the fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told in a business lunch in Melbourne that metal cash will likely disappear within a decade .
Met@@ ers refused to comment publicly on Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the Management Board made contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 , i@@ gas market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenue from Met@@ a Food and Food Tra@@ ffi@@ cking , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , which reflects the operating debt reduction at equal printing on sales and margins .
the wholes@@ aler , however , resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to compare sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths with hundreds of products each week and to improve I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores thanks to faster @-@ growing fresh foods and delivering a better selection of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s CEO Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging adjustments to El@@ an will grow and hope that the wholes@@ aler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017 .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ z and deserves praise for his own behaviour according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; was r@@ amp@@ aged by the not@@ orious struggles of Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ry@@ an Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , where Har@@ rison cried out : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have had to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ z , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how to beat a tennis ra@@ cket after a cr@@ amp@@ f sh@@ ook up a potential US Open Vic@@ tory by Richard Gas@@ quet , He@@ aly Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m accompli@@ shing is the fact that after my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost the US Open because of a fight , but he is not the first player to break a bat out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well respected in changing area , he is good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not consider Kyr@@ gy@@ z when deciding on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term fixed part to the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all the controversy surrounding &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Nick made the ascent very quickly , which people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he &apos;s climbing in the eyes of the public and he deserves all the criticism that he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions . some time out of the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght in which he can only think about it , I consider appropriate , and it is best for the team and it is the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary explains the emergency situation and negotiated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all that tried to enter the country illeg@@ ally . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border , when hundreds of migrants drow@@ ned in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Serbian officials re@@ acted with indignation .
the people who fled from violence set out for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled down there .
but frustr@@ ations got up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter flo@@ ats over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and exc@@ laimed insul@@ ts against the Hungarian Emergency Police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some returned from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated that it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back while more and more are coming from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ year @-@ old blo@@ c at a meeting in Brussels which could not make a common immigration policy .
the ministers agreed , however , to share the responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in the over@@ run Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be made that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit in the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the migration crisis of the continent .
Hungary , however , did not put his hopes on a spe@@ edy action of Brussels or its neighbors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency exit called on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to tackle the crisis so that they could ban roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister , Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to , said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country after having completed a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison mates were deployed during the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and entry point to the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insist@@ ed that most arriving economic refugees are looking for a better life and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly contrary to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or damaging the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence that the government built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also specify higher prison sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares emergency status , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it is very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the deployment of the military that is expected next week , but repor@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , Country Security Ad@@ visor for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting crimes according to the new laws .
authorities are trying to fix the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon arrived with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and squee@@ ze a crowd to get there .
about 20 people were able to enter , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l hal@@ ved
former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face to ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the pre @-@ election ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidates for the Pres@@ idency , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the pres@@ election .
more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined by which candidates they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders achieved some profits .
Clinton has a big advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these le@@ aps have dimin@@ ished .
their support for the men has sun@@ k considerably , and S@@ anders res@@ ides here only with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage for democratic voters under 50 years has van@@ ished , and they and s@@ anders are now at the same level .
Clinton , however , still has a big advantage over the older voters .
last month Clinton had a double @-@ digit lead in the Liber@@ als ahead of S@@ anders , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries nationwide say that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps it &apos;s not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are thri@@ lled above all by her .
the views are more strongly mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about a quarter they would enthusias@@ tically support them .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their peak candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
when Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman president becomes ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
permission to deal with the problems and the ability to choose will also be cited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as vice @-@ president raises potential for the Pres@@ idency of the Guard , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if democratic voters are asked for the elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head .
from Clinton &apos;s followers , more than half said that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to run for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead is increased , from 20 points with bi@@ des in race to 30 points without him in the race .
over fifty percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure has dropped from 78 percent last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage he sees as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most eligible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the eligi@@ bility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar to last month , not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these sel@@ ections emerged as unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important features for voters in the pres@@ election of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
for the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best cut off with hon@@ esty , whereas Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of him .
democratic voters in the prim@@ aries generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ideological in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters do not have the opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server remain as foreign minister during the term of office , most of the demo@@ cra@@ cies of the prim@@ aries are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it did not affect their opinions altogether .
but it is another story in the American public in general .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the email controversy had no effect on Clinton &apos;s general opinions , although 36 percent said that their opinion had deteri@@ or@@ ated .
they are mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six out of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse .
although Clinton is considered to be honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of the voting rights do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 per cent of the voters entitled to vote do not consider Tr@@ ump as non @-@ honest and non @-@ trust@@ worthy .
however , Clinton and Tr@@ ump have received good marks for guidance .
of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush would best cut off with hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders to be honest , but as with Car@@ son many do not have any opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 demo@@ cra@@ cies in the pres@@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves closer to Donald Tr@@ ump on a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tr@@ ump
the two candidates now account for half of the voters &apos; support in the new survey , and others lose a lot of support .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers . support grows from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , 27 % in the Tuesday survey .
but Car@@ son shot at the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and out@@ performs Tr@@ ump in Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell to the deepest , and 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are 6 % in third place .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people from Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C pol@@ l published last week shows that Car@@ son climb@@ s to the poll@@ s - with 19 % support from the Republi@@ cans , behind the ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post showed also Tr@@ ump significantly ahead of Car@@ son .
looking at a Car@@ son ascending in the last week , Tr@@ ump finds some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the Eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers already have a trip to the Mediterranean to find even warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go to the sea : the water in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares .
bathing temperatures , on the other hand , continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic , it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College new@@ bie
almost two years after a student died during a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , mur@@ ders were filed against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ bro@@ therhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduction ceremony in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , shared the police .
officials said he had been loaded with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and was attacked repeatedly while trying to move over a frozen field to a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ bro@@ therhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , goo@@ gle his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to get advice , police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide the utensils and set the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood in principle about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said polic@@ eman Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeated with bl@@ unt force injuries to the head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; too many families have been destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ anes of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies since 1970 every year at the ch@@ ic@@ anes , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation .
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended Mor@@ ning &apos;s third grade for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of bul@@ ky attacks and the formation of a criminal organisation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the people involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also be accoun@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College had banned the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood has rev@@ oked their affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
an increase in interest is coming , and the hous@@ ebo@@ xes are stag@@ gering , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slip into recession .
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance for the process .
a recession came in only 11 months after the first increase in interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , al@@ beit not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so heavily that investors should not focus when it starts to increase interest rates , but rather on the period required for normal@@ isation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could find that all the excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated because of an increase in interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no impact .
here is a view based on historical trends , how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen in the last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rate increases may make things volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment enters , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets yields 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may reflect the delay in monetary policy again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a more recent study on what happened after the F@@ ed &apos;s interest rate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market in the past 35 years is mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rise , rather flat in the past six cycles after 500 days , with an average yield in the past six cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis , which Bob D@@ oll , chief plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , published at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the growth cycle and the return on returns begins to decrease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic activity , but interest increases often promote it .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that it did not exist before and which could ha@@ sten a recession .
it is particularly not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 increases in interest since 1950 were only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect that this will continue and anticipate only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed figures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If it &apos;s different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Deutsche Bank said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants concentrated all year on an increase in net interest rates , and all the eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading only gives a 25 percent chance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all the excav@@ ation cycles from 1950 to the present day have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ sh@@ Ã¶h@@ en set in the shadows very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far .
fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates a rise in interest , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that bonds are quicker than when they change their strategic course .
in bonds the returns seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / decrease takes place in the cycle .
at the end of the growth cycle , the directors immediately drop , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the increase in interest rates will cause yields between longer and shorter bonds closer together and result in a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is interesting that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ Strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest has increased , the yield curve is flat , lending is extended and volati@@ lity has increased - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy .
in large and whole , companies that handle the greater part of their business in the United States will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts are getting worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and the financing of their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest increase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet achieved an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high @-@ capital returns as well as low volati@@ lity for their shares exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts become a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will most lose , Gold@@ man said .
outside the pure share games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers could see profits through higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are how fast this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Members of Parliament Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the station for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; du@@ mm@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ish@@ able from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also referred to BBC Music Awards and said they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked the broadcast The Voice and said this was not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns &quot; to Classic FM , maintains a leading member of Parliament and raises new pressure on the broad@@ ca@@ ster to prove that he does something that the private sen@@ ders do not do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives of Andrew B@@ ingham also said to the BBC Bos@@ sen that the public broad@@ ca@@ ster &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the word - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which began last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be The Br@@ its just under a different name .
so if you &apos;re trying to do something different - these are two spontaneously named examples where you are actually im@@ it@@ ating what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC Director General rejected the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I &apos;m learning about Radio 3 , I &apos;m not going to learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really un@@ sur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to commission new works is really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey ar@@ gues that harder work has to be done to engage audiences as it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of the BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sports for the commercial ri@@ vals .
the band &apos;s T@@ ory MEP , Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins , attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of Â£ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insist@@ ed that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in a special BBC manner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wants the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when the next time there is a series of entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from further series of The Voice in the future or to issue money from the fee pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales were slow@@ ing down in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
the last month has been the lowest score ever since the record was recorded in the year 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed down the issue in November
for over a decade , virtual shopping has bo@@ omed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost towns .
but experts say there are now signs that online sales are stagn@@ ating after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , this has always progres@@ sed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the Guardian &apos;s IM@@ R@@ G sales index . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now it comm@@ utes itself , and we may experience that growth is decreasing .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for the decreasing turnover .
experts believe that buyers will return their purchases to this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer sites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , on which the purch@@ as@@ ers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent purch@@ as@@ ers from buying purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that of Â£ 5 spending a little more than 1 Â£ online was spent online .
for some products such as TVs and washing machines , more than a third of purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than one quarter of people bu@@ ys clothing and shoes online instead of the fashion neckl@@ aces in the inner cities .
Muslims bury the killed in Mec@@ ca during the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are borne by Muslims at the first funeral in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia dis@@ closes the collapse in part of the gigantic Saudi bin Laden group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the slain who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed to Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mos@@ que .
mour@@ ners filled , largely dressed in white , the route to pay their respect when the first of the dead came their last journey to the Al @-@ Mo@@ ench@@ em cemetery .
the funeral proc@@ ession passed by the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane collap@@ sed through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the bed@@ side .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for funeral , when the Saudi King imposed a sanc@@ tion on the construction company of Bin Laden &apos;s family because of the disaster , which also left 3@@ 94 injured .
the bodies of 29 patients who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed through the Great Central Bank of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who were on his first pilgrimage , when the crane was falling .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi @-@ officials have already said that the H@@ add@@ sch to Mec@@ ca will continue with thousands who will continue to come to the city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today King Sal@@ man said , the Bin Laden group would not have let the crane arm the arm of the crane when it was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company was out@@ law@@ ed abroad .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man learned to reveal what caused the fall of the crane that rus@@ hed into an inner courtyard of the giant mos@@ que , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ ler , which was later this month .
the Bin Laden group did not publish any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for comment .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also imp@@ acted the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s large mo@@ p as part of the massive building project managed by the Bin Laden group .
the Bin Laden family has been associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is taking over major construction projects .
the late leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a apost@@ ate son ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the crash of the crane arrived in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said that 158 people remain in hospital .
government officials stated that 1 million ri@@ al ( Â£ 17@@ 4,000 ) must be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount to permanent injuries .
other publishers will receive half of this amount .

by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Bos@@ s correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is claimed that Br@@ its put their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified East European craftsmen who carry out the work in their home
if you are skill@@ fully dealing with a hammer or a brush for painting walls , you seem to belong to a minority today .
for the British increasingly employ arti@@ sans to perform DIY jobs in their homes , the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
V@@ Ã©@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , the new Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the Bau@@ markt @-@ chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe that offer services at low prices has now sur@@ passed .
King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 further Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops which focus on professional tra@@ des@@ people and close 60 sales outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchasing decisions were hit by women .
at the moment , men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this more strongly towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the head of a UK listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured their top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and CFO .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ fis@@ her reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and sales after the Group ow@@ es the cost of closing the shops .
since King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , King@@ fis@@ her will be opening 200 new stores .
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday , at the Landes@@ gericht of K@@ lagen@@ furt , two officials of the Austrian volleyball tournament master A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to answer for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and de@@ for@@ estation .
the def@@ end@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse .
from this alleg@@ ation he has been acqu@@ itted in full force in May .
the current process was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General , Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary examination , the accused cryst@@ alli@@ sed in the years 2006 to 2011 funds from club accounts , about which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions , used for private purposes .
the amount will be estimated at around 400@@ ,000 Euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sports officials are also accused of financial off@@ ences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fact was eliminated by the chair@@ woman of the Sch@@ Ã¶ff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
in rej@@ ecting the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that at no point an asset was created to the society .
sports officials only accounted for expense allowance and the sports club , for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the Pas@@ si@@ va in 2001 amounted to some 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euro ) .
&quot; at that time we stood in front of the situation : do we continue the club or block it ? , &quot; one of the def@@ end@@ ants , in the bread @-@ occupation of the financial office , told one of the def@@ end@@ ants .
with his colleague and co @-@ accused , he decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , put our life insurance policies as security in the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the arrival . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has been agreed upon : you can freely manage the money , no debt can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of financial success , the withdrawal of the allowance was retro@@ active until 1991 .
therefore a portion of the allowance was paid only years later , namely from 2003 , when an asset had been added to the account .
therefore , l@@ ump sum and not detail reviews appeared , the former chairman explained the processes .
the accounts and divisions managed the two def@@ end@@ ants together , said the second def@@ end@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the payments have not been disclosed to the association in detail , the judge asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has not been interested in the detail of the financial support , it is important to have been the freedom of debt , such as the answer .
when in 2011 an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the club &apos;s account against the one functional investigation for official abuse .
these were rec@@ lam@@ ents , the def@@ end@@ ants declared .
this securities account ran on the name of the second def@@ end@@ ant and was not known according to the association &apos;s statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know the answer for a long time .
then he finally said he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything of that money , the prosec@@ utor asked in the room .
the co @-@ def@@ end@@ ant was informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claims recovery &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why in@@ dem@@ nity ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
the first def@@ end@@ ant stated that he did not agree with this formulation because the association was never har@@ med .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You are all from the tailor &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a lawyer ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the function@@ ary said he never paid a c@@ ents salary , he only calcul@@ ates mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
he charged the association 1.000 euros per month to di@@ ets , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
exact documents for the early years could not show the accused .
they declared that these were no longer kept after an audit in which everything had been judged to be correct .
mil@@ eage allowance was also related to the second def@@ end@@ ant .
all the shifts are to be made in cash , and from his place of residence he had to drive from the international market to the Bank to Blei@@ burg , he stated in his statement .
the trial will continue on 23 September with the ques@@ tioning of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard passes another 30,000 jobs
in addition to the staff cuts that have been running for three years , the computer can reduce further jobs when spl@@ itting the company .
the US @-@ based Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) sub@@ missions do not come to an end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the breakdown of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment .
as a result , costs of 2.@@ 7 billion dollars ( 2.4 billion euros ) should be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will fall in the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 55@@ ,000 jobs that has been running for three years has not yet been completed .
at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP had a workforce of about 30@@ 2,000 employees .
the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ share declined 2.3 percent .
the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto Corporation , who has grown up with printers , is currently spl@@ itting up : this is how the computer and printer business will be bund@@ led together in a new society - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a more dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand of corporate customers after his services set the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer after Lenovo at last .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , the sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
the proceeds went back to 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP answers the changes in the industry with a spl@@ itting and massive adjustments .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only recently re@@ acted to the fact that customers are increasingly purchasing smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers , and more and more businesses do the same online .
Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age a total reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
however , a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would mainly result in rejection : 54 % responded by contrast , 35 percent agreed .
61 percent is positive that other countries fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria .
24 percent opposed to interven@@ ing in the conflict .
a co @-@ operation with the Syrian authorities , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , reject 51 percent of respon@@ dents , 20 percent would be responsible for this .
29 per cent could not decide .
car : second check @-@ in on the 6@@ 6th IAA
the exhibition focuses on connected , self @-@ prop@@ elling cars and electro@@ mobility at the centre of the fair by September 27 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mobility combines &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wide public can visit the IAA from Saturday .
as two years ago , the organis@@ ers of the Auto @-@ Verband V@@ DA reck@@ on with about 900 000 visitors .
R@@ Ã¶s@@ z@@ ke : erup@@ tion of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police took over several hundred displaced people at the Serbian border near R@@ Ã¶s@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ Ã¤n@@ eng@@ as and water @-@ lights .
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ Ã¡@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the aband@@ on@@ ment of the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it had formed a police line and behind the polic@@ emen was a spot@@ lights ready .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially ceased to use pepper spray .
after that the police used tear gas .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now withdrawn something . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees collap@@ sed and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the Ser@@ b police spokes@@ men also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US bank
the world ob@@ serves when the US bank arrives on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest rates are raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were inter@@ viewed by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of opinion that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates on the current stand of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent will be held .
it is a historical event because it is seven years since the F@@ ed Inter@@ est set on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a large central bank may exit the zero area and initiate a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , Head of Staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. economy is based on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global circumstances .
it warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good .
the decision should be announced at 08.@@ 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death Shel@@ ter at Delta State University leaves excuse for compensation
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleague and killed - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted to &quot; make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 am Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He killed someone and killed someone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb told the staff of the emergency call centre that the police had to send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb had no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ en@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted to und@@ o it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb ran 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen surrounded him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ en@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relation . &quot;
Pr@@ en@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she was married for about seven years as a &quot; good man . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ en@@ ss would have a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said Pr@@ en@@ ss had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ en@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ Ã©@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ en@@ ss , who owned a dog called Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb had ph@@ oned relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He doesn &apos;t go to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen pick him up on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb received a PhD from Delta State University in the spring of 2015 , as his curriculum vit@@ ae on the University &apos;s website .
stars who have lost their lucky charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years .
in 2001 , he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer .
the actor was also alleged to have been fighting with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession .
all this certainly calls for its tribute .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa is building the Group around
Lufthansa is planning a large Group restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year with a better organisation alone .
150 of the around 1000 executives around the world will cost the work of the Group .
meanwhile , there are new negotiations with the pilot union .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the low @-@ cost Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the objective of the real@@ ignment is a contribution to earnings of some 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline distributed on Wednesday .
among other things , there will be no more board member for the passenger business in the future .
the cheap airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
in future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the executive board for chief Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
with the real@@ ignment , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ scores the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in future .
up to now , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex .
the airlines operate under the roof of the passage Airline Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with pilots
in the conflict conflict with the pilot union cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations are to be resum@@ ed after the strike on this Thursday .
that divided the union .
the topic of talks should be the retirement provision for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a forecast record result &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; cockpit wants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to achieve predictable results as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and airline in recent months led to a number of strikes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the driver &apos;s transition , background is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; austerity concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is envis@@ aged that Lufthansa is lag@@ ging on the Group &apos;s own cheap line Eu@@ row@@ ings in the fight against competitors .

hat@@ ch Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ tures
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the League of Champions League defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
while this brought the left external def@@ enders to cry and will exclude him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ Ã©@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w had fallen into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated to the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double action and is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operating in Manchester .
it is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very hard and then plays fantastic , and then this happens .
he had an oxygen mask in the locker room .
he cried .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a Red Card and the Sus@@ pension of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , did not punish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al presum@@ ed that the Italian arbitr@@ ator had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself if I say a El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a tweet sent to Sha@@ ws account : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery now begins , I come back more strongly again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
related to this : Manchester United suffered the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in defeat at PS@@ V
with the European Championship in France , the England def@@ enders have an additional incentive to recover until the coming June .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Phil@@ lip Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , everyone is very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s very hard , because it wasn &apos;t his intention to hurt his opponent , and when you hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be .
I feel very ill with it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ Ã©s Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ der by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron doesn &apos;t know The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents learn soon : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t last long before you know it by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favorite children &apos;s book , the prime minister for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental label released in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it always seems to give a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good except that the following paragraph , which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book , instead re@@ prints a summary of the 2012 film version , adding new characters and details to extend the fairly short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams , &quot; reads . &quot; a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if this were not yet suspi@@ cious : the text presented by Cameron is partly read like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and so begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so un@@ familiar with the story of the book . here , an un@@ named boy hears how the local environment is rav@@ aged by the gre@@ edy , tree @-@ prone , Th@@ need @-@ kn@@ itting Once @-@ ler , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , snor@@ ting creature that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per that The Lor@@ ax had not read 20 times in a row .
a Dow@@ ning @-@ Street @-@ Spe@@ aker said that the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s electoral district office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no other immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
encounter@@ ing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when one sees the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map .
I would not exclude a forward victory .
A@@ last@@ air &apos;s side may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown quantity at test level , is an option for the attack .
related news : Adam Ly@@ th reti@@ res from the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th is of course hard to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
in his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results .
there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination because - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
a long time ago Ly@@ th could have been extended , but he had control over his own fate .
if he hopefully kno@@ cks out further sales for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there &apos;s another chance .
the England trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude even though he did not perform such good performances , and that surprises me not ; he is especially a team man .
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to put his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son in front of him - while Nick comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play back and forth .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first deployed Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales is coming in , and he &apos;s a drummer I set up .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he finished 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge place , which hit us very much .
he must have at least the same chances in front of him , but this depends , of course , on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to beat mo@@ een next to Cook , which would give an extra spin @-@ bowl and receive four squ@@ e@@ aks appeared , and I did nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed guy has already shown that he is a cri@@ cket player &apos;s devil .
mo@@ een might not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop , before he joined as op@@ ener in 2001 .
he has made three hundred R@@ uns immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner and in my limited contact with him he really impressed me as a young man .
people may see his stat@@ s - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inners that raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some smart additions to the trainer station .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ enen , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as advisor to the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game , who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played in all the conditions and against all the attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes to the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use into the setup .
I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices in the dressing room can bring fresh wind even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .
Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot won a similar break in Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some won &apos;t agree , but coaches and team @-@ makers do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit of Great Britain from the EU ) could gain access if the economy falls into a sl@@ ur@@ ry until 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ scheduled re @-@ trial strategy to hold Britain in the EU will go deeper with every day , even without the choice of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which viol@@ ated viol@@ ently on Tuesday for Europe .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ n and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at , recently , said that some member states , so deeply mired in various crises , as the EU now is and not always of their own guilt , United Kingdom itself created agenda with split conc@@ essions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes that they usually do not want to be satisfied .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zes social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb sum@@ mits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care if we are staying or going . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as it has happened with the over@@ power@@ ing long @-@ out like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ ter@@ rand ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s FranÃ§ois Hollande over@@ sees his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right @-@ wing government , Spain a lef@@ tist one .
it is hard to imagine that they are going to break a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most of them have similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies .
therefore some such ministers may even deliberately not plan helpful comments , entirely in the SN@@ P style , during Britain &apos;s referendum campaign to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process in 2017 , my friend believes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they did not during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entrance 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z Euro Opport@@ uni@@ sten , who has made a name for himself as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all his ins@@ anity , Ed knew who were his enemies .
this included Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , telephone @-@ h@@ acking ali@@ ens and pseu@@ do @-@ non @-@ nationals who own most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but noticed that when you sit in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , you better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of going to his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , as Bla@@ ir had the principle of the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a kind cla@@ p on the back on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me - seems to repeat N@@ eil &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 &quot; s , a mistake at that time and today .
it may take time , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC @-@ Sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is - I press it friendly - in development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional blo@@ om @-@ off tendency and the wild fol@@ ks of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism can say yes to everyone .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ i &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said , when the boy sc@@ outs strug@@ gl@@ ed in him not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be il@@ lo@@ y@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; Benn@@ ett &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their conference on Monday evening .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right not to give Cameron no free ticket to Europe , which allows him to keep label support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks like that .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ i reward economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for whom the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be required to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British when all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I remembered at the start on Monday of something that was called the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health UK &apos;s report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) were joined by Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fundam@@ ental Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extremely win@@ dy foundation &quot; where he founded his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the alleg@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the proof of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; the current best estimate is that e cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modeling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 individuals who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multi @-@ criteria Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) in order to result in their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose CEO should have received British American Tob@@ acco means ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed BA@@ T references to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding he should have received after reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International , added them .
the reasons for selecting the members of the board will not be delivered , but there are several well @-@ known E @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which include a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
the tobacco management of P@@ he also participated in the meeting .
the group &apos;s research work says that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most of the criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
however , none of these links or restrictions will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said the alleg@@ ations of P@@ he that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; premature &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims had already been re@@ acted before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies in his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the un@@ ambig@@ uous duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative dangers than tobacco .
nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die annually in a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
due to the clear presentation of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction .
BBC should quit East@@ on , says former boss of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs such as East@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs not broadcast by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs likely to be seen by a smaller audience in hard @-@ disputed tim@@ ers against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC &apos;s Director General , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that for six years in his time at Channel 4 , he tried to get in touch with the BBC .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or broadcast , which are also clearly shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communication Committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC .
if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , which I do not consider medium or long term for a good idea , one should at least put its production on programs that others do not do or give in order .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve wid@@ est possible support for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s of course non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financing programs that could be financed even without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ enders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people working there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts are giving back what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ tag@@ gart L@@ ecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows like East@@ enders .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal N@@ ic programs &quot; should go to BB@@ C4 , but they fulfill their tasks , and they can argue if they go to their apparent missions to justify 4 billion pounds of broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we &apos;ve created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the broadcast fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , all of you think that for Â£ 150 a year you get a great value , but for people who are a lot of money for the Â£ 150 , ask me if that is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 leader David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check its lithium mission to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC @-@ production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example in &quot; inform@@ ing , enligh@@ tening and entertaining &quot; to the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada .
on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , from which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers enter alli@@ ances in order to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetic &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulses , which have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by switching off motor neur@@ on cells genetically modified in order to carry the membrane channels responding to ultras@@ onic waves .
more on this subject : researchers read and write Brain Activity with Light
the researchers said the worms expressed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetic , where ultrasound may be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that the process of one day could replace the lower brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to people &apos;s brain for the treatment of symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread@@ worms usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bli@@ sters , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultras@@ onic waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells assigned to them , according to a report Nature Communications .
in order to create son@@ ic @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applied ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ waves and transferred into the worms where they turn on the modified Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ genetic , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that son@@ o@@ genetic could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that has to be sent down to the desired position in the brain by an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultras@@ onic waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin producing cells , he added .

according to Gav@@ in Grin@@ don , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists will become more critical and attempt to bring political works to the public outside galleries .
many artists join activists within protest movements to work and notice that they have to move outside into the real world , so that their art has an impact on society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ weapons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; posters sal@@ utes the commu@@ ter in the subway . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Am@@ ne@@ sty video was watched more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works non @-@ profit with the graphic artist and vo@@ ic@@ eover artist who works for free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence around advertising for the ce@@ ase@@ fire - through a void of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic z@@ wi@@ el@@ ich@@ ach company advertisement , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with light colours and animation it remains a stronger one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ ne@@ sty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we need now is an intervention by the British government and the guarantee that torture instruments are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally on our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative art around the weapons fair originates from the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors bl@@ ur fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in student residen@@ ces
eleven years ago I moved as self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old to a student residence , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those whom I have anno@@ yed - and the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed into eight simple rules .
the entrance to student residence ranges from slightly nar@@ rowing to absolutely sc@@ ary .
it is temp@@ ting to tie : people tell where you come from , where and where you have taken Sab@@ baths year , where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate because in the seri@@ ousness , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like as opposed to those you wouldn &apos;t talk to even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
let people do it .
people often turn into drinks reception , film night venues and communal meeting points , but they are also places where people wear and under@@ wear their under@@ wear .
referring to this : do not remember to start with a relationship at the university
intro@@ vert will receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a room @-@ to @-@ space B@@ um@@ mel @-@ culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friend@@ ships .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away to get the energy I consumed for interaction with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted by con@@ vivi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
talking about kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close friendship through baking .
as you begin the university at the height of the back @-@ man@@ ia , it is kno@@ cking at the doors of people to introduce themselves with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less wei@@ rd as the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I gave you something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poorly mixed lum@@ ps made of flour , sugar and fat cause people to fall asleep when you kno@@ ck .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check this with the milk holder .
the chances are good that they say to use themselves even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , this is annoying and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it more balanced than my room@@ mate who added a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
you should not make noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
it is not only about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people who sit in the glass house in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb .
a girl on my hall@@ way asked her neighbours if they were telling them something to make drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter than three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even lou@@ der music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbours to sleep two hours before they pl@@ under@@ ed their own music , shut down their door and went to their three hour test .
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would move in to the same student residence ?
conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be too much embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future spouse , get in touch with them , dis@@ connect and then see them every day and perhaps experience how they all come across together as friends ?
of course , the heart goes his own way - but if a hot fellow is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your abdom@@ en a little reason .
in the exciting moment when you notice that someone has his keys lying in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between a Ul@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good stroke is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but don &apos;t ch@@ ew someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but t@@ ack your possessions on the ceiling no more than twice .
row houses for refugees , single parents , small ear@@ ners
real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner builds town@@ houses in Central Fran@@ con@@ ia for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , for refugees , but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need housing , but also the mother and the poor ear@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build cheap and well @-@ built today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are being pushed to the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly the housing can be created : he builds town@@ houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for the people remain here for a great extent .
in view of the influ@@ x of refugees , we need enough housing in the coming decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
mer@@ cen@@ ary : a semi @-@ detached house needs the least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different when people are living in blocks of living .
each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units each for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
mer@@ cen@@ ary : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 Euros , without land .
that is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction lasted six months .
that is appropriate .
do the building regulations have complicated their plans ?
mer@@ cen@@ aries : I have correctly consul@@ ted my project .
particularly complicated is the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ cl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert Sonder@@ bau and the Stand@@ ing Ord@@ in@@ ance .
cre@@ ep@@ y and cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still under construction , who creates three apartments in a semi @-@ detached house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is the place lacking .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
mer@@ cen@@ aries : there were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
which is definitely not true .
but do you not ag@@ grav@@ ate competition for affordable housing ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; true is : we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but we have built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my project has the message , even the ordinary people need housing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
not only refugees , but also the single mother or the poor ear@@ ner .
I &apos;ll show you how to build cheap and well @-@ built today .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setup app , type &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after installation , as they get an error message saying that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update has failed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait for the rush to go back or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the deletion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able by stream@@ lining the updates . similarly , it will be easier to do this by using a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is finished .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone may be stopped half@@ way and this could lead to a down@@ fall of the update .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was founded three months ago , has added another member in its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who kept himself in Bad Kis@@ singen for more than 40 times .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the Federal Cross of Mer@@ it 1st Class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ Ã¼b@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann has supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation , which Chairman Alfred Klein received .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot afford the membership fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent search should also be promoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town .
district office looking for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the elderly care centre Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined forces under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new contact point at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
in addition to consultations , you can also attend courses there .
the social foundation draws it from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , immediately next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and advice on health insurance or services of health care and nursing homes will be available right away .
for years we have been working with our ambul@@ ant care service to ensure that nursing relatives are often left alone .
there are an endless number of questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not in@@ frequently , many of the health insurance benefits are not used because the complexity of insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new house@@ keeper J@@ utta W@@ eig@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and Ci@@ vic Hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
it is therefore possible to use additional offers such as prevention , memory training , or physi@@ otherapy treatment .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
both executives see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre particularly in demographic change .
this is because this makes a good de@@ centralized infrastructure essential in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration fes@@ tivities , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the reconciliation at the age : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and they invite to a regular soci@@ alizing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this makes the social foundation a big contribution to the fact that sen@@ iors are able to live independently and well in their familiar environment .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 a.m. to 6 p.m. and on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m .

men beating on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mÃ¼n@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 , three young men were walking from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mÃ¼n@@ ster .
one out of the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an , following the police gave his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the site of the gas station .
one of these men now shou@@ ted to the young man and hit his face with his fist .
the victim was suffering from a nose drop and ble@@ ed strongly from the nose .
when his two friends rus@@ hed and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ ckets , he first left off his victim .
the injured young man was brought home by his friends .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator pursued the group with a passenger car up to their apartment and passed there demonstr@@ atively several times .
when you no longer saw the vehicle , the wounded left the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
with the aid of a head@@ stock , one examined the victim &apos;s face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim .
the wounded had to be taken to a hospital for medical care .
so far only a vag@@ ue description of the day is available .
one of the men was about 1,80 meters in size .
the second rac@@ quet should have been about 1.@@ 65 feet tall and was clothed with a je@@ ans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police are asking witnesses and advice to sign up under the telephone number 0@@ 6@@ 181 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank MÃ¼ller takes over practice Fel@@ ce@@ ausen and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros
Silvia MÃ¼ller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank MÃ¼ller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ic@@ ausen .
the mayor , Bernd Bor@@ mann , Wirtschafts@@ fÃ¶rder@@ im U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert also look forward to this .
in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing : Dr. Frank MÃ¼ller takes over the practice Fel@@ ic@@ epr@@ ints on October 1st .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ sen@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing with half a job in the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase , MÃ¼ller will open the practice on 12 October , until then he has invested â¬ 3@@ 10,000 in the premises at St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic at first sight , when Frank MÃ¼ller and his wife met Frank MÃ¼ller and his wife Dr. Silvia MÃ¼ller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who is currently completing their specialist training at the Ver@@ den hospital and who wants to get into practice this year too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mill@@ ers would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ic@@ ausen , laugh@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far I just called her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple MÃ¼ller liked the idea to practice their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says 39 @-@ year @-@ old MÃ¼ller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss .
and so one agreed , the mill@@ ers bought the house with the practice .
meanwhile they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time family father Frank MÃ¼ller grew up there , his medical school in Hannover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed Chief Physi@@ cian in Di@@ ep@@ holz and is involved in the DR@@ K @-@ Will@@ ing@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
as of September 19 , the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ic@@ ler works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the mill@@ ers , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as a family doctor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia MÃ¼ller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress @-@ EC@@ Gs and need a talk @-@ room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
the mill@@ ers will receive a total amount of 50,000 euros in the framework of a funding program from the district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as from the joint municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and glad we are that practice will continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says vet mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia MÃ¼ller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , approximately 2000 patients come into practice in the field of rock @-@ breaks every quarter , in the North German average practice there are about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another house doctor &apos;s practice .
a positive side effect of the tak@@ eover by Frank MÃ¼ller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no follow@@ er had found himself , it would have gone too .
by the way , those who visit MÃ¼ll@@ ers &apos; consultation hours still look especially in familiar faces : take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power from the ri@@ ms .
with their f@@ arewell in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ended , after all , the doctors practi@@ sed there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ic@@ epr@@ ints rec@@ alls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they feel a little melanch@@ oly after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the female doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their man compl@@ ements : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pressed myself before gardening , now it could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ sons and is happy to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees by &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also raised at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior , Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to make a request for asylum can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this a matter of course . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people stand in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear that there are clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , not over the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it needs a controlled procedure .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
the Croatian government had previously reported that Slovenia also wanted to leave incoming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and under certain circumstances establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
the Interior Minister , Ves@@ na Gy@@ Ã¶r@@ kÃ¶@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however , did not see this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the border of the Schengen area .
as the Minister stressed , Slovenia is not willing to cut its borders for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ Ã¶r@@ kÃ¶@@ z Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours on Tuesday to leave the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in eastern Croatia to avoid registration .
the Croatian police could pick them up in nearby corn fields .
according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik is constantly meeting police cars with new refugees .
it is predominantly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country reck@@ oned with about 4000 refugees , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic , Minister of the Interior .
moreover , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , diver@@ ted towards Croatia , agreed on Wednesday by Croatian and Serbian media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the government in Belgrade denied that it was to encourage people to adopt specific routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , in the morning a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the in@@ mates were on the road all night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border around 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary joined us , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could now lead to a postpon@@ ement of the already predicted shift of the former Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west route .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country has prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not give details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strict controls are carried out in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently issued a good testimony to the country as far as the standard of border controls is concerned .
on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they spent the last night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , who leads to R@@ Ã¶s@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked .
it is still unclear whether the remaining refugees will continue to travel to the Croatian border .
the Serbian interior minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm Wednesday early in a local evi@@ den@@ ess in Hor@@ gos : he stops the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for premature .
it would not be possible to deal with very high numbers of refugees at this time .
one cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hel@@ pers advise migrants to - dangerous alternative routes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun distributing maps to the refugees on which alternative routes have been marked by Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border region there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian War still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .

Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok should have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals , which has been accused of providing insight into un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ Square and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
with the collected information , in@@ sider transactions are to be made on the financial markets .
according to the investig@@ ators , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our national borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in the SE@@ C communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce drew attention to its 20th anniversary with this action and is well faced with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went through action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce remedy is available to the p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by as well as for questions and talks like the volunteer staff .
while some p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by spontaneously acc@@ esses the chal@@ k and compl@@ ements the proposition about &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; read with the camper through the US , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; not suffer long , &quot; others stay short , read , say sentences like &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and then go on .
over and over there are little discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ Ã¼b@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I make it clear that for me some@@ time the end of this world comes , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Director of the Di@@ ak@@ on@@ ical Work Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband eger of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot;

F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial outlook lowered for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supply giant reduced its gain outlook for a whole year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its bo@@ d@@ transport service .
the company also said that she plans to hire about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by more than 2.5 percent in the pre@@ market trade , 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit of $ 10,@@ 40 and $ 10,@@ 90 in the financial year ending in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous predic@@ tion .
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower view comes in spite of increases in price , which are average 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on 4 January and despite higher allow@@ ances for bo@@ d@@ transport of heavy and large packages which will be collected from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result will increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher income and growth in online trading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company delivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid income &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for the holiday employment were announced one day later than those of the rival UPS , who plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labor , approximately the same number as last year .
in the quarter that ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to â¬ 2.@@ 42 per share , just below the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which had predicted twelve analysts from Z@@ ack &apos;s Investment Research .
sales rose 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion dollars .
six of the analy@@ st questioned by Z@@ ack expected a $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping over the past few years , which brought shipments to stagn@@ ation in its unit of express shipping .
but the boom in online shopping increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , net sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while earnings declined due to higher labour costs in the freight business .
in the pre@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , F@@ ed@@ Ex shares declined by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Strate@@ gies spend two days this week sitting around a 27 foot Hondur@@ an Mah@@ o@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to raise the benchmark for the first time for almost a decade .
threatening with them at the end of the two @-@ storey meeting hall is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed chair@@ person Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues shall set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double contract from Congress : maxim@@ izing U.S. employment and prices stable here .
but since the big recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict . it will be announced on Thursday that the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented incentive by the short @-@ term interest rate at the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy show that it is soli@@ dly growing , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il on the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxi@@ ous to reinforce this volati@@ lity by raising interest rates for federal securities - and be it just a quarter of a percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they are watching , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for an excuse not to increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty about the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which sec@@ ures itself the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase of interest this week .
the financial markets , however , expect to wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed raises the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts allevi@@ ate the blow by promising that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average value j@@ umped by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the set this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that an increase in net interest would calm the financial markets because they would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed good to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow sharpen@@ ing of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the sentence acquired .
although job creation slow@@ ed in August , improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level that the F@@ ed looks like full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets all over the world sent together at the end of last month , after China had de@@ valued its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage rate fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would stran@@ gle the global growth .
the market has recovered in this month , with the D@@ ow being now nearly 10 % below the peak of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation when the interest is to be increased .
&quot; if events on the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred over the past few weeks , they would attract re@@ ins in this session , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liners , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff member of the US bank .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liners .
the health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in the decision @-@ making process technically .
but in effect , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous .
the mere mention of the then leader , Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; their monetary expansion , spark@@ ed con@@ fu@@ sions around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can expect that they not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of Global Strategy for Asset Management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ ier , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reaction on financial market movements that are apparently not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ ier , unanim@@ ous member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who ple@@ ads for an increase in interest , quoted decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited noticeable effects on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only in the first place during a serious crisis such as the 2008 Market Date , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on Inter@@ est Det@@ er@@ mination of the Bank of England .
the recent tur@@ mo@@ il does not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest because the markets are upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed I do not think it should come ahead of time .
need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
yes , Chin@@ at@@ own
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
LA@@ X @-@ C is commonly referred to as Thai Cost@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market , which is also sold to the general public .
yes , it is in Chin@@ at@@ own and not in Thai Town .

there is even a car division if you need engine oil .
the shop is huge , and it takes about an hour to stroll through the ais@@ les .
if the whole shopping cart makes you hungry , there is a meal in the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ express .
the G@@ ark@@ Ã¼@@ che ( good and cheap ) in this shop is close to the cash des@@ ks and has different pick @-@ up options .
what is there : do you need anything - anything - Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .
products are inexpensive and a number of them are sold in large quantities .
fresh products include Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs , fruit and much more .
the meat counter is extensive , as is the fish bar - the staff behind the bar will clean and fil@@ et the fish and even cook on request for you .

where it is located : the shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chin@@ at@@ own and the city centre - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original .
parking : LA@@ X @-@ C has its own parking area , along with other shops and restaurants .
even if the shop is well attended , it is not difficult to find a parking place .
Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little help for life for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
to give you a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless voluntary hel@@ pers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
they belong to Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
even with her 74 L@@ enses , she still teaches .
every Thursday she does it at the asylum seek@@ er at the D@@ ill@@ inger StraÃe .
there they help refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , this is quite different than at a proper school .
Rio Grande &apos;s pedi@@ at@@ ric Society promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS seeks to enligh@@ ten women about how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck to breasts that are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should do .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet affects pregnant women and protects them from developing tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy child &apos;s diet can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ese sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be flat for solar panels .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited turn@@ around building at the Am@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ platz is progres@@ sing step by step : in the latest council meeting , the completed construction application has been unanim@@ ously agreed upon without major discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; before that , the committee decided , among other things , an application for an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the valid development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that a &quot; gab@@ led roof with a non @-@ carrying first and roof over@@ hangs &quot; is to be erected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar systems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was again about the roof slope , which for energy reasons - different from the development plan - should lie below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan regarding the roof@@ ing allows no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - with the Bern@@ ese Municipal Council generally rather restric@@ tive in the case of exemp@@ tion requests . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected to support school and l@@ ati@@ tudes .
in the next step , the construction application for the 18 x 36 meter hall will now be presented to the district office for testing .
P@@ ei@@ Ãen@@ berg Clinic moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital in P@@ ei@@ Ãen@@ berg is to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is the new medical director at the Hospital of Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ Ãen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county which confirmed the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ WeiÃ .
however , a decision on this will be made by the Supervisory Board , and the meeting conven@@ es on Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans were to be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees would continue working at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ Ãen@@ berg .
the overwhelming majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the existing internal station .
the rooms are available .
employees who do not work with Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ WeiÃ .
the employees are informed of the plans .
the change is triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been a medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year and is now transferred to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ WeiÃ , the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fischer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came into the game , who agreed to take over the leadership from 1 October and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this was in any case an &quot; appreciation &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the area &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ WeiÃ .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology at the inner station .
over the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the supervisory board agrees , will lead both houses until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ella , which still has 35 beds , is to be defini@@ tively closed in P@@ ei@@ Ãen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district has planned this for 2018 , when the current refur@@ bish@@ ment is completed at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital .
J@@ och@@ ner @-@ WeiÃ , the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , resist@@ ed that the house owned by the Bundes@@ liga was to be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I close it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ white could not say that there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a day psychiat@@ ry are accommod@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer on the Qu@@ asi move to Le@@ ch , who was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for over 30 years has not been given .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the Medical Director .
the hospital in P@@ ei@@ Ãen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened by closure in recent decades , departments have been closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .
the hand @-@ legs of the Rhine @-@ Neck@@ ar Leu@@ ven are called for the Berg@@ ischen HC tonight ( 20.@@ 15 hrs ) .
although the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , there is no occasion for arro@@ gan@@ ce .
in the past season , the bad@@ ener delivered a painful defeat at the Bh@@ c and made a difference there .
Jag@@ dun@@ no with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers were severely injured during ma@@ ize harvesting on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a ma@@ ize field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ kreis Witt@@ enberg ) several h@@ unters were in action , as the police informed .
after a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was unclear at first .
the det@@ ective police are investigating .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
in inter@@ ro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young@@ sters were killed and thrown their bodies into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who has been missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to a violent crime .
the young woman &apos;s body was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as the public prosec@@ utor and police on Wednesday .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who was also arrested on Tuesday evening , is considered to be active and led the investig@@ ators to the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ se .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was missing on Sunday morning after having arrived home in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in search of the young woman , the investig@@ ators first hit the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
in the case of inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing persons , there was a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year old .
the alleged perpet@@ r@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ p@@ se was found .
according to the authorities , according to the authorities , the police inter@@ ro@@ gated the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the cor@@ p@@ se into the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the Haf@@ hop@@ chter on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him dead .

refugees need quarters : study warns of housing gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking a affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is faced with a challenge .
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun .
with the incoming refugees and j@@ ob@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ bur@@ dened by large cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built every year by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of a study commissioned by the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison , 26@@ 0,000 units will be completed in Germany this year .
thus 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an emergency shelter .
many come across the housing market and enter into the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived for rent in the last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees .
the study also makes considerable om@@ is@@ sions in housing developments in recent years .
Germany is shooting down a deficit that will grow from year to year .
there are currently some 77@@ 0,000 residential units in the metrop@@ olitan areas , acc@@ ented by Matthias GÃ¼nther , author of the study .
for this reason , many professionals lived in large cities in need of room@@ mate shares .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults remained un@@ willingly in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the sl@@ ur@@ ry on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has declined again for the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , new incentives should boost the social housing construction .
in this way , the property tax could be wai@@ ved and the property tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats may be temporarily suspended .
in addition , attractive fiscal amor@@ tis@@ ation opportunities are required , according to the Alliance .
the funding programme for state bank Kf@@ W refugee shel@@ ters is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the approximately 300 million euros have been rec@@ alled on Monday evening with 184 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia set corridor a corridor &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is practically no more transit to Hungary , as more and more refugees are choosing the way to Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb announces the transit across Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia plans to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia via the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke with the Slovenian Interior Minister , and if necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the demoli@@ tion of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border hundreds of refugees immig@@ rated to Croatia to get to Western Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 500 people have come across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian television channel RT@@ L . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the eve of the day Hungary had concluded its border for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new laws which came into force on the same day make regular asylum procedures in Hungary virtually superf@@ lu@@ ous .
Croatia plans to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can go through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police took up the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the neighbouring country of Croatia in the morning .
most of the media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came to the Serbian border town of S@@ id with the bus as well as with taxis .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not come across borders .
for this , the border crossing holds other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mine clear@@ ers are to quickly create a safe passage .
after the closure of the border , hardly any refugees are coming to Hungary .
on Tuesday the police had 3@@ 66 challenged people .
just before closing on Monday there were 9@@ 380 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Hungarian laws stages the overcoming and damage of the border fence as a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
35 p@@ uni@@ tive proceedings were therefore initiated in the South @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
prisoners thre@@ aten prison sentences of up to five years and deport@@ ation from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the immigration authority , on Tuesday they received a total of 94 asylum applications in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transit zones &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a total of 94 asylum applications , of which almost all - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ Ã¶s@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees .
practically nobody has a prospect of being granted asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers are to be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ Ã¶s@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up in R@@ Ã¶s@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left at the road@@ side during the past few weeks .
lock gri@@ lles were min@@ ed and one of the recording camps in the bor@@ der@@ land was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express himself to the goal of this reconstruction .
Austria is only a few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
however , around 20,000 migrants still remained in the country .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people wait for the continuation of the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the instruction of German authorities .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mayor drove &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stolen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the border &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the bridge festival on Sunday we were busy with ti@@ dying when ten people were suddenly standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly abandoned the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday , because of the flood of refugees , it was an end for them in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his assistance and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the bor@@ dered together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
previously , we once again st@@ un@@ ned the unexpected guests , with snacks and drinks .
we immediately said that we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ã@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man refused to give a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this made us very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers had switched from an ICE in a regional train to Passa@@ u on Sunday evening in W@@ els , after the announcement that the railway traffic to Germany was stopped , but still trying to cross the border .
the regional train was stopped in front of the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the cross border is generally high in the course .
the BrÃ¼ck@@ en@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ alized , day before a two @-@ bridge @-@ run sporty @-@ organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ Ã¡n has sent further tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy : &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of helping the R@@ Ã¶s@@ z@@ ke camp immediately to establish structures that ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor has officially and publicly tra@@ cked the position of the Hungarian government into the dun@@ n@@ age of National Socialism .
leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans that are now confronted with chao@@ tic states in the border regions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the refugees will have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge in the face of the continuing refugee streams and the approaching winter to create decent conditions for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there will be an even greater - peace , security and stability uph@@ eld in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ resistant quarters
Konrad has to do all his hands with the provision of refugees .
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word has weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Bank to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees .
Konrad already got a grip on the chaos in the first reception centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen .
&quot; we have no more hom@@ eless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported of his first success .
the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday may also be accommod@@ ated without great hu@@ stle and bu@@ stle , &quot; said Konrad , and praised the organisational &quot; masterpiece . &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total Konrad reck@@ ons with a demand of 85@@ ,000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodation units have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are to provide countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there is no pit without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the Gover@@ nor .
they would have assured him of creating quarters for the coming refugees .
&quot; it &apos;s good in Upper Austria , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier .
the former VP Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph SchÃ¶n@@ born and will be clari@@ fied how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum @-@ ordin@@ ator also sets great expectations in the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ps like us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
private persons can easily offer accommodation on the platform .
in addition , it is hoped for hotels that are vac@@ ant in the winter .
yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in times of emer@@ gen@@ cies it could not be that arti@@ fici@@ aries have to respect a certain height of the towel @-@ holder or size of the clo@@ ths .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , that he was more successful in accommodation , Konrad reas@@ oned with his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older gent@@ leman , whom one does not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier don &apos;t charge the Republic as they declared themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees on three to four .
up to now , my own quest for lod@@ g@@ ings has not been successful .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz calls for a better division
for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as it is possible to support those affected at this time without these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of an emergency , however , further sites should be tested for their suitability .
the City Council critic@@ ises the division of refugees in the federal state .
other districts must also contribute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; borders are not sealed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a prolonged telephone conversation with Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ Ã¼hr@@ inger ( VP ) , on Monday , has corro@@ ded further action in the refugee issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders will not be sealed off . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there are now the relevant border controls .
there will be no special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being .
however , the seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ Ã¼hr@@ inger once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria now also carries out checks at its borders is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for P@@ Ã¼hr@@ inger from the actions of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general restoration of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new ship@@ yard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Linz &apos;s industrial line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the publicly tra@@ ded IT Group S &amp; T , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; in IT , the smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T Head Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine investing in the startup companies of the New Wer@@ ft and subsequently acquiring them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; right from the start , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - what Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an investment of EUR 1.7 million has been invested by S &amp; T , 3,@@ 3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of remaining area in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second shop in the ar@@ cade
Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are the centre of attention in the new shop .
J@@ utta Bes@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
this project had to be postpon@@ ed by the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , she has now gained an increase in the form of a further business location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop , opposite the shop , in which she sells bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are starting from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks were re@@ mod@@ elled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long considered whether I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location on which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz area who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who have their own Italian roots .
her fashion interest has been laid bare by her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I like most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women are in rap@@ ture when looking at a beautiful hand@@ bag , the expert woman can also not answer with the latest safety .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag is used for every outfit .
the ro@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose residents are called An@@ ders .
this property also links some to the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always well @-@ beha@@ ved .
whether he expresses himself in hos@@ tility to foreign journalists or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office strongly stir@@ s up the election campaign .
and cut it off well .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ Ã¶hn@@ fres@@ ser &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a term many in the wine village on the wine route . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some in the 1200 inhabitants @-@ village is related to it over -@@ nin@@ ety corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ stÃ¤d@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del rot@@ ated a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal , become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their everyday lives , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ stÃ¤d@@ ter filmed an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous children , including Tr@@ ump as well as the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of a big mouth &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - to high German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in high German : the sen@@ ders , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the investors .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;@@ sche success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
first corner@@ stone of the real estate group were first real estate purchases in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland for a long time failed at the Bavarian State , to whom the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged .
he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he was once without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , explained to the start of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal immig@@ rant &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of the descend@@ ant .
he repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he does , this is not so sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Grand@@ ma was a born tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement looks more dist@@ anced to the Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so cheerful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that drinking is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the Pen@@ sion@@ ists Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm insi@@ sts on how many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family at a visit ended something for the church organ , which was generally well anch@@ ored .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they find it better if he doesn &apos;t know the election because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if it is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like he , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wouldn &apos;t he have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah BÃ¼h@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not my president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe too without the president . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12 000 movie singers , also in the USA aw@@ akes interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper @-@ Bavarian municipality of Ram@@ sau in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Berg@@ starter Village &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 inhabitants village in the National Park Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday .
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain climbing villages . &quot;
in the neighbouring country , the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sunrise domin@@ ates the ratings , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at today &apos;s show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rush to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report subsequently to the loss of the leaders of the Liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts in the reviews for today .
the breakfast show by N@@ ine was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the German capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull achieved the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival sunrise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , stuck in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international TV shows including Dubai , New York , Niag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , as Sunrise achieved an average of 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators at the five main cities , compared with today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today a slight increase compared to ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number lag@@ ged behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , in the last few months , Today closed the gap to Sunrise .
in August , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 took place .
so far in September Sunrise with an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 viewers is at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change concern these morning people more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decided to settle with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators .
critics had wonder@@ ed if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of last night answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million spectators and slightly hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new quiz show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e , gave an average of 44@@ 6.000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia generated 5@@ 20.000 viewers and in the second half an hour was a full 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot Se@@ at will ultimately prevail around 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars minute that didn &apos;t manage to over@@ take the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three match : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
mystery un@@ veiled ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have apparently un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly obviously who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , at which Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor , was envel@@ op@@ ed in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who has received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on fel@@ lows on the day before they become three , you may have accidentally issued a note on who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the finale on Thursday
all three women have been ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , when the question is asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods &apos;s last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be their answers to the game destro@@ yer , who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both quickly - apart from themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and noticed Sam@@ s energies , I felt they were quite compatible and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah stands with both feet on Earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I saw them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood were well @-@ suited as a couple .
from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the house last week made it clear that Wood was &quot; the One . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now set to him without reservation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked what Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ led .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broadcast on Ten Th@@ anks on Wednesday , 7 : 30 p.m .
originally published as Sarah &apos;s first choice for Sam Wood ?
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the US - and there were many other teams that sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bench , as he lost a sc@@ ram@@ bling as the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League converter did at its first Pun@@ t return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a confi@@ ded to his husband and Hay@@ ne gave the next opportunity to a pun@@ t return and also to the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his real face in the locker room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a also strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team Co@@ ordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t that was restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; free voters call for the attitude of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn kl@@ au@@ r in GroÃ@@ wall@@ stadt , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned against a serious crisis at Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there are not correspon@@ dingly new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools in front of collapse , &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get off@@ ences in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state parliament of the Free Elec@@ tors conven@@ es until Friday in the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune .
actually , quite different main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free elec@@ torate @-@ meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the topic of asylum will over@@ lap the ho@@ of , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as it existed during the Yugoslavia in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , we must address the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free Elec@@ tor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to post@@ p@@ one the free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that is why Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded even more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum proceedings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards of federal states throughout Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria is pushing , others don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must become more able to act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the national policy should not fall under the table in big wall@@ ets .
many years of permanent bur@@ ners remain on the agenda : the education policy .
for the new school year , Cultural Minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) has launched a pilot study &quot; Inter@@ medi@@ ate plus &quot; at 47 secondary schools , with which an extension of the grammar school age is tested from three to four years .
but this is not far enough Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all high school students who want to .

4 people killed after police officers shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a four @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in Southern Nepal , after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mand@@ u .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , senior district official , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , some of whom threw stones and incen@@ diary bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal once said the police have used tear gas and then shot into the air before res@@ or@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets , which is known to be able to kill , which are traditionally used as less deadly alternatives , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ ras@@ i say that new provinces that are formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus , who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were engaged in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th century .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been governed centrally for centuries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but legis@@ lators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators have agreed this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kath@@ mand@@ u , and officials said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be built again .

Em@@ den - Em@@ den City plans to market an area of approximately 4,000 square meters in direct proximity to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
it is planned to use the premises for a mixture of trade , commerce and housing .
we wait for appropriate offers , it is called the city .
which investor does not come into question is not yet clear .

many residents are further worried - they fear the sell@@ out of their leisure time
for months behind closed doors was negotiated , gri@@ eved , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now there are plans for a new holiday settlement on the Small Sea near Em@@ den on the table .
the stakeholders , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den company &quot; System construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Municipal Development Committee of the Em@@ den Council .
originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP faction accused by investors and administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ isch left the system building management on the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all the questions , &quot; he said in front of the council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ours now .
the ten to twelve million euro project has been in discussion for months .
violent reactions among sea @-@ bu@@ d owners who came to the meeting called out the pictures and new details on the desired hotel structure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , sea @-@ boy owner and board member of the interests of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , lam@@ ents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be a huge stap@@ le that over@@ looks all other buildings &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , like some other project critics , he fears that traffic would increase sharply by the intended size of the system : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be whole bus @-@ loads in order that that pays off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , what is happening on the well one hectare area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we need to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ isch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still missing , the development plans were still variable .

Google launches campaign dou@@ bling campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a campaign of dou@@ bling of $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who have over@@ run the European Nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announc@@ ing the Don@@ ation call on his blog .
instead of giving a manager the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google associate , who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey includes many dark train and bus drives , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but as the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global collect donations up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / mil@@ estones will be doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely due to the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which drove more than 4 million people this year .
many flee from the war torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily overweight di@@ abe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether lightly obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial on the new J@@ AM@@ A Surgery study . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity operations have proven to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been performed in people who are path@@ ologically obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain measure of weight in terms of size , is regarded as normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I above 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ an Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital &apos;s data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and stomach ul@@ c@@ ers - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I of those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately the same at 29 .
among those undergoing a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes illness was completely dissolved and 28 % in part .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , the diabetes was completely only one percent , and in some cases only about two percent .
in addition , the results of the control of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the patient blood level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write .
after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease mortality in five years , the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared average results with the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ rek@@ tomy Group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved higher BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was among obes@@ e people who underwent O@@ bes@@ ity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it is so@@ othing for individuals with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long for people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly connected their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the Hun@@ sr@@ Ã¼ck
it is a topic that is currently increasingly paying attention to in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tually we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel may be interesting especially for Hun@@ sr@@ Ã¼ck readers , because he plays in Lang@@ wei@@ ler and the surrounding villages .
the main professional writer grew up in Lang@@ wei@@ ler and is pleased that she was able to set up a literary monument to her home town .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot take up all the refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the homeland of refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford that dedic@@ ates itself to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was indeed admir@@ able , but the situation was not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in cop@@ ing with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , we need to think about how the killing in their countries is reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack on 11 September and turned out that the US &apos;s violent reaction drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he had violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
4 times increase of consumption of hand dis@@ infection by children over the last 4 years
poison control centres in the United States report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 who swal@@ low a strong alcoholic variety of hands , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of revenue from hand dis@@ infection products in children under 12 years of age , the poison control centres reported , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them are landing in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children disinf@@ ect@@ ants drink pur@@ pos@@ ely while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in social media .
videos on YouTube show how young disinf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
young people have re@@ port@@ edly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with soft mou@@ th@@ wash to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think this is bad for him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent which are very appealing to children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
very few spra@@ yers can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation , especially in infants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the tox@@ in emergency center at K@@ ans@@ as Hospital , the Fox 4 broad@@ ca@@ ster in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you would not leave Gor@@ ky Whis@@ ky , but people leave these hand dis@@ infection products within reach of children , and when children come to it , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently took four squ@@ ir@@ ters of straw@@ berry sc@@ ents from the school , was brought to an emergency room .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice t@@ aller than the threshold that is legally considered drunk by an adult , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated it at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah sl@@ ammed her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors supervised them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had met her head , Rit@@ chie said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ bet@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal to my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ infection books and camp disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
in addition to alcohol intoxic@@ ation some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 two women in Ontario were killed after swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
health authorities assume that the product contains meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was listed as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth grade in the New York State planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by putting anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hand dis@@ infection and ban@@ ishes it from her room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; idle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plan and inter@@ ro@@ gated disciplinary measures to the school authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
in case of a collision at the cross@@ bar between the northern and the high@@ ways , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old car driver was easily injured during a collision .

as a result , he colli@@ ded with his truck in the rear of an audi@@ torium and pushed this vehicle to a Ford Fi@@ esta standing before it .
the police took part in the accident involving the accident victims of about 10 000 Euros .

&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of Cel@@ tic games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what interests them .
there is a lot of excitement in the old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Cel@@ tic has to fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ Ã¶ and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , now standing at the top of the table with five points ahead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cel@@ tic had bad times before and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what &apos;s happening .
we feel that exactly like that - but we have to go on .
we really need the support of Cel@@ tic because that makes the players better .
getting together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ ti@@ ously with January transfers
despite his comments just a few weeks ago , suggest@@ ing that he p@@ aired a few January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ Bos@@ s Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious when signing new ones and insi@@ sts that he does not want to interfere with the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x ca@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players who come in the summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Cel@@ tic @-@ Target Mich@@ u with reference guide
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ StÃ¼r@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Cel@@ tic during the transfer period in conversation , has indicated that he can withdraw if his contract exp@@ ires at the Sw@@ ans .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has pl@@ agu@@ ed with a fro@@ sty an@@ kl@@ es for two years and did not manage the departure from Wales this summer .
Hear@@ ts set to S@@ FA battle for N@@ eil@@ son &apos;s comments
the Hear@@ ts performed 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of the Defender was later removed - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said and insi@@ sts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not questioned integrity , I have not commented on any performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid Ty@@ te@@ ast@@ le
the in@@ cor@@ rigi@@ ble hi@@ bee was re@@ buff@@ ed after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive texts about Ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the Ros@@ eb@@ urn area of Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ te@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; it was a Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; said the stor@@ mer and added : &quot; it &apos;s safe to say that I don &apos;t return to Ty@@ te@@ ast@@ le if it doesn &apos;t play for Cel@@ tic Glasgow . &quot;
the Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United &apos;s board of directors still has confidence in the management team to turn things - but ad@@ mits that the decline has to end on the playing field .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the boys back to Tra@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Inn@@ es is glad to be &quot; un@@ fortunate &quot; against Hamilton .
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team of Aber@@ deen has to fight desper@@ ately against Hamilton Ac@@ cies in order to see a seventh consecutive league win , which gave them a lead of five points ahead of Cel@@ tic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is no team that has won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues , the games of this kind won &apos;t win . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it increases overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million during the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above that of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the figures of the National Statisti@@ cal Office ( O@@ NS ) showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland expanded by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland dropped to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost a year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the UK .
in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labor market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment .
dr@@ unken disturbed the process
because the security staff was not able to paci@@ fy the situation , the staff called the police .
only with the use of pepper spray could the officers put the stur@@ geons in custody .
a breath alcohol test gave 0.@@ 89 Pro@@ mil@@ le at a 16 @-@ year old .
the adol@@ escent was picked up by his mother .
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old had 2.@@ 15 Pro@@ mil@@ le and initially remained in custody .
why I &apos;m witness@@ ing an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will watch how a man is brought to death .
when it happens and I hope it doesn &apos;t happen I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation was made for the first time in January with his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the United States , and there are often more applications than places available , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place in order to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media spaces from 12 to five .
those who are selected will observe it emo@@ tionally .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p &apos;s close friend , with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma charges me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , as he wants , and you get access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could have formulated it better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks it is wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement will help against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ war@@ k , a repor@@ ter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all the details here .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the deed .
but I believe that there is a strong lik@@ el@@ ihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is incorrect .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters that you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die unnecessary death .
man after hum@@ id police ch@@ ase persu@@ ades to come out of the Cann@@ ing River
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist stayed dry when he talked the man from the Cann@@ ing River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang up the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to persu@@ ade him to gently persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale were called on Tuesday to a break in peace in the pool .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them towards Cann@@ ing River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he applied a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car to the dit@@ ch to escape an alcohol control and then tried to float across the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben cous@@ in bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards are trying to spy on him and thre@@ aten to end race sport
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria have tried to install a spy on his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity section of Racing Victoria and claimed that she conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai due to a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it comes to the positive cob@@ alt tu@@ ck sample at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had with@@ held 18 months due to the es@@ pion@@ age accus@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I &apos;ve sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; M@@ oo@@ dy said .
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
tonight I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to go about lifted head , and I want my owners to think that I do my best for them .
if they start thinking I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be a trainer .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously M@@ oo@@ dy had let the bomb go up in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart stayed in a room with a man - whom I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him employment in my st@@ ables to provide information on what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy to rac@@ ing.com .
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if this is the case , they should surely believe in their n@@ oses , because they failed in trying to hold me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at that time and are still today .
should this bring me to the point that it becomes personal ?
did the R@@ V@@ L behave cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people are thinking outside that I am it .
maybe they have to take my license and cast me off , and I have no doubt that what I say is now thinking about it .
but now I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainer &apos;s fru@@ stration levels were built up with Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s long @-@ going cob@@ alt examination , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said he could &quot; cast his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ defeated Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse &apos;s debate , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my employees mistakenly put mud on my leg .
it could have been the same yesterday evening .
it could have been the whole day like that .
but it was also on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter has been opened .
it &apos;s a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy claims against ri@@ vals for claims on ring fighting
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the tac@@ king of his players as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the ump@@ ires allowed the storm players &quot; Ring@@ fights &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a scar@@ c@@ ely concealed comment to the Storm team after his team had reached the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the rug@@ by league and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack of his crew and said they were only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team voted for him confi@@ dently , because it was because they were worried that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is emerging again and again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring fights when they beat us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have not changed our def@@ en@@ sive system or the techniques throughout the year . but over the last six weeks we have made contact with tac@@ kl@@ es a real focus , and this has brought us the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent is there for three years now , and obviously he has a great team to train . he &apos;s probably not getting used to it , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it &apos;s funny how this always appears at this time of year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Way@@ ne talks about exciting football .
he compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he will take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and see what we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like these .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think about us when it was about big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters game achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the play of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks doing and no points a thing exciting ?
for me it &apos;s the game boards .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase .
the Storm team has released this weekend because they have won the right to either meet North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on Saturday evening in the pre @-@ finale in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Serbian with 200,000 $ security deposit after drug attacks
a man who may have a life @-@ long penalty due to his attempt to get into the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which have been s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed to Que@@ ens@@ land , has been released against a $ 200,000 deposit .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was watched as he met his co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later in the CafÃ© Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where police found 40 kil@@ os of drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially life @-@ long penalty for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the entire amount and that in the cafÃ© might have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the danger of flight at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of the criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
M@@ si@@ movi@@ cs &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of $ 200,000 as security together to reach his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the declar@@ ative statements of the two people , it is clear that the issue of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he gives off his austr@@ ali@@ an and his Serbian passport , reports to the police every day and stays at an exit lock from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
crash on A5 at Karlsruhe : cab tears apart
in case of a collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe a lor@@ ry driver had been seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to move to the left at the last moment , as the police informed .
the accident causing driver &apos;s cab was completely torn apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely blocked by six hours until 2 am .
there was a damage of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone of girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es to send pictures
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ ator used the phone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when she was asleep , log into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of in@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately alar@@ ming her mother .
the police took care of this and saw the five pictures , then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web research that used terms to search for in@@ decent images of children .
H@@ og@@ g then said to the officials that he did it because it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es on the internet &quot; and he &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it was a ad@@ diction - that he was addic@@ ted to sc@@ aring people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said that it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten ped@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he was ill in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and crying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she also saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the def@@ end@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said the accused used computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation to speak to girls who looked much younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the indictment to have in@@ decent images taken by children on 14 June last year to have viol@@ ated the conditions on 25 January of this year and did not appear before the court for a hearing on 24 March this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defence lawyer Greg@@ or S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g does not appear in the register of sexual crimes , argu@@ ing that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be found in his crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict until October , in order to obtain background reports on social work .
H@@ og@@ g was given a deposit in this case , but was kept in custody due to hear@@ ings to other pending cases .
he was admitted to the directory of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of the judgment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schle@@ user &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diver@@ ts from small border cross@@ ings to Germany &quot; &quot; &quot;
more and more refugees are taken up outside the large control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many tu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers left the people on smaller border cross@@ ings because of fear of discovery and arrest .
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man for the Federal Police said .
along the Inn River Inn in the districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn , more than 1000 refugees have been taken up in the districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they had reached the German side by foot over bridges and dam@@ s .
there they are accepted by Federal Police officers and forwarded to the registration .
according to federal police data at Munich Central Station , there were again clearly more refugees in comparison to the week of the week on Wednesday .
around 700 people had arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 a.m. , a spokes@@ man in the morning said .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the town on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : clu@@ es of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the southwest awaits
met@@ e@@ or showers warn against storms in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , hot sea air is currently flowing into the country , shared by the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart .
the strong point is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; which was drawn from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic over the past few days .
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , the Black Forest , Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and the Boden@@ se@@ award with gu@@ sts of 60 to 90 kilometres per hour are still to be expected .
on Friday the sun can be seen again for a longer time .
the crowd makes it : every two years the car manufacturers show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
2015 is mainly on the move to compact cars , which are currently selling very well .
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations accounted for this segment alone , according to the German Federal Government Office ( KBA ) alone in August .
this is also reflected at the International Motor Show ( January 17 @-@ 27 ) .
a large number of new compact models are presented this year between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the trade fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive .
Opel presents an entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra cost from 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the Hessen supplies further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which the first three @-@ cylinder petrol engines are for the first time .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially just as five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the comb@@ i , which will also be seen at the IAA .
and what will be up next to the Astra at the IAA still on new compact cars ?
Renault MÃ©@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ competi@@ tor MÃ©@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the fair , the MÃ©@@ gan@@ e is exclusively seen as a five @-@ door in a conventional and sporty GT @-@ version .
in the trade he comes in the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 is brand new in the segment .
with the new model , the Nissan chair wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines is fully integrated into the design line of the brand .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
however , the offer includes a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and 82 kW / 111 hp output .
the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications .
the launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is scheduled for spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not completely new , but the compact class model DS 4 that can be seen at the IAA is completely new .
on the outside , the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ Ã«@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers presented his hand at the front end : the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn here and the modified head@@ lights are equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ otainment system was modernis@@ ed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and integrated into Apple Car@@ Play for the first time .
at the IAA in the compact class , there are also a number of re@@ visions and new variants , such as the open Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cells are human un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court admitted to an ex @-@ prisoner of the Te@@ gel prison , which was housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are accommod@@ ated in small cells .
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , the persons concerned may even hope for money if they were locked in confined spaces for a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in the Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel prison facility between June and November 2009 in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated .
after that , the man who is now on the free foot , according to his lawyer &apos;s instructions , was moved to a larger cell .
his term of discharge due to the un@@ worthy prison conditions against the country of Berlin failed .
however , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges raised the judgment of the Berlin Court of Appe@@ al and rejected the case for re@@ viewing .
they see the human dignity of the man hurt .
the Chamber judgment now decides on the amount of compensation
even if , for legal reasons , only a few days of liability for compensation were decisive for compensation , a statement of compensation was given , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ mining the legal protection of the personality would be afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber judgment must now clarify the amount of compensation for money .
in the past , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of law .
only in April they spoke to a det@@ ain@@ ee because he was imprisoned naked in a prison cell .
according to a decision from 2011 , human un@@ worthy is also the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed to a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff at that time was lod@@ ged between 15 and 21 hours daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
in recent weeks the Berlin pris@@ ons have also been hit head@@ lines for lack of personnel .
prisoners are therefore always included again and again 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness is rising , even to mal@@ let it should already come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the judicial authorities , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of offspring , 19 are to be dropped in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create this &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany ?
according to forecasts by the Federal Ministry of the Interior , some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated a resolution in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different forecasts , between 3@@ 50@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Construction ) and 400@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are used every year - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it is built so far ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all with affordable rental properties : annually , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 housing units fall out of the rental price binding , and these particularly favorable apartments will also apply to refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
not too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social apartments each year would have to develop and therefore the federal government would have to invest amounting to 6.@@ 4 billion annually .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , scientists and federal government ministers agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estimates of the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that in the long term 55 percent of the poultry in Germany can be employed .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education at the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation , critic@@ ises .
but for the integration of refugees , it is crucial if they find work in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the recording society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ Ã¤n@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , according to the German Thr@@ Ã¤n@@ hardt , a political turn@@ around has been given : from the ban on employment for refugees to recognize work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence light that restric@@ ts asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society , too , because of the shortage of skilled labour , the point of view is that refugees should be able to gain access to the labour market faster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is a lack of German knowledge .
so far there is no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often medi@@ ated by personal contact .
therefore , according to Thr@@ Ã¤n@@ hardt , the structure of networks is the royal road to work integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few managed parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the entr@@ en@@ ched parents it is only very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ sche@@ bar , spokesperson for youth and family in Berlin &apos;s Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ books in different languages .
if the demand for educ@@ ators is increasing due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of training , for example by allowing more specialised schools .
in the countries , students without knowledge of German are prepared in welcome classes for lessons .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is no shortage of them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Be@@ ate St@@ afford from the Berlin school administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no federal state asylum seek@@ ers or tolerated the study - the only exception was Berlin , inside Sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his stance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; willing refugees could become easier access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because refugees with a refund or den@@ ial are not receiving benefits after the asylum seek@@ er &apos;s law more if they start studying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the latter generally do not receive a B@@ af@@ Ã¶@@ g as they do not fall under the circle of the persons entitled to act .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; im@@ patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years so far in order to be eligible for B@@ af@@ Ã¶@@ g , from 1 January 2016 , this span is shortened to 15 months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this gap must be closed , too , for Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
students should get b@@ af@@ Ã¶@@ g immediately .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and religion is an important part of their identity for many .
the state should gradually grant the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and to further develop the existing state @-@ church right to a new state @-@ religion relationship .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic Wel@@ fare Association , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers in a professional manner .
the rights also include duties .
thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be willing to work with the state in many areas and to grant him some control options .
this also includes the willingness to take action against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to off@@ end such conflicts in Germany immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will continue to be a topic all over the society in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also have to change the majority society , the elimination of discrimination and rac@@ ism will be more urgent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a General Equ@@ al Opport@@ unity Act for a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it lear@@ ns very slowly , as the NS@@ U series showed , in which police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ wh@@ ites have long been demanding and what international tre@@ aties such as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention Germany have to commit , must become a reality in the coming years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens want to use their possibilities - for the good of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the currently expected refugees , says Dr. Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for man@@ - power and capacities , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system for this purpose .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery invites all newcom@@ ers to hand out health cards at the same time .
services rendered could later be rep@@ uted with the federal states .
in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to cut as many people with the limited service catalogue , which the asylum seek@@ er performance law fores@@ ees .
otherwise , doctors make it possible to create language barriers .
even so far , Berlin &apos;s health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are less informed about their diseases than other patients .
interpre@@ ting costs would not only have to be taken over in hospitals , even in doctor &apos;s offices .
but it would have helped many refugees with more general medical contact points in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among refugee children , for instance , there is clearly more un@@ addressed disability , and among young people it is about HIV education . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the partly other illnesses , German doctors come from their training , but clearly says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what concerns the shortage of doctors is by the refugees even allevi@@ ation in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians would have a highly developed education system , some refugees are even doctors .
in order to be able to practise , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take them again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill according to estimates of the Federal Psycho@@ therapy Chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder or depression .
Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K , is particularly vulnerable to vulnerable children .
a recent study conducted by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives traumati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder suffer , among other things , flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and fear of death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration disturbances , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
up to now , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seek@@ ers can submit an application for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social offices , cler@@ ks or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses will decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new st@@ aging &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Circus Pro@@ bst acc@@ esses the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to attract each age group under the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to dream on the brick walls .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my family of cir@@ cus , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ g and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current Man@@ e@@ gen@@ staged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the family for more than 33 years .
the family is therefore in the blood the gift for keen enthusiasts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take the people away from their daily routine and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almond cocktail with world city flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst , his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the Circus program convinces with talented artists from all over the world .
excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wi@@ t and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent movies the Cuban duo wants to take hold of it loos@@ ely .
light@@ ness and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art on the mast should conquer women &apos;s hearts by storm .
besides numerous salmon @-@ larv@@ ae , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus Pro@@ bst fascin@@ ates with inst@@ inct and jo@@ in@@ ty .
balance with the wheel on a ball ?
for He Yuan is no problem .
fascinating and frigh@@ tened people at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics , how little others and fascin@@ ates with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ab@@ norm@@ alities in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are too often subject to various animal welfare organisations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst looks at it : &quot; if we don &apos;t go well with our animals , we don &apos;t feel good either . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each pet@@ ting unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are lovingly called , will be read from the eyes if possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it does not want to go into the arena .
so the first commandment is good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra @-@ mare , the family Pro@@ bst is proud .
the two animals lived together in an enclosure for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our small jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for each visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if five or 1,@@ 200 spectators , we always do our best and are with all my heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to his performances from 17 to 20 September daily .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , for the performance at 5@@ pm the prices are reduced .
it is also open daily from 10 am to 6 pm .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe thinks false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , desc@@ ended from a podium by a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med but the video of the case quickly spread over the social media .
the opening of the parliament was also clou@@ ded by claims by de@@ pu@@ ties of the opposition to have received anonymous death threats and warned them of accompanying Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with Bu@@ hr@@ ung .
last month , they had rested him and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the Nation - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to interfere with Mr. Mu@@ gabe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warns the Parliament members concerned that immunity in the Parliament ends , and as soon as they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party headed by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will later split into two listed companies later this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing business hardware and service activities .
the expected job sh@@ edding results in a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , &quot; said HP in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , Chairman and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise becomes smaller and more focused than it is today , and we have a wide and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that help businesses transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; explains the company &apos;s statement .
it is a company that was founded by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard in the 19@@ 30s to produce electrical systems and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage man called &quot; the birth place of the Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has gone through a massive restructuring to handle the aband@@ on@@ ment of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the belief that closely focused companies provide better performance .
FC Ar@@ senal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ers have to stand behind the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the wounded Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger emphas@@ ised Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and in the face of its history his participation in the next summer is certainly still uncertain in the European Championship .
the great dis@@ grace with this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that not healed well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kl@@ es or with the injuries he had previously .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also acknowledged , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd. has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played 157 league games in only 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ als in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for ar@@ senal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , which have recorded most of the injuries .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ senal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a due time period , a time in which you have to strengthen your body and gain battle strength , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body stabili@@ ses , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
Ar@@ senal starts his champion league season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns a rotation inside the team .
H@@ Ã©@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ Ã­n and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need it to break a short break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Ar@@ senal &apos;s clear favorites are to advance through Gruppe F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest intim@@ id@@ ation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched during the last season .
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , being measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Ar@@ senal has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven away from the far hope of leading the association to his first European ap@@ oc@@ al triumph with his management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked with Ar@@ senal .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the Com@@ edy @-@ Show , which gives us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever before , as self @-@ murder rate among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year high level .
in 2013 , it was the main cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to address the problem , the Camp@@ aig@@ n Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a mis@@ erable life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man with the goal of ques@@ tioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study at more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that friendship can work .
in the age of communication led through social media , with its focus on substance on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , li@@ ke@@ able and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intrin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy luck .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was put on the head .
each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , shining through the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments during football coaching in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can refer to it in any case even though they are often reluc@@ tant to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of telephone pastoral care , I explained : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and are suicide is really clearly shown to me how even the smallest interactions between friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often don &apos;t feel able to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect on the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you talk about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the little moments of male friendship .
so much my objective out@@ sider &apos;s status about the phone may help people in moments of despair also help , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you attend this weekend com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the completely re@@ designed scenery to celebrate the day , why don &apos;t you take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , when you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G gr@@ ind Malm@@ Ã¶
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ Ã¶ .
di Maria meets with his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by Malm@@ Ã¶ .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ Ã¶ in the Prin@@ zen@@ park stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria scored less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League de@@ but@@ s as PS@@ G player , who brought the French master to the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head @-@ ball at the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against Swedish champion , as they do not only asp@@ ire to the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but as they got the points , it was not a class game by Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced by his hom@@ etown team and against the association with whom he began his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League , so it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , cause problems and look back relaxed even if there are certain things we need to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t scored another or two other goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which at the weekend could hold a 2 : 2 draw at its own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was ej@@ ected through Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ inian wing@@ ed stor@@ mer was called the man who can take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over last month by Manchester United , and he indicated why when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ Ã¶ defense before he shut down Johan Wil@@ and past the long corner of the grid .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would win a big win , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ Ã¶ , which suggested Cel@@ tic in a play @-@ off to reach this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine nation@@ alists in the field and was a heavy opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle ground .
but besides a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed by Kevin Cost@@ ner &apos;s posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they did little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G sometimes gave himself up , with some false pas@@ sports and bad connections , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who in no less than five attempts alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had put him after the re@@ boot .
nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c that Di Maria turned into a shot , which was directed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole ...
the second door finally fell short after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an scored his sixth season op@@ ener after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had caught a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ Ã¶ could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from a very short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the final result low before a substitute player E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi recognized a gate at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ Ã¶ , Age Har@@ ei@@ de later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last champion league game was last year in December last year .
since then we have only played in the Swedish league which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualifying games are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hats off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i plays for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern clearly stood shortly before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times cup winner , four times champion League winner , twice world champion , twice champion champion , twice world champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is stunning .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona 24 years ago and changed to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now betra@@ ys that he was already standing in Barcelona before the European Championship in 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ Ã§a wanted to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won &apos;t do anything at that time , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered also of FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reminder : in the summer of 2008 JÃ¼rgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this works today for the German Record Champion : pe@@ p Guardi@@ ola .
X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; Bar@@ Ã§a launched Guardi@@ ola and I played a great European Championship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavarian season 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against Bavaria over the entire distance on the grass , the reds out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s Triumph at the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confronted the African film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
as a result of the Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown was interrupted when he stressed the need for alternative perspectives with regard to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen scenario of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the occupation of the film and not with the instrumentation of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with offen@@ ded un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comment@@ aries of the actor of The Mar@@ tian consolidated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I would like to ask people to think about - whoever will be the director - as they treat the figure of the Harmony , &quot; Brown said first .
the only black person , and she is a nut beaten by her white hal@@ ves .
the producer of Dear White People prevailed for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the director rights to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that her direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter user Mr Po@@ oni pushed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on &quot; talking about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO K@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et served more than 5,000 re@@ ets and 4,000 cases since its publication .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when the exact ra@@ cial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
after being killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the teen@@ ager Michael Brown killed Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter &apos;s national impact and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against color@@ ec@@ king .
in February the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album still matter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
in recent times , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published a statement in response to the question of Fox News personality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crow@@ ned first champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first ath@@ lete to win the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prize of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which finished their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant which could complete all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
the last task was climbing a climbing rope of 75 feet in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the period with which he was the first ath@@ lete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of a sudden ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , won &apos;t get any prize money .
according to the rules , money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and the life changes , it receives the great rati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;ll get any gru@@ dge about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he did .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Isaac would have felt the same if they had changed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season , the shooting will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers s@@ ne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand in the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but on Tuesday they played perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field .
the T@@ wins took a chance to climb within one half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , even if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word , which was so difficult to handle over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories have fun no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad F@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon uph@@ eld his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit 6 times in the 1 / 3 inside and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bul@@ l@@ pen each game , and therefore I want to go completely into the game .
the designated Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle nav@@ y on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung the head@@ land well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said El@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( kick training ) , looked clearly better at the Bull@@ ring , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the am@@ bush at the end of the seventh day , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Field of Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy ran a wall , the only man he was confronted with , before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who tore a Two @-@ Run for the right @-@ handed man Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the gradu@@ ation run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th time in the Major League in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ge hit a double play
after adding a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth century , Wall managed a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tiger , Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed man , however , st@@ ole S@@ ano with three pitch for his fifth save .
Detroit benefited at the start of the game from a still not moving Phi@@ l Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been painted before the game from the injury list after missing more than one month because of a back @-@ suffering .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitch in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ B@@ atter , Hus@@ bands gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up the middle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 successful series with Run@@ ners in the scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third , which ended the threat .
the tig@@ ers set in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE on 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ it@@ or .
he has not beaten very well , but he has caught the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the rel@@ ic right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es it came to three rounds with six hits and a walk with four stro@@ kes .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the throwing shoulder .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list due to a shoulder distortion , is supposed to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z out of the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is removed from the vulner@@ ability list to start against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30th July
he has been missing in the right hip joint since the 20th of August .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ota &apos;s R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees to come to Wiesbaden in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people in it will then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city Wiesbaden told on Tuesday evening .
they calculated with 450 to 750 arriving refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared in the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can be temporarily accommod@@ ated there .
they should then be distributed to other communities .

Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the decisive reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he accused the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective post@@ ures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , we were pleased that the ch@@ ali@@ ce of a military involvement in Germany passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends on our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase of international aid to the refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Germany , Austria has again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Austrian minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said on Tuesday evening in Austrian broad@@ ca@@ ster ORF , no one will be sent back to Hungary .
also Germany did not send back refugees to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it &apos;s so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been talks between the General Director for Public Security and representatives of Germany .
they did not call them concrete numbers and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees had come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit for next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not yet been able to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of further 120@@ ,000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the strong refugee problem in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the first recording and distribution of people .
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of deliber@@ ations with the prime ministers in the Federal Chanc@@ ellery in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined that those who need protection would also receive it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but those who do not have a lead perspective can not stay in Germany either .
this opinion had been strongly parti@@ tioned in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now face a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort of force &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilomet@@ re @-@ long border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border to Romania could also be brid@@ ged with a fence .
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said about the new border fence , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had crossed the fence .
according to e@@ ye@@ witness accounts , thousands more migrants in Turkey went on their way to the Greek border .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the moon is slightly stag@@ gering on its orbit around the ring planet .
although this motion is only small , but still too large for a continuous cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( New York State ) on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trade journal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus .
&quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had already discovered ice @-@ vul@@ can@@ es at the south pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds in 2006 , sp@@ itting water vap@@ or and ice particles , and thus feeding the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn .
at least at the south pole there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed then .
the extent of the hidden ocean was , however , not cleared .
R@@ ama missing in 1860 MÃ¼nchen several weeks
the 1860 MÃ¼nchen has to ren@@ ounce Val@@ det R@@ ama for about a month .
an investigation revealed an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury in the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association announced .
R@@ ama was compl@@ aining about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Munich lion , the diagnosis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is expected to be four weeks of forced break &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is difficult for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we must reflect now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director Nec@@ at Ay@@ gÃ¼@@ n of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view of the possible commitment of an un@@ compromising professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a training guest , however , the six@@ ties presented a defensive fist .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and previously had a contract with the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at is currently &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opportunity to prove his skill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his conc@@ ussion , Tor@@ sten Ru@@ bin O@@ ko@@ tie can return to the team training next week .
already on Thursday the Austrian national player is supposed to enter the running training .
O@@ ko@@ tie had injured in the game at Fort@@ una Dus@@ sel@@ dorf ( 0 : 3 ) at a violent clas@@ h on his head .
contrary to his first fears , however , he remained without a serious stroke .
no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but those who want to pay attention to his slender line are often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because man@@ goes contain relatively high sugar , especially su@@ c@@ rose .
nevertheless , the exotic fruits are healthy : in them B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor of beta car@@ ot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thus support vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ go should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
the peel color alone does not tell how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste naturally pure or in sweet dishes .
however , a man@@ go gives a special touch to sav@@ our@@ y dishes .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well to fish , poultry , lamb and game .
the US Par@@ cel Service UPS returns up to â¬ 9@@ 5,000 for the Christmas business in the United States .
the company has already started recru@@ iting seasonal workers , shared UPS on Tuesday .
in particular , drivers are sought .
last year , UPS had increased its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 staff .
in view of the bo@@ oming online business , UPS and his competi@@ tor F@@ ed@@ Ex have taken precau@@ tions since last year to be prepared for the Christmas business .
in 2013 , delayed deliveries brought forward harsh criticism to the parcel service .
first fen@@ cing tower , then striking cold front
in the coming night , the F@@ Ã¶hn winds through in the valleys of the Alp@@ enn@@ ord side , as met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland announced on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night for th@@ urs@@ day , the fo@@ eh@@ n blows partly with storm @-@ strength through the fo@@ etus @-@ valleys .
after fen@@ cing on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front which brings heavy ra@@ ins , wind gu@@ sts and a drop in temperature .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area over the British Is@@ les in a strong southwest @-@ current .
on the north side of the Alps , the F@@ Ã¶hn winds through the valleys during the night .
as a result , the F@@ Ã¶hn blows into the fo@@ eh@@ n valleys with gu@@ sts of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ i @-@ land partly also with more than 100 km / h .
the F@@ Ã¶hn can advance into the adjoining Mitt@@ ell@@ and and on the mountains there are even hur@@ ri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h possible .
while in the north on wed@@ n@@ esday frost prev@@ ails for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity starts to st@@ ow away at the mountain slope .
rain starts here , which stops until Thursday evening .
in total , in the next 48 hours south of the Alps , with some more than 100 liters of rain per square meter , this has to be expected in the last few days .
on Thursday morning the blow dryer takes off the air , the result is a cold front with strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east via Switzerland .
together with the cold front the wind fresh@@ ens up to stor@@ my temperatures and temperatures rise sharply .
the following days are in the north autumn at 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the contrary , it is sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees on the weekend .
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz in Rome .
on Wednesday , in the presence of President Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was christ@@ ened on the name of the German Re@@ former .
at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now acknowledged as the &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an der Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the ancient Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the work community of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran congregation in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es have often been able to live their faith only in secret for centuries as a minority .
in a symbolic way , it becomes apparent that the tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 for a few months in Rome .
at that time , he felt the city as a poor man of sin .
his negative impressions are likely to have reinforced him by histori@@ ans in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then introduced the division of the Oc@@ ci@@ dental Church with his theses against the deport@@ ation of deport@@ ation .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus , with the crown of gold ( gil@@ ded ) , is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with sum@@ p@@ tuous pictures .
in the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 designs formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means equivalent to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , it can be quite glo@@ omy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for three years Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subj@@ ectively artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; book of all books &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are cycles that dedic@@ ate themselves to topics like cru@@ ises , pl@@ agues , commandments or pat@@ ernity .
he immediately fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books .
and there is especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus translated into current contexts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of old painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quotation of Martin Luther and one sentence of the artist , who formulated his very personal thoughts on the respective situation .
the necklace has gold letters .
thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
ultimately , emotions were the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and raised in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict prot@@ est@@ ant ruler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since education was already on the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt re@@ members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work up that , perhaps to bear my father &apos;s father again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to put art back to more value in a faster time : &quot; today &apos;s perception of visual worlds is characterized by advertising , and that is noisy .
symboli@@ sm is sup@@ planted .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewers to &quot; fall in &quot; into the images , let them look at themselves , discover and sense the power they have : &quot; the image seeks its counter@@ part . &quot;
in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation &apos;s presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost had always been a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his paintings . &quot;
old have not taken care not to fully grasp the Bible , but have chosen the themes that are important for him , including mysterious subjects .
&quot; this was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; Alt@@ ep@@ ost says : &quot; here is the pictures , the text just explains . &quot;
for Hans M@@ Ã¶h@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ Ã¶h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ rail approaches
plans made , place , company commissioned to model earth bum@@ ps for a round trip : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X train it was again an end .
failures in politics and administration ensured a dr@@ astic increase , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway .
so hill off , new place looked for - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the approval will go down in October , the first municipal coun@@ cill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck has now been able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the former indoor swimming pool should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further pause &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B broad@@ ens its commitment to refugees by 2019 , and the Bundes@@ liga cat@@ ers for a clear sign on the weekend .
the football respon@@ ds to the intensi@@ fying situation in Germany and ass@@ ures the policy of its help in dealing with the problems facing it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody can say in principle that it doesn &apos;t work me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has to interest everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he intends to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the Chancellor &apos;s office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ã@@ zo@@ Ä@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will certainly play a central role in this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football could and would help .
but the decisive course must be the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association has therefore expanded its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019 , &quot; explained Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the ver@@ ge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some federal lists also support this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already this weekend the 36 professionals set a clear sign when they will carry on the print &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logo ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen , Head of Sports Ru@@ di VÃ¶@@ ller of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes on everyone , no one can see them away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we football @-@ Bundes@@ liga , no , we must use our radi@@ ance , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot;
the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Championships on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German football &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fact that all 36 license agreements in their places started their own projects is great .
just as great is that small and small clubs are there .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; that we spent is lived in football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year , together with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government , the association will provide 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : head of the SAP executive board loses an eye in case of accident
the chief executive of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
during the accident on the staircase in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell on a glass jar after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost inde@@ b@@ bled , was impot@@ ent , then sli@@ pped out of the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; co @-@ founder of Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could do his job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we met before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Platt@@ ner said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was there during the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an interview with the &quot; SÃ¼d@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced that he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the S@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually sw@@ ings between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such personal history , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can do something like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up again when you have fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except bra@@ very ...

he therefore comes as little as reserve main@@ tain@@ er for the two Stam@@ mp@@ il@@ oten Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button as a reserve main@@ tain@@ er on weekends as well as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
soccer : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes rested on a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first match of the Europa League .
the national player will also be missing the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga in du@@ el with the FK K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot resort to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel for Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach left open : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the high load on its pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its trunk to the Re@@ us position .
he announced a change to the Tor@@ que &apos;s position .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of master @-@ keeper Roman brus@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Soccer Teacher praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Whe@@ el@@ f@@ eller is used in all Europe @-@ League matches in the future , Tu@@ ch@@ el left open .
with a high probability he will also contest the second game .
the for@@ ebo@@ ding statement by fellow player Re@@ us that the final introduction for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , Mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l thinks that Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants leadership role for Germany
according to the federal government &apos;s will , Germany should be technological pione@@ ers in the process of changing cars .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the house of transport ministers Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday in Frankfurt Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility age &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and provide less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , who come together with representatives of the industry at the International Motor Show .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport highlights , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid growth on digital radio .
testing of new technology currently results in a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; avoid any additional liability risks &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legal framework conditions and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use internationally to increase the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only fores@@ ees the human being as a driver .
in automated driving , the car is increasingly taking the lead , the driver becomes more and more a passenger .
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on free@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads will not be expected until 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany , the authors of the study estimated about EUR 8.@@ 4 billion in 20@@ 25 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD transport politi@@ cian S@@ Ã¶ren Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in cases of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still look skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey commissioned by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday , commissioned by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the inspection agency Dek@@ ra , comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not believe in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe in it at all .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents up to 20@@ 25 are reck@@ oned with autonomous driving cars , in the US 33 percent .
anyway , the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the digital alliance Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads .
on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could nevertheless be 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 percent .
well , every fourth would not leave the car under any circumstances .
B@@ oll predic@@ ts team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
according to current status , the DÃ¼sseldorf @-@ based DÃ¼sseldorf plans to open only in sing@@ les from 25th September to 4th October .
the final decision should be made at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys learned it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are strong enough , even without Timo to win the title , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ trainer JÃ¶rg Ro@@ Ã@@ kopf at the European Championship in DÃ¼sseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ship tour in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo , the disadvantage is that we are now no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Single European Champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who launches the S@@ etz@@ zeit in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded of the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo was missing , and we became Europe champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should ori@@ ent ourselves to this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the World Ran@@ king Fi@@ fth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English football team Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has drawn a serious injury to the right leg .
during the Champions League match at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven , the defender was met at a tac@@ kl@@ ing by H@@ Ã©@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and replaced after long treatment .
the first diagnosis revealed the 20 @-@ year @-@ old player of Bas@@ tian pigs to a break @-@ in .

it is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax figur@@ ine cab@@ ar@@ et : designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights are mannequins that look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the great star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from September 18 at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially le@@ aning attitude to a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; An exhibition was a bit after death for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it concerns tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly ever @-@ looking work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed complete artwork for which much effort was done : to fr@@ inge the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was especially engaged .
according to the manufacturer Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have had 14 tons of material .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special treat : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can also be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashion attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he wasn &apos;t a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , Gau@@ l@@ tier says .
his parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later taught the design of fashion himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
he did not pay the models for his first fashion show .
they got nothing but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of Gar@@ dine - P@@ lau@@ en lace as fashion niche
earlier we went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and spi@@ kes were created in large quantities for customers , for example , to further processed them to blankets and she@@ ers .
this alone doesn &apos;t work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of P@@ lau@@ en , Germany .
instead , fashion is again important .
in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ en tip , fashion played a major role , was then sup@@ planted by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , for accessories such as bags and for regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion that leans against past styli@@ stic periods is an increasing order potential .
those who don &apos;t use niche in the textile branch in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already make half of all orders .
P@@ lau@@ en , together with nine other companies , is a member of the Industry Association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and Sti@@ cker@@ eien .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken off .
private specialized shops and wholes@@ al@@ ers are no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
today , the bulk goods are manufactured much cheaper in the Asian region and are distributed almost exclusively through chains .
exports are also weaker , up @-@ to @-@ date to Russia and the USA .
enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also seeks to score by environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains from the embroi@@ dery issue in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year we have a quality seal showing that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
teacher U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schne@@ e@@ berg branch office of the West@@ sÃ¤chs@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ der@@ ies and lace .
in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , one has to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the companies that must first of all think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter rev@@ amped the historical snow@@ ball point .
the machine sti@@ cks small spheres at some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gol@@ ds@@ mi@@ thing master Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ K@@ rau@@ Ãe took his inspiration from it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that I could not start with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex procedure , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reu@@ ter said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and its surroundings and would like to have a reminder .
with that I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ en tip .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
legends should not be touched , but Disney still dar@@ es to watch a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; however , it is not about re @-@ fil@@ ament but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes place 20 years after the first film with the magical children &apos;s girl . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the Great Depression in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
but the director has already written : Ro@@ b Marshall , last with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema .
XI pus@@ hes to open the economy more broad@@ ly for the world
the economy must open wider to the outside to promote growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group that was tas@@ ked with the steering of reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should be committed to attrac@@ ting foreign investments and know @-@ how and improving strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Leadership Group for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
promoting new start @-@ ups and driving reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; said X@@ i .
the leadership group adopted a series of guidelines , including a list of neg@@ atives aimed at regulating the market access , relaxation of border controls policies , promotion of state operations ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the local reporting system .
after the statement , a negative list will be created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment .
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
the initiative is of importance as it as@@ signs a greater role in the allocation of resources to the market , guaranteeing a legal business environment and shaping the market more open , &quot; said the statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to the companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also stated that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas are opened for private investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded businesses and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and making the application process easier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right of the lawyers to guarantee their activities , and to employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli took part in the meeting as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limits of mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and to give consumers a clearly higher dose of the tox@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which has a corresponding EU working paper , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of mis@@ leading industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force to pregnant women and infants , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish , are to be lifted from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury each kilogram of fish .
however , large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish are already so strongly poll@@ uted with mercury , that around 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches are not allowed on the basis of the still valid limits .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ sal@@ able .
according to F@@ ood@@ watch , in return for this e@@ asing , the EU wants to exac@@ erb@@ ate the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries , such as car@@ p , are usually so low that they already meet the planned peak values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the reduction in Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de distra@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal which is highly toxic to humans , which accum@@ ulates in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish above all in pre@@ dat@@ ory fishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government therefore cau@@ tions that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already small amounts can cause very small amounts of damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Ministry of Environment says on its homepage with regard to the valid maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury enters the environment primarily through coal combustion .
according to a written information from the Federal Environmental Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power plants come across more than six tonnes of mercury each year , two thirds of the total amount em@@ itted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and widespread &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had quoted from paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish have already been among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
