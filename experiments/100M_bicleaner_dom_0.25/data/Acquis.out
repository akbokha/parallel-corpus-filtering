&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol together . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures to be applied when implementing the provisions of Part I by means of securing measures .
the aim of the method of securing measures laid down in this Convention is the timely detection of the bran@@ ching of significant quantities of nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons for unknown purposes , as well as deter@@ rence from such a turn by the risk of premature discovery .
for the enrich@@ ment of the target specified in Article 28 , the material book@@ keeping is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , association with spatial integration and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical completion of the inspections by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which for each material balance zone the quantity of material not shown for a certain period is specified , indicating the accuracy limits for the given me@@ gen .
in carrying out their investigations , the organization makes full use of the security system of the Community in accordance with Article 3 .
the accounting and control system of the Community for core material in accordance with this Convention is based on a structure in material balance zones .
in the application of their security measures , the Community shall make use of de procedures and measures of the following kind and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are determined in the supplementary agreements and are expe@@ dient :
a ) a measurement system for the determination of the quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost or otherwise removed nuclear material and stock ;
B ) the evaluation of reproduci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) Proced@@ ures for the determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) procedures for ass@@ essing accumulation of non @-@ measured inventory and non @-@ measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and reporting system , which indicates the core material inventory and the changes in this stock , including the input and output of the material balance zone , for each material balance zone ;
g ) precau@@ tions which ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ure to reimbur@@ se reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures in accordance with this agreement do not extend to material in mining or ore preparation .
B ) ur@@ an@@ ium or th@@ ori@@ um@@ ous material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under letter c ) , shares the amount and composition of the material provided that it is not introduced for specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaving nuclear material suitable for the composition and purity for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is produced , or is this nuclear material or other material produced in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , is subject to the other security measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The hed@@ ging measures envis@@ aged in this Convention are terminated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . however , if the provisions stated in Article 11 are not permitted , the Community believes that the recovery of nuclear material , which is under the provisions of this Convention , is not possible or desirable from residues , so the organization and the community consult each other on the use of appropriate securing measures .
B ) The hed@@ ging measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community unanim@@ ously establish that this core material is practically non @-@ profitable .
at the request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es the following core material from the securing measures according to this Convention :
a ) special fis@@ sile material when it is used in gram or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
( B ) Nu@@ clear material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 , if such core material is recovered , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % .
on request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es the core material that otherwise would be subject to securing measures in accordance with this Convention , provided that the total amount of nuclear material released in the States on the basis of this Article is not at any given time .
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special p@@ alt@@ able material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with enrich@@ ment , which lies below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ an@@ ium , is calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ an@@ ium and depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) Tw@@ enty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if the material is to be freed or stored together with nuclear material , which is subject to the securing measures according to this Convention , precau@@ tions are made for the re@@ use of the securing measures on that material .
the Community meets with the organisation of supple@@ mental agreements , which are necessary in the scope , which is required for the successful and effective fulfillment of the tasks of the organization according to this Convention , in the individual as to how the procedures laid down in the Convention are to be applied .
the supplementary agreements can be extended or am@@ ended without amend@@ ment to the agreement between the organization and the community .
the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the Organization , the Community and the States undertake all the efforts so that these agreements can enter into force within nin@@ ety days of the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the inclusion of the organization , the community and the states .
based on the initial report mentioned in Article 62 , the organisation establishes a summari@@ zed inventory of the whole , the hed@@ ging measures of this agreement underlying the states , irrespective of its origin , and carries on this inventory based on the subsequent reports and the results of its post@@ ings .
between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , the Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organization ) on the other
the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low in@@ comes whose development is hin@@ dered by common resource problems .
C ) The aim of the E@@ EC and the Member States is that the contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of the entry into force of the agreement , and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
D ) The E@@ EC and the Organization have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed execution and management of this agreement and the central bonds to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
for this purpose , the organisation of the E@@ EC has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria specified in this agreement .
the organisation establishes a special account under the name &quot; Special Account &quot; which is derived from the funds that the Member States carry out to the Special Trade account in accordance with this agreement ( in this property the organisation is referred to as &quot; car@@ et@@ aker &quot; ) , and only to the purposes set out in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement .
the special transaction account is managed separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the fees shall be paid as follows : a ) The payment shall be made in the form of cash or in@@ trin@@ sic bonds issued by the Member State , which shall pay upon request in the currency of the respective state in order of the organisation as the administrator of the special transaction account and to deposit at the deposit of the organization in the respective country .
B ) The payment shall be made in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first at a rate of at least 45 v . h . the application within 30 days of the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the Administrator at the appointed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution on 1 January 1979 or at another time agreed between the E@@ EC and the Administrator , taking into account the deadlines stipul@@ ated for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Every member state may , upon request , make payments before the above @-@ mentioned dates .
according to the usual procedures of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker takes approximately proportional accordion dra@@ ins to the cash or the school jun@@ ta in order to cover the expenses for the transaction loan and balance the special transaction account in an appropriate manner .
in the granting of these loans , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the E@@ EC :
III ) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the current and fores@@ eeable economic problems of the country ;
( VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its subsequent lending capacity to loan terms with no discount ; and
VII ) the extent in which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
every transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and swiftly exp@@ and@@ able development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral plan ) , which is considered , approved and managed , according to the procedures and practices used for the organization funded by the organization , under letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement .
the funds of the Special Account may not be used instead of the funds of the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organisation , which are bound for a programme or project within the scope of a loan or loan , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .
apart from Section 4 , Special Lo@@ ans are subject to the same re@@ payment terms that apply to the development loan granted to the organization ; they are therefore ref@@ und@@ able in 50 years in ten free years .
transaction Lo@@ ans are issued in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts to pay this fee are to be paid directly to the organization that it reserves .
each transaction loan is to be identified by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , where the source of the funds is specified .
the revenue from any transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services which are produced or provided i ) in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries that are members of the organization and which , in accordance with what the administrator has appointed at the time of loan granting , may be a recipient of a transaction loan .
capital re@@ payments of transaction loans take place on the special transaction account , and the amount paid back in this manner in the currency of a member state shall be re@@ mitted as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned .
the car@@ et@@ aker teaches the E@@ EC until the full disclosure of all transaction loans by the directors in preparation and via the projects and programmes approved by the directors .
during the time of the payment of the transaction loan , the administrator teaches the E@@ EC quarterly on the development of the transaction loan and the expenses that have been made there@@ for .
the administrator con@@ veys the E@@ EC as soon as possible after completion of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the transaction accounts with an opinion of the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this account closure .
after full payment of the transaction loan , the administrator of the E@@ EC reports as soon as possible a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account .
the administrator creates and carries out appropriate records and invoices , from which the contributions to the special action account , the amounts to be financed from the account , and the amounts paid out of the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States .
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ akers work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
for this purpose , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker to the full edition of the funds of the special transaction account from time to time have an exchange of ideas about the state of the special action account , the progress of the programs or projects financed by special transactions and beyond any other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , which the E@@ EC and the organization may agree , the agreement and all obligations of the parties resulting there@@ from are invalid with immediate effect .
if the total amount of the loan granted by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all obligations of the parties resulting there@@ from are terminated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States have notified the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities the conclusion of the proceedings concerned .
the Sec@@ retariat leads these noti@@ fications along with a notification of the proper approval of this Agreement by the E@@ EC to the Organization .
this agreement becomes effective and occurs in force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications in the organization .
this agreement is written in two documents in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , with each wording being equally binding .
whereas the agreement in the form of a letter change to the amend@@ ment of An@@ nex A of the Protocol number 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is to be concluded :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the area of controlled fusion and plasma physics
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EURO@@ P@@ Ä@@ IS@@ CHE Atom@@ ic Energy Community , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eur@@ atom &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Commission &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bundes@@ rat &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this program includes the creation of a large trial facility , the JET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) project , whose construction and operation will be transferred to a common company based on chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Common Enterprise JET . &quot;
for several years , Switzerland has been engaged in research in the field of controlled fusion and plasma physics and is well acquainted with the area concerned .
as far as practical use of controlled nuclear fusion has yet to carry out extensive work , it is in the interest of the contracting parties of the present agreement to summari@@ ze their respective efforts in order to avoid unnecessary overl@@ aps and to speed up their respective research , which have reached a higher priority level due to the energy crisis .
this agreement is intended to put any contracting party in a position to avoid unnecessary overl@@ aps and accordingly the common goal of these research work , i.e. the cost @-@ competitive electricity production by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction to achieve faster .
to achieve the aim of the present agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes defined in An@@ nex I and II , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Swiss Program . &quot;
to ensure effective co @-@ operation , the Swiss programme takes over the long @-@ term goals and forms of cooperation with the Eur@@ atom Programme ; it is subject to or altered by the organs mentioned in Articles 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement , that may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom programme .
each time the contracting parties accept a new program , this is the place of the programmes listed in App@@ endi@@ x I and II .
the association planned in paragraph 1 is carried out by : - adequate participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and execution of the programmes of the other party ;
- Exchange of personnel under the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , in Switzerland and in the third countries , with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; associated third states , &quot; as well as the laboratories participating in the Eur@@ atom programme ;
- mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programs .

&quot; &quot; &quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom contributes to the fact that Switzerland is involved in the time of the entry into force of the present agreement on the promotion of human resource exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the affiliated organs , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agreement on Human Resources &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with regard to the JET &apos;s participation in the JET , Switzerland is part of the current issue of the present agreement to the Common Enterprise JET whose statutes it accepts .
Eur@@ atom also ensures that Switzerland can become a contractual partner of any contract whose purpose falls within the scope of the present agreement , except association agreements or other similar contracts that are concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity of the present agreement .
the bodies charged with carrying out the association designated in Article 2 Section 1 of the present agreement are described in Articles 5 to 10 of this Agreement and in the Association Agreement .
in particular , the association agreement should include the implementation of a steering committee , the competent representative of the Commission and the Federal Council .
- to monitor the development of research and to direct the best possible results in line with the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group used within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme - herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VG &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the VG , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters concerning the ongoing or planned programs and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom programme , is responsible for all research and development activities on which this agreement relates .
it particularly promotes co @-@ operation and coordination between the affiliated organs and alig@@ ns its T * edness in the interests of both parties to the common objective specified in the Eur@@ atom programme and in Article 1 of the present agreement , whereby the scientific and technological developments in the world are du@@ ly considered .
according to its Rules of Proced@@ ure , the VG will appoint one or more Swiss representatives to the consultancy groups created within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme whenever the relevant Swiss authorities request .

the agreement could be closed up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor country , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion financial units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future supply funds of member countries .
already now , however , some conditions are mentioned below , which the BI@@ S would be prepared to use .
with every stand@@ by credit , BI@@ S would initially assume a commitment for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als , but not exceeding five years .
in the event of the opening of the loans as well as in their event@@ ual renewal , the BI@@ S would charge a credit opening commission .
in addition , the first dra@@ fts would not be made before the end of a month after completion of the stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the draw would take place in the currencies available at the BI@@ S at the end of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods of time that would take into account the funds of the bank , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those which the BI@@ S applies at the time of business carried out under similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to the market rates .
however , if the BI@@ S has to acquire the necessary funds on the market itself , the interest rate that may be applied to the application could reach a maximum that corresponds to the corresponding margin raised by the Li@@ bor .
I would be grateful if you would like to share with me the consent of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ S could include stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of credi@@ tor countries if the banks submit a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would like to share with me the consent of the Council of the European Communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all the tested blood samples that contain the an@@ tigen that is hom@@ olo@@ gue to the antibody or another substance stated on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not appear : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured twice in a suitable medium by repeatedly di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be examined .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; di@@ lution is calculated exclusively for the volume of the blood cells in@@ undation in the total volume .
for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents that are to be used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organisation has established international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for the determination of the blood group , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity , standards are developed at the time .
according to the definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the tit@@ ans observed in individual preparations red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination of most speci@@ f@@ alities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ cs , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation .
the ti@@ tre gives the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mix within a series where a micro@@ scopic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , available for the International standard preparations ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as a complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown re@@ agent in comparison to the International Standard Prepar@@ ation ( see Bul@@ letin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 ) .

if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties should be maintained for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in liquid form according to the label is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents indicated on the label is based on the results of the shelf life tests ; it is approved by the state regul@@ ators .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is so closed that no humidity can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by further drying of phosph@@ or@@ ous pent@@ oxi@@ des at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority can determine that the agent ( or solvent delivered with the dry re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to produce the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .

re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent contained in a vessel is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity in a container must be so large that the contents may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has to record written records through all stages of production and checks of re@@ agents for blood group determination .
adequate samples of all re@@ agents issued are to be kept from the laboratory for a long time until it is prob@@ able that the batch is no longer used .
the re@@ agents used in the blood group can contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective part , the others are the necessary tools to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are divided according to the origin of their effective part into three groups .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin .
each container is a black and white printed label in English and French , which contains the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,

in the cases of Article 7 , the competent authorities are convinced as far as possible that the information contained in the copies of the registration in the individual process sections coinci@@ de .
( 1 ) To ensure a smooth movement of goods between the contracting parties and to facilitate the discovery of ir@@ regul@@ arities or infrin@@ gements , the customs authorities of these countries ask one another on request , or - if they consider it from interest to another contracting party - from all available information ( including administrative reports )
( 2 ) The legal assistance may be denied or denied if the country considers that the administrative assistance would affect its security , public order ( &quot; or@@ dre public &quot; ) or other essential interests or viol@@ ate business , business or professional sec@@ rec@@ y .
( 3 ) In the event of refusal or refusal of the administrative assistance , the appropriate decision and its justification for the asylum seek@@ er shall be communicated in@@ competent .
