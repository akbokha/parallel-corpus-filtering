<seg id="730">The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low incomes whose development is hindered by common resource problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) The aim of the EEC and the Member States is that the contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of the entry into force of the agreement, and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">D) The EEC and the Organization have consulted each other on the proposed execution and management of this agreement and the central bonds to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">For this purpose, the organisation of the EEC has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria specified in this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="734">The organisation establishes a special account under the name "Special Account" which is derived from the funds that the Member States carry out to the Special Trade account in accordance with this agreement (in this property the organisation is referred to as "caretaker"), and only to the purposes set out in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement.</seg>

<seg id="739">C) Every member state may, upon request, make payments before the above-mentioned dates.</seg>
<seg id="740">According to the usual procedures of the organization, the caretaker takes approximately proportional accordion drains to the cash or the school junta in order to cover the expenses for the transaction loan and balance the special transaction account in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">In the granting of these loans, the caretaker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">III) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the current and foreseeable economic problems of the country;</seg>
<seg id="743">(VI) the composition and the tendency of the country's debt service and its subsequent lending capacity to loan terms with no discount; and</seg>

<seg id="749">Amounts to pay this fee are to be paid directly to the organization that it reserves.</seg>
<seg id="750">Each transaction loan is to be identified by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator, where the source of the funds is specified.</seg>
<seg id="751">The revenue from any transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services which are produced or provided i) in a Member State; ii) in developing countries that are members of the organization and which, in accordance with what the administrator has appointed at the time of loan granting, may be a recipient of a transaction loan.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments of transaction loans take place on the special transaction account, and the amount paid back in this manner in the currency of a member state shall be remitted as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned.</seg>
<seg id="753">The caretaker teaches the EEC until the full disclosure of all transaction loans by the directors in preparation and via the projects and programmes approved by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the time of the payment of the transaction loan, the administrator teaches the EEC quarterly on the development of the transaction loan and the expenses that have been made therefor.</seg>
<seg id="755">The administrator conveys the EEC as soon as possible after completion of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the transaction accounts with an opinion of the external auditor of the organization to this account closure.</seg>
<seg id="756">After full payment of the transaction loan, the administrator of the EEC reports as soon as possible a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account.</seg>
<seg id="757">The administrator creates and carries out appropriate records and invoices, from which the contributions to the special action account, the amounts to be financed from the account, and the amounts paid out of the account and the repayments to the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the caretakers work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">For this purpose, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the caretaker to the full edition of the funds of the special transaction account from time to time have an exchange of ideas about the state of the special action account, the progress of the programs or projects financed by special transactions and beyond any other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
