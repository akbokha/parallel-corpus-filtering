it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. enter@@ tain thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental illness , in which the patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal sen@@ timent ) alternating with periods of normal mood .
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al problems if the oral ing@@ es@@ tion of the medication is not possible .
for both diseases , the solution can be used for taking or the melting tablets in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
for patients who take other medicines at the same time , which are broken down as well as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this im@@ pairs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between nerve cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole seems to be primarily a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; partial ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole like 5 hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in less degree than the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters works to activate the recept@@ ors .
as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole helps to norm@@ alize brain activity , thus reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing its recur@@ rence .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms has been studied in three studies over up to a year .
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies of 80@@ 5 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar disorders that had increased un@@ rest over a period of two hours versus placebo .
in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence in 160 patients with which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study involving 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased un@@ rest , with that of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients was examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution to take in ( recording ) .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly greater reduction in the symptoms of increased un@@ rest than the patients receiving a placebo .
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively in four of the five short @-@ term studies than placebo .
in addition , abili@@ fy prevented the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes of previously treated patients up to 74 weeks and was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo to relieve the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , nausea ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , nausea , nausea , nausea , hyper@@ secre@@ tion ( increased sali@@ va production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients with predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes were addressing the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were predomin@@ ant .
in addition , the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in rapid control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd approval for the marketing of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the entire European Union .
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and discussed their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day , regardless of meals .
an increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
considering the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after initiation or replacement of an@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no elevated su@@ ici@@ dal risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disturbances ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ dispose to hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including ac@@ ro@@ cell@@ ed and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which lasted a year or less , occasional reports were reported about Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
if symptoms and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occur in a patient treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy , consideration should be taken to reduce the dose or break down treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that suggest a M@@ NS or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be dismissed .
therefore , in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions associated with sei@@ zur@@ es , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be used with caution .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis that are associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
there was , however , in one of these studies , a fixed dose study , a significant relationship between the dosage and response for un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including Abi@@ li@@ fy .
there are no exact risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ph@@ ony , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored with regard to a wor@@ sen@@ ing of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is required if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines with over@@ lying side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , decreases the rate of res@@ or@@ ption of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ isation , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabol@@ ites .
considering the joint gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , the potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as i@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
after setting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be raised to the dosage height before the start of the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , together with Abi@@ li@@ fy , can be expected with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials dos@@ ages of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ method xy@@ morph@@ ine @-@ R@@ atio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( om@@ me@@ pre@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( d@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ phi@@ c ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
due to the insufficient data situation for safety in humans and due to concerns raised in the reproductive studies of animals , this medicine may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefits clearly justify the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against using hazardous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects were more frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia were compared to patients treated with Hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment was 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 1 % in patients with O@@ lan@@ z@@ zap@@ ine therapy .
man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - in a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment was 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment was 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term recovery period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment was 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
CP@@ K increases ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally transi@@ ent and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
the adverse events associated with an@@ psych@@ otic therapy and their occurrence also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in elderly people with dementia , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death sequence .
there is no information about the efficacy of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is of benefit in the treatment of an over@@ dose , since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma retention .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor and for ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a and 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ Reci@@ receptor .
in dosage of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks to healthy volunteers , posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of binding of 11@@ C rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , at the nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on the put@@ sch .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study in week 52 was similar to the proportion of respon@@ dents who had a response to the study medication , similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measurement scales defined as secondary course targets including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression rate scale showed significantly greater improvement than with Hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher rate of decline , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % under placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective was &apos; weight gain &apos; , a weight gain of at least 7 % was observed in significantly less patients ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial for 3 weeks with fixed doses with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trials for 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
also in week 12 , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a comparable percentage of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of man@@ ia , such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which in part did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy with therapeutic serum levels , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation period before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar response , predominantly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ ulation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ lam@@ ation is cataly@@ sed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole with extensive metabol@@ ites via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ ites via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , nor did pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination showed no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no signs of clin@@ ically significant differences regarding ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with various liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions to their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety mac@@ rop@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated dosing , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not identify any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in doses or ex@@ positions which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent secondary kidney toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ Pig@@ ment @-@ Acc@@ um@@ ulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase of adren@@ al @-@ kidney carcin@@ omas and combined adren@@ al cor@@ tex aden@@ omas / carcin@@ omas ( 10 times the middle steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations of the sul@@ fate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gate concentrations of Hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole found in the human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of Hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l found no more than 6 % of the concentrations observed in the study over 39 weeks in the g@@ all of monkeys and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro sol@@ ubil@@ ity .
these effects were observed in rab@@ bits following dos@@ ages which led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 @-@ times of the middle ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

15 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which lasted a year or less , occasional reports were reported about Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
22 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation period before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of bi@@ polar decline , predominantly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .

it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective was &apos; weight gain &apos; , a weight gain of at least 7 % was observed in significantly less patients ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial for 3 weeks with fixed doses with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study comparing the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole as a solution to the intake of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geomet@@ rical C@@ max average of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Fur@@ ther@@ more , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
these effects were observed in rab@@ bits following dos@@ ages which led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 @-@ times of the middle ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
abili@@ fy injection solution is used for quick control of det@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder when oral therapy is not appropriate .
once clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment should be terminated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution and commen@@ ce with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
to increase the absorption and to minimize vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under circum@@ fer@@ ring adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) can be administered depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account the medicine used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy melting tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution .
there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with det@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , which were otherwise caused by schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution , patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) .
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug toxic@@ ity ( prescribed or illegal ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disturbances ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ dispose to hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including ac@@ ro@@ cell@@ ed and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which lasted a year or less , occasional reports were reported about Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , muscle stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ic , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored regarding a deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ dation was greater compared to the dose of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in a study where healthy subjects were administered intra@@ muscular ( 15 mg dose ) and the same time lau@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) was in@@ tra @-@ muscular .
105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , decreases the rate of res@@ or@@ ption of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ isation , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in comparison with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
after setting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be raised to the dosage height before the start of the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tra @-@ muscular was the intensity of se@@ dation larger compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone .
the following side effects were more common in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria : common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
the following side effects were more frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment was 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment was 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term recovery period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
CP@@ K increases ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally transi@@ ent and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
the adverse events associated with an@@ psych@@ otic therapy and their occurrence also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in elderly people with dementia , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant improvements in a@@ toxic@@ ity / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as a@@ toxic@@ ity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant increase in the symptoms regarding the toxic@@ ity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am reference arm .
the observed average improvement from bas@@ eline value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9,@@ 6 for lau@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ gi@@ bility , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be detected because of a reduced number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( or@@ ally ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study in week 52 was similar to the proportion of patients who had a response to the study medication , similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 73 % ) .
current values from measurement scales defined as secondary course targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ depression rate scale , showed significantly greater improvement than with Hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a significantly higher rate of decline , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % under placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective was &apos; weight gain &apos; , a weight gain of at least 7 % was observed in significantly less patients ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which in part did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy with therapeutic serum levels , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabil@@ isation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to placebo in view of the prevention of bi@@ polar decline , predominantly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C is 90 % bigger the AU@@ C after the dose of the same dose as a tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the mean time until reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated dosing in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which was 15@@ - and 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg in@@ tra @-@ muscular .
studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after intraven@@ ous application did not concern safety @-@ relevant concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 @-@ times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety mac@@ rop@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated dosing , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not detect any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in doses or ex@@ positions which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; thus , they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent secondary kidney toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ Pig@@ ment @-@ Acc@@ um@@ ulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase of adren@@ al @-@ kidney carcin@@ omas and combined adren@@ al @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 81 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed following dos@@ ages which led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 @-@ times the middle steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters of previously had an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole administration or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with a medicine containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines .
in view of only those who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the efficacy indicators such as time to the wor@@ sen@@ ing of the disease and survival .
on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer were aware of these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it must also not be used in patients that breast@@ feed or have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in their blood prior to treatment .
the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el in patients where the first treatment was not more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs , and that in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs it does not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited for the marketing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients receiving first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and which is not indicated for a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils number &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy C 3 is used to inter@@ rupt the treatment until an improvement is reached to degree 1 or 2 , and with all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adjustment in patients with mild to moderate liver function impairment ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies with patients with impaired kidney function and there are currently no sufficient data to recommend dosage adjustment in patients with impaired kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 due to insufficient data for harm@@ lessness and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is a alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could have substantially other pharmac@@ ological features than other form@@ ulations of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment is initiated , and the patient must not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in patients no new abrasion treatment cycles should be initiated until the number of neut@@ ro@@ phy@@ ton@@ ics has risen to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the plat@@ el@@ et number has risen to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly identified cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity associated with Abra@@ x@@ ane has not been proven , cardiac occur@@ ren@@ ces in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
in case patients after the treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea , they can be treated with the usual anti @-@ eme@@ tics and con@@ sti@@ tial means .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or in child@@ bearing age , who do not practice an effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is inevitable .
women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will be advised not to bear children during and up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised of a sperm conservation before the treatment , because the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility is due to the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very often ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequent ) , which can affect the transport efficiency and ability to serve machines .
the following are the most common and most important cases of side effects that occ@@ ured in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , which were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III trial .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most eye @-@ catching hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of the patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 lists the side effects associated with the dose of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy at each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) .
occasionally : elevated blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , elevated cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :
dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue burning , dry mouth , pain in g@@ ums , loose stools , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , pain in the lower abdom@@ en , ul@@ cers in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract :
pain in the chest wall , weakness of muscles , neck pain , abdominal pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal muscles , flan@@ k pain , discomfort in limbs , muscle weakness Very often :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive in relation to a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events has been established .
Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules active agent that promotes the de@@ position of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabil@@ ises mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation results in in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in con@@ veys the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ um@@ in receptor and a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation occurs in the area of the tumor due to the alb@@ um@@ in protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast carcin@@ oma is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ arm non @-@ f@@ aded studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ized Phase III study .
in one study , 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion of more than 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi @-@ center study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , which received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 compared to an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion with no pre @-@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had previously received chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for metastatic and 19 % for metastatic disease and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The outcomes for the overall response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First Line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement by one degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy degree 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to sound bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was measured in clinical trials .
exposure to active substances ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36@@ n@@ g.@@ h / ml , an@@ alog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 Ac@@ cor@@ ding to the intraven@@ ous dose of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the plasma concentration of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el decreased in a multi@@ phase way .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vas@@ cul@@ arity of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with patients with advanced solid tumours , Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el &apos;s pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical properties were compared with an intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values following a 3 hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the clearance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane injection ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
published literature on in vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , the mean value for the cum@@ ulative flow of active substances was 4 % of the total metabol@@ ite 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , suggest@@ ing a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearing .
however , only a few data is available about patients at the age of more than 75 years , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and in light of light over 8 hours .
Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ carcin@@ ogen@@ ic medicine and , as with other potentially toxic substances , caution should be observed when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active substance ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference drug &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in patients with normal blood vessels , which could occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications , if a blood donation is not possible prior to the procedure and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in treating patients with illnesses for which the medicine is shown .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein .
the injection can also be done by the patient or his supervis@@ or , provided they have received appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be checked before the treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency and iron supplements should be given during the entire treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin deficiency or by the fact that the body does not adequately address the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus to reduce the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which it em@@ powers to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with the reference drug used as an injection into a vein as part of a major study involving 4@@ 79 patients who suffered from kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study were inj@@ ected at least eight weeks E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a vein before they either amed down or retained E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the change in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the start of the study and the evaluation period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of stre@@ amed down under the skin were studied with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients who suffered from kidney problems , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in levels of patients who were treated to Ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained to the same extent as in those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ elling mig@@ raine @-@ like head@@ aches and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed must not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components .
un@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed in accordance with the European Union regulations , evidence was provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that has amed Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for medical professionals across all member states , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Medi@@ c Drug P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG for the marketing of Ab@@ se@@ amed across the European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion requirements in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multiple my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre@@ existing an@@ a@@ emia at the onset of chemotherapy ) .
the treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in the case of planned larger operations which require large blood volume ( 4 or more units of blood for women ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used to reduce external blood loss before major elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic intervention in adults with no iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications can be expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml can be applied that cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ atric patients where hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms and tor@@ tures may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the physician .
an increase in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in a patient above or below the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration .
in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest permitted dose required to control an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
the clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
these clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
start dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms of an@@ emia and - follow @-@ up may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the physician .
in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied at the lowest permitted dose required for control of the an@@ emia symptoms .
if after 4 weeks of treatment the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number by ≥ 40.000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the bas@@ eline value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number of &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l is increased compared to the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is increased by ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number by ≥ 40.000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , a response to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be abor@@ ted .
patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , which require the precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood vessels , should be protected twice a week for 3 weeks before surgical procedure at a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg of body weight .
iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program commen@@ ces so that large iron reserves are available before the beginning of the se@@ amed treatment .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of engagement ( day 0 ) .
in this case , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg on 10 consecutive days , on the day of the surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis can be given via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient inj@@ ections of the medicine into circulation .
patients diagnosed with any ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin at an ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ie ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pol@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not be released or another ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ie ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month prior to treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous rom@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. ven@@ ous ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ lies ) .
the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , accompanying or basic diseases : severe cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , peripheral vascular disease , vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with a recently occurred heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely reported about the appearance of an anti @-@ body @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of activity , defined as reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the re@@ tic@@ ence value should be determined and the usual causes for failure ( fo@@ lic acid , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umin@@ escence , infection or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) should be investigated .
if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ ti@@ u@@ loc@@ yte &quot; Index &quot; ) , is lower ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / Micro@@ liter or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row for diagnosis of a PR@@ CA should be considered .
data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of an anti @-@ body induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration recommended under Section 4.2 should not be exceeded .
in clinical trials an increased risk of mortality and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed if ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit , which is due to the gift of epo@@ et@@ ines when the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration needed to control angi@@ ogen@@ ic symptoms and avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration recommended under Section 4.2 should not be exceeded .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of the ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
for tumour patients under chemotherapy , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response should be considered for the assessment of the therapeutic efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ( patients who need to be trans@@ acted ) .
if the H@@ b increase exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see Section 4.2 ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients fores@@ een for greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated appropriately before the onset of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy .
patients undergoing major elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive adequate thro@@ mb@@ os@@ e@@ pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially for underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be ruled out that treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa could be an increased risk of postoperative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events for patients with an output level of &gt; 13 g / dl .
in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or decrease the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , if hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration was targeted at 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l )
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ dose should be adapted to the increasing ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
in vitro studies of tumor tissues no evidence indicates an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F with regard to hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
about th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , cereb@@ ral inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , trans@@ itory th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , retinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , an@@ eur@@ y@@ sm@@ s , retinal thro@@ mb@@ oses and 11 blood cl@@ ots were reported in patients with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the wor@@ sen@@ ing of an existing hypertension .
increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine treatment .
regardless of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , surgical patients with a cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations can lead to th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications .
the genetic engineering epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ fied and is identical with the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ a@@ mic patients with respect to the amino acids and the carbohydr@@ ate portion .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .
3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ oma , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ dg@@ kin@@ ome lymph@@ oma and 24 other hem@@ o@@ bla@@ sts ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tumours ( 172 breast carcin@@ omas , 64 malign@@ ant carcin@@ omas , 22 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas and 30 others ) .
1895 patients with solid tumours ( 6@@ 83 breast carcin@@ omas , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 17@@ 4 gy@@ na@@ ecological tumours , 300 gastro@@ intestinal tum@@ ors and 4@@ 78 other ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in .
survival and tumour progression were studied in five large controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin showed an untreated , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality rate than in the controls due to several pre@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis and associated complications associated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ism in tumor patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of at@@ taining a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa provisions after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly prolonged half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa &apos;s serum levels are much lower than serum levels , which are achieved after intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no accumulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
( bone mar@@ ital fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated three years with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ) .
14 In animal experimental studies with approximately 20 times the recommended daily dose of the recommended daily dose epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to reduced fat body weight , a delay in the os@@ si@@ fication and an increase in the fet@@ al mortality .

• If you suffer from a heart attack or stroke in a month prior to your treatment , if you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time occ@@ uring or increased chest pain ) , there is a risk of blood cl@@ ots in the veins ( deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ) .
they suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral vascular disease ) , the cervi@@ cal vessels ( vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) have recently suffered a heart attack or stroke .
during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , there can be a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets within the normal range , which re@@ forms with further treatment .
if necessary , your doctor will perform regular blood tests to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
lack of iron , dis@@ solving of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be considered and treated with Ab@@ se@@ amed prior to treatment .
very rare was reported about the occurrence of an anti@@ cancer @-@ medi@@ ated ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( inj@@ ected ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sting , it will break down your therapy with ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , secre@@ tions must be given by injection into a vein ( IV ) if you are treated for an an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value could be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in case of increased or rising potassium levels , your doctor may consider an interruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels fall back in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically open cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or di@@ gest@@ ed signs by insufficient heart performance , your doctor will make sure that your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value .
according to the present findings , the treatment of the blood @-@ arm with ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of the ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and the desired effect should be considered for ass@@ essing the efficacy of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your values of red blood color@@ ant ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your sever@@ ity dose to keep the risk of blood cl@@ ots ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , particularly if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( adi@@ p@@ por@@ ous ) or if there have been th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events in the past ( e.g. a deep ven@@ ous rom@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bol@@ ism ) .
in case you &apos;re a cancer patient , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed is a growth factor for blood cells and may have a negative impact on the tumour .
if you are undergoing a major orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , before the start of treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
if your values of red blood cells ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get rid of Ab@@ se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of blood cl@@ ots after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is a non @-@ prescription medication .
if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may need to arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory studies have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are agents to build up the immune system , e.g. for cancer chemotherapy or for HIV ) .
depending on your an@@ emia , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor may , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to check the success of the treatment and make sure that the medicine works properly and that your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well set , you will receive regular doses of se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , distributed over two equally large inj@@ ections .
your doctor may , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to check the success of the treatment and make sure that your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how an@@ a@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control .
in order to ensure this and to ensure that the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending physician will perform regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of the intervention and another 4 days after the surgery .
however , if your doctor considers this appropriate , you can also learn how to inj@@ ure Ab@@ se@@ amed yourself under the skin .
heart , heart attacks , cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges , strokes , temporary circul@@ atory disorders of the brain , deep ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , vascular oc@@ clu@@ sions ( an@@ eur@@ y@@ sm@@ s ) , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis of the retina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients with ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
ey@@ eli@@ ds and lips ( qu@@ in@@ ted o@@ ede@@ ma ) and sho@@ cking allergic reactions with symptoms such as ting@@ ling , redness , it@@ ching , heat feeling and accelerated pulse have been reported in rare cases .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia means that no longer sufficient red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Speci@@ fic caution when using Ab@@ se@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations , it can - regardless of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed - come to a blood c@@ dro@@ pl@@ ating ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed can be associated with an increased risk of blood sample formation after surgery ( post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) if your output level is too high .

ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes bones rup@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including in patients who have recently suffered a trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture as in the case of chi@@ ef@@ all ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; before the first in@@ fusion patients should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 12@@ 5,000 IE ) or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches in the three days after in@@ fusion .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta must be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
since the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in the first study , nearly 8 000 elderly women were involved in oste@@ opor@@ osis and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was studied over a period of three years .
the second study comprised 2@@ 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was studied over a period of up to five years .
in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies on a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study involving older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis medicines ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to placebo .
the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % compared to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis medicines ) .
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of the side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ la@@ sta may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion and oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( loss of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta manufacturer provides information for doctors who prescri@@ be ac@@ la@@ sta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains information about how the medicine is used and similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited an approval for Ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s placing on the market across the European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year .
patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic ac@@ etab@@ ular frac@@ ture are recommended to use the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
following a treatment of the Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient calcium intake in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get twice daily for at least 500@@ mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by means of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with kidney function disorder ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended as limited clinical experience exists for this group of patients .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents Ac@@ la@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age , as data on harm@@ lessness and efficacy is missing .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , since only limited clinical experience exists for this patient population .
prior to the onset of treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , pre@@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated by adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the quick insertion of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia develops , whose maximum occurs normally within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient calcium intake in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get twice daily for at least 500 m@@ g. of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the Ac@@ la@@ sta gift ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene ) should be considered with appropriate preventive denti@@ stry prior to the use of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
there are no data available for patients who need dental procedures , whether the interruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis in the jaw region .
the clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
the frequency of cases of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation reported as serious adverse events was increased in patients receiving Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug interactions are listed in Table 1 .
ren@@ al dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ics was associated with ren@@ al dys@@ functions associated with decrease of the ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ atine ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a restricted ren@@ al function were in a clinical trial for oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years compared to the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ atine within 10 days of therapy was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium levels below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study , in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently l@@ itt@@ led hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D mirrors were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions following the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in a large clinical study were reported on local reactions at the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the max@@ il@@ lo@@ facial area has been reported , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental interventions .
7 patients with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients treated oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area with ac@@ la@@ sta and placebo @-@ treated patients .
in the case of over@@ dosing , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation of oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate can be achieved .
clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ S@@ core for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ eck ≤ -@@ 1.5 and at least two mild or a moderate @-@ heavy existing spine frac@@ ture or a BM@@ D T @-@ S@@ core for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ eck ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spine frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ omet@@ rical verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures were significantly lowered over a period of three years and the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures after a year ( see table 2 ) .
ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on ac@@ la@@ sta hip frac@@ tures yiel@@ ded an equally lasting effect over three years , which resulted in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased bone density at lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ c acid , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment at all time points ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the whole th@@ igh by 6.@@ 0 % , the lower th@@ igh by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
in 152 Post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , a year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es from the pel@@ vis .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta compared to placebo an increase in tra@@ be@@ cular bone volume and the preservation of tra@@ be@@ cular bone architecture .
bone replacement markers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in periods of study duration .
the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Ac@@ la@@ sta significantly reduced B@@ SAP by 30 % compared to bas@@ eline and was kept at 28 % below the bas@@ eline value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the bas@@ eline value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the bas@@ eline value of up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the bas@@ eline after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the bas@@ eline value up to 36 months .
vitamin D levels were not measured rout@@ inely , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5.000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks prior to in@@ fusion .
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , the BM@@ D increased the BM@@ D at all time points compared to placebo treatment .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % compared to placebo treatment by 5.@@ 4 % compared to placebo .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in men &apos;s clinical frac@@ tures ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once annual dose of Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to the once weekly dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was not inferior to the percentage change in lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to bas@@ eline .
clinical effectiveness of the treatment at the Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta has been studied in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , mainly light to moder@@ ately difficult Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2,@@ 6@@ x to 3,@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper average for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day for 2 months was demonstrated in two six months comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain and pain intensity was observed after 6 months compared to the bas@@ eline for ac@@ la@@ sta and ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ si@@ bilities at the end of the six month trial could be included in an observ@@ ational phase .
of the 143 patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta and the 107 patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic approach of 141 patients with ac@@ la@@ sta , compared to 71 patients treated with Ris@@ edi@@ pus , could be maintained at an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minute in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron fo@@ lic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical data which proved to be dos@@ is@@ independent .
thereafter , the plasma level quickly increased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic removal from the large cycle with half @-@ life t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimination period with a terminal elimination period t ½ g 146 hours .
the early phases of distribution ( α and β , with the above 1 ½ -@@ values ) presumably represent the rapid absorption into the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue .
the total body @-@ clear@@ ance amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration at time ) .
a dimin@@ ished clearance of met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed substances by Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzymes is unlikely , because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , substance @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearance of the ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron @-@ acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance , and in the 64 examined patients in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al dysfunction down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing up to 35 ml / min no dosage adjustment of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid required .
because there is only limited data for severe kidney function disorder ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest single @-@ acting intraven@@ ous single dose in mice amounted to 10 mg / kg of body weight and at rats 0,@@ 6 mg / kg of body weight .
in the case of studies in dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the 6@@ fold of recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) were administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence .
chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity in trials involving intraven@@ ous application was given the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in rats , taking doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , ranging in intervals of 2- 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose corresponding to the 7@@ x of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , related to the AU@@ C , ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated application for cum@@ ulative expos@@ ures exceeding the maximum of planned human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects on other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , and the intraven@@ ous injection point , occurred .
the most frequent finding in trials with repeated use was an increased primary spontan@@ eity in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , an inf@@ estation that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
rats observed ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity at dos@@ ages of 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such a skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of low serum calcium levels .
if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; usually 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .

Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ics is a representative of a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the disease Pa@@ get of the bone .
declining blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens that are formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
at the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , the bone structure is too fast , and new bone material is in@@ subordin@@ ate , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
ac@@ la@@ sta works by normal@@ ising bone structure , guaranteeing a normal bone formation and thus giving the bone strength again .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo dental surgery , tell your doctor that you will be treated with ac@@ la@@ sta .
if you use Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / used it , even if it is a non @-@ prescription medication .
for your doctor it is particularly important to know if you are taking medicines that are known to damage the kidneys .
when applying Ac@@ la@@ sta together with food and drink , you are concerned that you take sufficient fluids according to your doctor &apos;s instructions before and after treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a vein .
if you have recently frac@@ tured the hip , it is recommended to admini@@ ster Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg given to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a vein .
since Ac@@ la@@ sta works for a long time , you may need to take another dose only after a year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions closely so that the calcium level in your blood will not be too low during the time after in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can work for more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need another treatment .
if the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta has been missed , please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before termination of treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta If you are considering termination of treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please consult your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss it with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion occur very often ( in more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent after subsequent in@@ fusion .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
currently it is unclear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms in yourself after you have received Ac@@ la@@ sta .

about allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , was reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if one of the listed side effects is significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not listed in this information .
if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for storage time and conditions until application ; usually 24 hours at 2 ° C up to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .
patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic , low @-@ trau@@ matic frac@@ ture are recommended to use the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta patients must be adequately supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
due to the quick insertion of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic @-@ running hypo@@ kal@@ emia develops , whose maximum occurs normally within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient calcium intake in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic ac@@ up@@ un@@ cture an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .

A@@ comp@@ lia is additionally applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients who suffer from obesity ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or • which are overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and additionally one or more I
in addition , four studies were conducted to more than 7 000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive drug for setting smoking compared to placebo .
the studies on setting smoking showed no uniform results , so the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia on this area of application was difficult to assess .
what risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? it is the most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia that were observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) , nausea and infections of upper respiratory tract .
it may also not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or be treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants as it can increase the risk of depression and , among other things , may provoke a small minority of su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts .
caution is advised while applying ag@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for using HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , t@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .

A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and young people under the age of 18 due to the lack of data for effectiveness and harm@@ lessness .
depression or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported in up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the benefit of treatment in the individual case predomin@@ ates the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
even in patients who - besides obesity - have no recognis@@ able risks , de@@ pressed reactions can occur .

if Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the mat@@ ing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , no unwanted effects on the fertility or menstru@@ al disturbances were observed .
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was investigated at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , an exposure with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and via lac@@ tation didn &apos;t cause any changes in learning behavior or memory .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the studies conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medication ) is not indicated .
met@@ form@@ in can also be used in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) who cannot be adequately configured with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ in or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin can be maintained with the onset of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , making type 2 diabetes better .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was studied ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , in addition they received either ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were reduced in the application of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg doses .
at the end of the trial study , the effect of an additional dose of Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ in decreased by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional dose of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study investigating the combination of ac@@ tos and insulin in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin had a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in the patients who received additional placebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ th@@ aes@@ thesia ( decreased sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos can neither be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - acid levels - in blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited an approval for Ac@@ tos &quot; placing in the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the mark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the wording &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and where met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
for the use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. early heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular outcome study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients less than 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced advanced mac@@ ular disease was performed .
in this study there was an increase in reports of heart failure , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver enz@@ ym@@ atic values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range , the liver enzyme levels are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that point to a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction such as un@@ resolved nausea , vom@@ iting , abdominal pain , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , liver enzyme levels are to be checked .
the decision whether to continue the treatment of patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be guided by clinical assessment until the laboratory parameters have been passed .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven that can stem from fatty deposits and in some cases is associated with fluid retention .
as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , minor hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under the therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
similar changes were observed in comparative studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 3.1 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity in patients receiving pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral secondary or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ in or as two @-@ cell combination therapy with insulin , the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
after the market launch a reduction of visual acuity was reported under the treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ de indi@@ a , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , an incidence or wor@@ sen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma .
it is not clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma . however , prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma if patients report disorders of visual acuity ; an appropriate ophthalm@@ ological evaluation should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3,5 years of study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1,0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one were compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is to be dismissed ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on the interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not have any relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ ine , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors cannot be expected .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal are reduced and the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for the fet@@ al growth is reduced .
very often &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , individual cases : unknown ( not estim@@ able from this data ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and the refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T asc@@ ents exceeding three times the upper limit of the normal range were equally common as placebo , but less often than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl resin .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with advanced advanced mac@@ ular vascular disease , the incidence of severe heart failure under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than placebo , when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one respectively .
since the market launch has rarely been reported about cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , however , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of reports of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients were performed in the groups treated with comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , which lasted over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days did not appear any symptoms .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to have an activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator @-@ activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) , which in the animal model leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be demonstrated that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose rating in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ enti@@ dal as mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time of two years after the onset of the therapy , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) could be maintained by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in 69 % of treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ enti@@ cide ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was inadequate despite a three @-@ month optimization phase were random@@ ized to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients suffering from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c decreased by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who still received only insulin ; a reduction of insulin dosage in the treated group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one consistently showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ent compared to the initial values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diabetes patients .
in most clinical studies , compared to placebo , a reduction in overall plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as slight , but clin@@ ically not significantly elevated LD@@ L cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the total poly@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or bile , and increased HD@@ L cholesterol levels .
compared to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , while values decreased in met@@ form@@ in and co@@ lic acid .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the in@@ timi@@ dity tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ erior elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , which has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced advanced mac@@ ular vascular disease were random@@ ized to groups who received either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , with the peak concentrations of imm@@ utable pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in the plasma usually 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to efficacy is equivalent to three times the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies it was proven that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not have a relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ ine , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral use of radio@@ actively marked Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in rot@@ ting ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma @-@ elimination period of unchanged pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans and the total active metabol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced ren@@ al function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of the oral clear@@ ances of the mother substance are similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies mice , rats , dogs and monkeys conver@@ ged with repeated administration of plasma volume increase with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and reversible , ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal are reduced and the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for the fet@@ al growth is reduced .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) of the bladder epitheli@@ um were induced in rats .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ de indi@@ ons led to increased frequency of col@@ on tum@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and apply on one side the mark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the wording &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3,5 years of study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1,0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one were compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
in another study more than two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ lac@@ tate were investigated .
in clinical trials more than 1 year , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one consistently showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ent compared to the initial values .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the in@@ timi@@ dity tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ erior elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , which has an effect on tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption as well as h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ lic@@ eri@@ des synthesis .
although the study missed the target of their primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ mortal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , cor@@ on@@ ary vas@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and vas@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that there are no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks associated with taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .

Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane has been studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes where the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane resulted in a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels were reduced similarly to another human@@ ising insulin .
ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane may be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( see the complete list of packages ) .
the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane were predomin@@ ant in the treatment of diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the marketing of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane in the European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily if a rapid initial action combined with a longer lasting effect is desired .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the whole dose is inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar levels have improved significantly , for example , have significantly improved the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long acting insulin etc . ) , insulin type ( animal insulin , insulin or insulin analog ) and / or production method ( due to re@@ combin@@ ant DNA against insulin in animal origin ) can cause a change in dosage to be required .
if a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions after a change of animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different from previous insulin .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore take into account possible interactions in the therapy and always ask his patients to consult other medicines taken from them .
4 B@@ oth hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which can occur in a non @-@ controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fru@@ ct@@ ose in uter@@ o .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia may lead to loss of consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and end with temporary or permanent dys@@ functions of brain function and even death .
diseases of the nervous system Occ@@ a@@ sional - Periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with complaints which are referred to as acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are usually reversible .
5 An intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement in blood sugar levels can , however , be associated with a temporary deterioration of diabe@@ tic retin@@ opathy .
diseases of the skin and the sub@@ cut@@ aneous tissue Ac@@ tu@@ ally - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy At the injection site a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy may occur if missed to change the in@@ stit@@ ches within the injection range .
general illnesses and complaints at the administration site Occ@@ a@@ sional - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions at the injection site Dur@@ ing the insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma occur at the injection site ) can occur .
diseases of the immune system Occ@@ a@@ sional - Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Ex@@ an@@ them Very rarely - an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions Symp@@ toms of gener@@ alized hyper@@ sensitivity , including gener@@ alized rash , it@@ ching , per@@ spir@@ ation , gastro@@ intestinal disturbances , angi@@ onic ede@@ ma , breathing difficulties , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , low blood pressure and fain@@ ting / un@@ consciousness .
hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can , however , be gradually developed : • Light hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar@@ s , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Heavy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven auxiliary person or by glucose , which is administered intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire activity duration is up to 24 hours .
the res@@ or@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of fis@@ sion ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) locations on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the division are active .
based on conventional studies on safety mac@@ rop@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated dosing , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot identify any particular dangers to humans .

ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id should not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id must be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the launch of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin quickly acting must first be raised , then the amount of long acting insulin .
3 If a dose adjustment is required when switching to acet@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
5 General diseases and complaints at the administration site Occ@@ a@@ sional - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions at the injection site Dur@@ ing insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma occur at the injection site ) can occur .

a clinical study in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients , who underwent major surgical procedures , reduced mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs. 4.6 % ) .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the entire effect lasts approximately 7 to 8 hours .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and adolescents ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data is limited but suggests that pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients showing signs of de@@ br@@ is , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or arthritis no@@ des ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger urine cryst@@ alli@@ zation that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
g@@ out attacks may still occur during the first months of treatment ; this is why it is recommended that the patients continue to use further medicines for preventing rheum@@ atic sei@@ zur@@ es at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic .
the medicine is not recommended for children and for patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study , where 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the placebo ( placebo ) and al@@ loc@@ cul@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared with al@@ loc@@ cul@@ in@@ ol in 7@@ 62 patients each year .
in both studies , al@@ loc@@ cul@@ in@@ ol was used at a dose of once a day 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients whose levels of ur@@ ic acid lay in the blood for the last three measurements under 6 mg / dl .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients receiving aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once a day were 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients receiving 120 mg once a day , in the last three measurements a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
especially in patients with heart problems in pre @-@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and the blood vessels .
the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side @-@ effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to initial deposits ( including a tox@@ in known from the history of the disease and / or arthritis ) .
if the serum fer@@ ric acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken into consideration on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x a day .
in patients with severe ren@@ al function , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated until now ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
since there is no experience in children and adolescents , the application of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients .
since there are no experiences in organ transplan@@ t recipients , the application of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular diseases In patients with isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure , treatment with f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other medicines , it may lead to acute g@@ out in the course of the treatment , because the reduction of the serum resin table can initially mobili@@ ze ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissue .
B. with malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in urine is so widespread in rare cases that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease Dur@@ ing phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of the liver function were observed in patients treated with f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform liver function tests before starting the f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ar treatment and in the following course depending on clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine Z@@ was conducted no interaction studies on F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O @-@ in@@ hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ ll level ( an in@@ hibition of metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
subjects were the simultaneous injection of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ar exposure ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adjustment for f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient required at the same time .
in a study involving subjects 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x a mean 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , suggest@@ ing a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vivo .
ant@@ acids It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acid , which contains magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , delays the absorption of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and causes a decrease of C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C .
pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies can not be concluded on the side effects of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal @-@ experimental studies do not include direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be cau@@ tious when driving a vehicle , operating machinery or performing hazardous activities until they can be reasonably sure that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events was observed in the total f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extension studies ( 1,4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al relationship with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
risk factors determined in these patients were arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects that could occur in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and were reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once were listed below .
diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In clinical trials there were no severe skin rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions .
7 Open long @-@ term extension studies in open long @-@ term extension studies were treated 9@@ 06 patients up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the treatment @-@ related events reported during long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients receiving F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the information occasionally .

clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly serum levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

lowering the serum resin table to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and permanently maintained over the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ loc@@ cul@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum incre@@ ment values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al function The AP@@ EX @-@ study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with ren@@ al function restriction ( d. h .
AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was the primary efficacy end@@ point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage decline of the serum concentration in subjects , despite their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum har@@ n@@ acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum resin concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study ( bas@@ eline ) .
the data collected in two years of the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the persistent reduction of the serum resin @-@ acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of g@@ out attacks , so that less than 3 % of patients needed no treatment against a g@@ out ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients needed no treatment ) .
this was associated with a reduction of the g@@ ory node size , which resulted in 54 % of the patients a complete disappearance of the pla@@ iting lymp@@ h no@@ des by month 24 .
increased TS@@ H values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients receiving al@@ loc@@ cul@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the area under the plasma concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at followed by administration of simple and multiple doses ranging from 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase of AU@@ C is observed for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x a day , the C@@ max amounts to approximately 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage decline in the serum concentration of serum was observed if this was checked ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent steady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma protein binding of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration range obtained with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ s showed that these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are mainly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id arises princip@@ ally by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked bas@@ eline , approximately 49 % of the dose in the urine was found as imm@@ utable F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose was found in the chair as an unchanged f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ max of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to subjects with normal ren@@ al function .
the mean total @-@ AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased approximately 1.8 @-@ times of 7.5 μ g / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function at 13.@@ 2 μ g / ml in the group with severe kidney function .

these findings are seen as a result of a special Pur@@ in@@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zation and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it has been found that in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day , F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on the fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
at high doses , which were about 4.3 @-@ times of human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred , accompanied by a reduction in the performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease where the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause , where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no bot@@ tled water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irritation of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in medicines that are approved in the European Union , the company presented data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those with only al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data suggest@@ ing that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal pain ( muscle , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( intestinal disorders ) , flu@@ ency ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) of o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia ( swal@@ lowing disorders ) , blo@@ ated abdom@@ en ( b@@ lower abdom@@ en ) and aci@@ dic sho@@ cks .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other components AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be applied .
it must not be used in diseases of o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium level ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission granted Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ a Ltd approval for the transport of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE across the European Union .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only to be taken with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following hints are to be observed exactly to reduce the risk of o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should only be swal@@ lowed with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or cr@@ ush the tablet in the mouth as there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • Pati@@ ents should not lie ahead of the first intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract , except p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , be given only with special care ( see section 4.3 ) .
o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al strokes , were reported in patients receiving al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partially these were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate potential es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be pointed out when symptoms of op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation like dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ active pain or new or worse heart@@ burn the medicine and seek medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be higher in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or continue taking it after the occurrence of symptoms that point to an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation .
it is very important that all dosing instructions be passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was detected , stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cers , including some severe and with complications , were rarely reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy regi@@ mens were predominantly administered intraven@@ ously containing bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
there are no data available which indicate whether the use of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients need@@ ing a surgical procedure reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician is decisive for the treatment planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that they should take the tablet the next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after they have noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet per week as originally planned on the day of the week .
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated adequately before starting treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time .
therefore , after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions occ@@ ured .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or by nursing women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports originate from cancer patients , but also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
nevertheless , the ser@@ um @-@ cal@@ ci@@ um decreases to &lt; 8.@@ 0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate In@@ sight of an oral over@@ dose may occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ tures in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two Phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ ture intervention trial ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in phase III studies , the mean asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % on the fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % at the Tro@@ chan@@ ter .
in the group treated with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 3.2 % vs placebo 6.1 % ) was achieved in the group treated with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of the spine and the Tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to stop ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was also maintained .
fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled studies where al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 m@@ g. daily over 2 years and thereafter 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new ed@@ dy fraction by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 7.@@ 9 % vs placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
res@@ or@@ ption : the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women was 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after night fasting and two hours before starting a standardised breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to approximately 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken one or half an hour before a standardised breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drinking of the day .
in healthy volunteers , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically meaningful change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 Distribution studies in rats have shown that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily distributed in soft tissue after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly disper@@ sed into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine .
expul@@ sion After IV dosing of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate about 50 % of the radio@@ actively selected substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the rot@@ ten@@ ce .
following intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was 71 ml / min and systemic clear@@ ances did not exceed 200 ml / min .
in rats , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs is influenced by these transport systems in humans .

ex@@ cre@@ tion In the absence of radio@@ actively marked vitamin D@@ 3 in healthy volunteers , the average ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine was 2.4 % in the urine after 4 days , 4.@@ 9 % .
characteristics in patients with prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not deposited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via the urine .
although no clinical data is available , it is expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as well as in animal experiments will also be reduced in patients with reduced ren@@ al function .
for this reason , in patients with reduced ren@@ al function , a somewhat higher accumulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in the bone is to be expected ( see section 4.2 ) .

adv@@ agra@@ f is given to adult patients having a kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent transplan@@ ted organ rejection by the immune system .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical study were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ t , comparing Adv@@ an@@ agra@@ f with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients in which the gra@@ ft was rep@@ elled after a treatment duration of one year ( for example , by examining how often a new organ transplan@@ t or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , shorter follow @-@ up studies were conducted on 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t and examined how adv@@ agra@@ ph is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other components , adv@@ agra@@ f may not be applied .
patients and doctors must be cau@@ tious if others ( especially some herbal ) medicines should be taken with adv@@ agra@@ f at the same time as the adv@@ agra@@ ph dose or dose of the medication taken at the same time needs to be adapted accordingly .
hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded yellow @-@ orange gel@@ atine capsules , printed in red ink on the pale yellow capsule section with &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; and on the orange cap@@ s@@ ular bottom with &quot; 50@@ 6@@ 47 &quot; ; they contain white powder .
only physicians who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this may lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; changes of the formulation or regime should only be performed under close supervision of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of a change@@ over to an alternative formulation , therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
the dosage of Adv@@ an@@ agra@@ f should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood level provisions ( see &quot; Recommen@@ dations &quot; ) .
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ an@@ f , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus level mirrors should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion .
on day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a level mirror , was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated controls of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus level are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation in advance to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate re @-@ transplan@@ t phase .
because tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a low @-@ leg@@ ged substance , an adjustment of the dose can take several days until the steady state is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition in the first postoperative period does not allow oral ing@@ es@@ tion of medicines , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be initiated intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion fluid ) with a dose of ca .
duration of the application For suppression of gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dosage recommendations - ren@@ al transplantation Pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral Adv@@ an@@ agra@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
further dosage adjustment can be required later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of the patient &apos;s stabil@@ isation following the transplan@@ t .
dose recommendations - liver transplan@@ t Pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral Adv@@ an@@ agra@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ an@@ f must be changed a transplan@@ t recipient of twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of adv@@ agra@@ f , so this conversion has to take place in proportion 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the total daily dose .
ren@@ al and liver transplantation After switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to adv@@ agra@@ f once a day , the treatment with the recommended oral initial dose for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection must begin once a day .
heart transplan@@ t In adult patients who are transplan@@ ted to adv@@ agra@@ ph , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is to be taken once a day .
other transplan@@ t recipients , although there is no clinical experience with Adv@@ ant@@ ages in lung , pancre@@ atic and ec@@ tal transplan@@ t patients , occurred in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in intestinal transplan@@ t recipients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function For the maintenance of blood levels in the targeted area , a reduction of the dose may be required in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions .
patients with reduced ren@@ al function Sin@@ ce the ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , a careful supervision of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of serum incre@@ ment levels , a calculation of the cre@@ atine in the urine and a monitoring of the urine volume ) is recommended .
change@@ over from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ an@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy caution is required ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases , with the aid of thorou@@ gh@@ bred Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ king @-@ controls .
it is recommended to carry out frequent checks of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus level levels during the first two weeks after transplantation , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .
blood seb@@ ac@@ eous levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be checked after conversion from pro@@ gra@@ f to adv@@ agra@@ f , dose adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant therapy or , at the same time , application of substances that could alter the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus full blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
as Adv@@ an@@ f is a low @-@ leg@@ ged drug , adjustments to the dose may require several days until the steady state has occurred .
clinical studies indicate that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , in the first period of the liver transplan@@ tations , tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ gs are usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects caused by tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under@@ - or over @-@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; changes of the formulation or regime should only be performed under close supervision of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be refrac@@ tory contrary to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are still no clinical data for the retard@@ ated Adv@@ ant@@ f formulation .
in order to pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and transplan@@ t recipients , no clinical data are available for the retard@@ ated Adv@@ an@@ agra@@ f formulation .
due to possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus level in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other plant remedies during a treatment with adv@@ agra@@ ph ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful supervision of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is required , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to considerable variations in such circumstances .
in rare cases , v@@ entri@@ c or sep@@ tic hyper@@ tro@@ phy , known as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy , was observed in Pro@@ gra@@ f , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ an@@ agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the possible risk of mal@@ ig@@ ent skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a sun protection agent with a high protection factor .
if patients who take tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and visual disturbances , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
as Adv@@ an@@ f hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded , lac@@ tose contained , special caution is required in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and therefore increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels while adding substances that can alter the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A &apos;s metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dosage for maintaining uniform concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly pronounced interaction with an@@ tim@@ y@@ k@@ oti@@ ka such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the macro@@ li@@ de antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z .
Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in case of acute rejection reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other drugs Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors ; therefore , the simultaneous application of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect their metabolism .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid @-@ contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase the hormone level , decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures must be particularly careful .
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially reduce the Clear@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and pro@@ long their half @-@ life time .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients do not provide evidence that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and result of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , supervision of the new@@ born is recommended for possible damaging effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and hyper@@ escal@@ ation of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants can often not be determined precisely because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a large number of other medicines .
in the following , the side effects after their frequency are listed in descending order : very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10.000 , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) .

infection and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases As well known in other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , patients who are treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are often increased suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , proto@@ zo@@ al ) .
cases of the BK @-@ Virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy , including treatment with Adv@@ an@@ agra@@ f .
ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tumours were reported in connection with the treatment with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins , tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus cannot be di@@ aly@@ zed .
mechanisms of action and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects At the molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are likely to be medi@@ ated by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cell inn@@ ner .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell , preventing the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tic genes .
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus op@@ presses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , and the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cytes ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

published results of the primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the form of twice daily pro@@ gra@@ f capsules after other primary organ transplan@@ tations Pro@@ gra@@ f has evolved into a recognised primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after pancre@@ atic , lung and intestinal transplan@@ ts .
in 6@@ 30 cases , patients who had undergone a pancre@@ atic transplantation were treated as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant in 6@@ 30 cases .
overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f was consistent with these published studies in the studies in which pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients .
lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multi @-@ center study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f , more than 110 patients were reported to receive either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in within a 1 : 1 random@@ isation .
chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis ob@@ liter@@ ans@@ - syndrome was less frequent in the first year after transplantation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract # 22 ) .
patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus were found in 21.@@ 7 % of cases of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were killed by tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which no acute gra@@ ft rejection occurred was increased after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus patients ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study the frequency of developing a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis ob@@ liter@@ ans@@ - syn@@ dro@@ ms was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
pancre@@ atic transplantation A multi@@ center study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was performed in 205 patients undergoing pancre@@ atic and ren@@ al transplantation based on a random@@ ised procedure tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then achieved to achieve the desired level of 8 to 15 ng / ml am 5 .
the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after intestinal gra@@ fts showed an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .
methods for early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ row enlargement , additional gift of inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 antagon@@ ist d@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , lower initial doses of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , which lead to levels of reflection between 10 and 15 ng / ml and recently gra@@ ft survival ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , An@@ n Sur@@ g 2001 ; 2@@ 34 : 40@@ 4 ) .
factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ bound group of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or a strengthening of metabolism brought about by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for the higher clear@@ ances observed after the transplan@@ t .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly occurs over the bile .
the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ an@@ age was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f in the case of stable patients undergoing pro@@ gra@@ f ( once daily ) in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) in relation to the total daily dose .
it is recommended to carry out frequent checks of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus level levels during the first two weeks after transplantation , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .
21 For the treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ t rejection , which proved to be refrac@@ tory contrary to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are still no clinical data for the retard@@ ated Adv@@ ant@@ f formulation .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma .
28 confirmed acute rejection was 3@@ 2.6 % within the first 24 weeks of the advance group ( N = 2@@ 37 ) and 29.@@ 3 % in the pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) .

adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether adv@@ ate is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ots such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but produced according to a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which it em@@ powers to the formation of the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II .
adv@@ ate is similar to another drug approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently so that the medicine does not contain proteins or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study involving 53 children less than six years , the use of the medicine was investigated for the prevention of bleeding and for surgical procedures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the main study , the efficacy of adv@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new bleeding sep@@ als was rated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common side effects of adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II .
adv@@ ate must not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG for the transport of lawyers across the European Union .
dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VI@@ II @-@ lack , the location and extent of the bleeding and the patient &apos;s clinical condition .
in the following ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events factor VI@@ II activity is not to fall below the indicated plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) during the corresponding period of time .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute depression are removed .
repeat the injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk is over for the patient .
during the treatment course , appropriate determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma levels is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of the inj@@ ections .
individual patients may differ in their response to factor VI@@ II , achieve different in vivo recovery and have different half @-@ times .
3 Pro@@ phyla@@ xis For long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg of body weight should be given within 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II @-@ plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be carried out in order to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the Factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures must be considered .
the rate of administration should be based on the patient &apos;s desire and a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in treating patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II @-@ directed Ig@@ G immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma with modified Be@@ thes@@ da as@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to Factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is the greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure times and an am@@ nes@@ tically known inhibit@@ or development , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant Factor VI@@ II product to another , the re @-@ emergence of ( low @-@ tide ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women no experience exists about the use of Factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s , which occur in the largest number of patients , were inhibit@@ ors of factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , which showed a higher risk of the formation of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ gel occurred postoperative ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - mirrors in the plasma and the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values on 15 postoperative day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed heavy to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) after 26 exposure days .
in addition , in none of the 53 pedi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed heavy to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) , a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or was detected by prior exposure to factor VI@@ II concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) .
previously untreated patients of a ongoing clinical trial comprised 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) patients treated with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II .
the patient &apos;s immune response to trace of contaminated proteins was analyzed by examining the antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend and a sustained peak of the antibody level versus anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms that had an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
four patients were informed about the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es gran@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes in multiple repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E reported hyper@@ sensitivity reactions from the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the activated factor VI@@ II acts as a factor factor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were performed in pre@@ treated patients with severe or moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( bas@@ eline factor of factor VI@@ II @-@ activity ≤ 2 % ) .

based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP has still considered the benefit risk assessment as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , based on the A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E security profile , which necess@@ it@@ ates a filing of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , the CH@@ MP has decided to apply for further renewal procedures in 5 years .
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited announced the approval of the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) to withdraw its application for the treatment of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer .
usually , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissues that link and support other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has been modified in such a way that it cannot produce copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable cancer cells to re @-@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 @-@ protein produced from the p@@ 53 gene that is not defective in the human body normally contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be restored .
in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , where the p@@ 53 @-@ gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide .
the company presented data from a study with a patient in which Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer occurred in the area of the abdominal area , in the bones and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP had examined the answers of the company on the questions asked , there were still some questions un@@ explained .
based on the examination of the documents submitted initially , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions that will be sent to the company on day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP opinion it was not sufficiently proven that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors brings advantages for patients .
the committee also had concerns about the treatment of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the medicine .
furthermore , the company had not adequately proved that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not inform the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed drug release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective components is immediately released and the other slowly released over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , inflammation of the nas@@ al passages caused by allergies to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cous swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and young people aged 12 and older , the recommended dose of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a pill that should be taken with or without food with a glass of water .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ utter@@ ed .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medication can be reduced to con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main activity levels were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all hay fever symptoms other than con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose the patients who took aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in the symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients under aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who were left alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart hunting ) , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , or any of the other components against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) .
aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze may also not be applied to patients suffering from a bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck glaucoma ( hypertension ) , heart or vascular disease ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ may ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ) , or a risk of ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the transport of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze throughout the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it can be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking it , breaking it or ch@@ ewing it ) .
because of the lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) , Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms subsi@@ ded .
it is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days , since the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine can decrease over time with long @-@ term application .
after a decline in the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as mon@@ otherapy .
since aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within 2 weeks after finishing this therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity associated with combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ctions such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , ly@@ ur@@ id , cab@@ erg@@ oline , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , n@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient group and the data is insufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is insufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that the treatment must be stopped in case of hypertension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a strengthening of head@@ aches ) .
patients with hyper@@ ton@@ ia • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ ton@@ ia • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ ton@@ ia • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze must be suspended at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or to reduce them to their degree .
in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor test showed no significant difference between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and placebo , regardless of whether it was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in vivo , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the harm@@ lessness of the application of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not guaranteed , but experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
as reproductive studies of animals cannot always be transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze in pregnancy should not be applied .
patients should , however , be informed that in very rare cases it may result in a ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness that may lead to impairment of traffic or the ability to operate machinery .
the symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mol@@ ors , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with potential le@@ thal processes .
headache , anxiety , ag@@ grav@@ ated mi@@ tigation , muscle weakness , and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , breathing in@@ suffici@@ ency , heart rhythm disorders , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , drow@@ sin@@ ess , pre @-@ cor@@ di@@ ale pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual disturbances and hyp@@ ot@@ onia .
a CN@@ S @-@ stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( dry @-@ dry , pup@@ il @-@ star@@ re and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include inhibit@@ ing the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ Sel@@ tin on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective sl@@ ack@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials there was no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ a@@ thetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of a CN@@ S arous@@ al .
1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients were involved in the age of 12 to 78 with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies hist@@ amine @-@ antagon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher on the basis of the total score for the symptoms ( except for nas@@ al mu@@ cous swelling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine on the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets did not show any significant differences regarding sex , age or eth@@ ni@@ city .
in the course of a single dose study for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of the administration of the plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow equilibrium of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached day 10 .
as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical multi @-@ dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects of the liver were poorly metabol@@ ised .
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was bio@@ equivalent to the exposure after injection of an aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional studies on safety mac@@ rop@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , toxic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in the oral administration of rats at a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and the Pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance System described in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the allevi@@ ation of the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , to develop its effect .
aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets allevi@@ ate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose and tear@@ ing or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .

inform your doctor if you suffer or diagnose the following symptoms or diseases under the use of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze : • high blood pressure • heart ch@@ asing , pal@@ pit@@ ations • heart rhythm disorders • nausea and headache , or strengthening existing head@@ aches .
if you take Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is a non @-@ prescription medication .
usability and operation of machines When used in the recommended dosage is not to be expected that aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze leads to ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness or reduces attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze than you should inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze than you should .
if you forgot to take a dose of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze , if you forgot to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the intended time .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or notice any side effects that are not indicated in this information .
heart hunting , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , throat pain , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , sugar in the urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , fatigue , headache , sleep disorders , nerv@@ ousness and di@@ zz@@ iness .

following the market launch of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n very rarely has been reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves , swelling ) or skin rash .
cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ ase , stomach pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sleep disorders , muscle pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , cases of liver inflammation and cases of con@@ spic@@ uous liver values has also been reported very rarely .
it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate for taking ( soluble trays ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml solution .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once daily , in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup .
for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup .
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in a total of eight studies with approximately 4,@@ 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies on seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies to patients who also had asthma ) .
effectiveness was measured by identifying changes in the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ ric@@ eps , sleeping and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been presented to prove that the body de@@ values the sy@@ rup , the solution to the intake and the wax tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , if the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease in the symptom sever@@ ity ( symptom counts ) by 25 to 32 % compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving a placebo .
in both studies with Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in the scores of symptoms after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % was compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us across the European Union .
a tablet once a day , with or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous disease progression and may end after the end of the symptoms and can be resum@@ ed when re@@ appearing .
the persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and over 4 weeks ) may be recommended to patients during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
patients should , however , be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to light @-@ he@@ ade@@ dness , which may lead to impairment of traffic or the ability to serve machines .
in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ aches , this occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and at 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
this includes inhibit@@ ing the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ Sel@@ tin on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
there was no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect as part of a clinical study with multiple doses given in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine at a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear@@ ing and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and over 4 weeks .
as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated as representative of other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology in different forms can be similar and chronic patients can be rec@@ ited in a simple prospective .
since the history of hist@@ am@@ ines is a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n also leads to an improvement in symptoms in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and reduction of size and number of quad@@ rup@@ eds at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study .
an improvement in it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in comparison to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced sleep and wak@@ efulness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which the patient @-@ demo@@ s were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s -@@ population , a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was achieved in 4 % of the patients .
there are no clu@@ es for clin@@ ically relevant accumulation after a daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not entirely excluded .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n inhi@@ bits in vivo not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not react to the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies performed with L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a comparable degree of the exposure of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on conventional studies on safety mac@@ rop@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated dosing , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not reveal any particular dangers to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to allevi@@ ate symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most of the cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years of age are caused by infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there are no data which support treatment of infectious Rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and corresponding laboratory and skin tests should play a role in the diagnosis .
approximately 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabol@@ ise des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience a higher substance load ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which is subject to a limited met@@ abo@@ li@@ zation , is identical to that of children who are normally met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or a sac@@ char@@ ase @-@ is@@ som@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol has not increased the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group as in the placebo group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose reported 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
children aged between 1 and 11 who were eligible for an anti@@ hist@@ amine treatment received a daily des@@ chlor@@ at@@ a@@ ine dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( age between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( age between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
there was no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used for more than 14 days in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents there was no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo .
in an individual daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical studies led to no impairment of psych@@ om@@ otor functions .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous consumption of alcohol was neither an increase in alcohol @-@ induced loss of power nor an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear@@ ing and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and reduction of size and number of quad@@ rup@@ eds at the end of the first dose interval .
the dis@@ semination of this limiting met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was similar in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ sian ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with sy@@ rup formation on children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which are subject to limited met@@ abo@@ li@@ zation .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max was about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of approximately 120 hours .
there are no clu@@ es for clin@@ ically relevant active substance accumulation after a daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In different single dose studies , the recommended doses of AU@@ C and C@@ max in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable to those of adults who received the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is available in type III bra@@ ins with a child@@ proof polypropylene seal cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data .
there was no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses that have been applied in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day over 14 days .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown .
in controlled clinical trials there was no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily .
in a 17 single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear@@ ing and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .

there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately before the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the wax tablet is removed without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg processed tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven so far .
the overall frequency of the side effects between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the placebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile specified in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us &apos;s melting tablet proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate to the det@@ ectable formulation of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .

in a single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective sl@@ ack@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
the spread of this poorly met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pa@@ edi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and among bl@@ acks ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population .
in single dose crossover trials of A@@ eri@@ us &apos;s melting tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pedi@@ atric patients , but in connection with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years .

the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years , which are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to that of children who are normally met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or a sac@@ char@@ ase @-@ is@@ som@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group .
in infants aged 6 to 23 months , the most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo were diar@@ rho@@ ea ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2,3 % ) .
in an additional study , no side effects were observed in patients aged 6 to 11 with a single dose of 2.5 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution .
at the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents there was no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo .
in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may , depending on the duration of the symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , and

A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influ@@ enza caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new trunk of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from man to man , because humans don &apos;t have immunity ( protection ) against it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the vaccine is administered , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; foreign @-@ foreign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the immune system is later able to form antibodies faster in contact with a flu virus of this trunk .
subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognizes as foreign ) , was puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the scope of the clinical data base for ass@@ essing the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of E@@ MEA guidelines for vacc@@ ines .
if you are taking part in a clinical trial and need more information on your treatment , please contact your attending physician .
if you would like further information on the basis of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , ap@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution to intake , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination has not been studied .
a@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked which anti@@ viral medicines the patient has taken before , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood that the virus is addressed to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily , which together with twice daily 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines are taken .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ gener@@ ase depends on body weight .
in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , am@@ el@@ ase decreases the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level .
not to cure AIDS , however , can delay damage to the immune system and thereby prevent the development of AIDS @-@ related infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the drug a@@ gener@@ ase , enhanced with low dos@@ ed ri@@ de@@ on@@ avi@@ r , was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who used to be prot@@ e@@ as@@ sion@@ ists .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in the viral load after the treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously not taken any prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , after 48 weeks , more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml than under placebo , but ap@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ a also reduced the viral load , but of the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , only very few responded to the treatment .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the drug A@@ gener@@ ase , enhanced with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , lowered the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effectively as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , am@@ el@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased the virus last after four weeks compared to patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of aging ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and Fati@@ gue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase should not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
am@@ el@@ ase should also not be used in patients who take St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines that are broken down just like am@@ el@@ ase and are harmful to health at high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take a@@ gener@@ ase have the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( loss of bone tissue ) or an immune re@@ activation syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of ap@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
ap@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic enh@@ ancer Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefits of am@@ el@@ ase in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have not taken any prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or have not been proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generic term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Limited an approval for the placing of ads across the European Union .
am@@ el@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
ap@@ gener@@ ase capsules are usually to be taken for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical boo@@ sters of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is by 14 % less than by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , a@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on one milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for am@@ el@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the enhancing addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of a@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for am@@ el@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children .
ap@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to the lack of data for harm@@ lessness and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical data , the dose of am@@ el@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorders should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be carried out with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver function disorders , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
ap@@ gener@@ ase should not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent the sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ iso@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that as@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with a@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
generic capsules are usually to be used together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome .
for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing reduced liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show increased frequency of liver function disorders under anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cc@@ or@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that are metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the possible benefit of treatment prev@@ ails the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including disease Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of as@@ gener@@ ase with lov@@ ast@@ atin and si@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available for determining the drug concentration .
in patients who take these medicines at the same time , am@@ n@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the efficacy of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , however , the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ sy withdrawal symptoms , especially if even low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are given .
due to the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col content of the a@@ gener@@ ase solution to take into account , this form of formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups .
am@@ el@@ ase should be reduced to 5 times if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the presence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases in which medication was needed to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
B . higher age , and with drug dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it .
in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis occur .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can be developed at the time of introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , leading to severe clinical conditions or wor@@ sen@@ ing of symptoms .
although multi@@ fac@@ torial e@@ ti@@ ology is assumed ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with a low therapeutic l@@ ati@@ tude may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ iso@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with a low therapeutic width as@@ gener@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be combined with medicines whose active ingredients are mainly metabol@@ ised by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and associated with increased plasma levels with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
in an attempt to compensate the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver were often observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of plant preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ rus mirrors and , if possible , check the viral load and remove the St. John &apos;s wort .
a dose adjustment for one of the drugs is not required if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is given together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max being reduced by 30 % when rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were applied twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme .
52 % lower if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in the plasma , which were achieved in the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is given twice daily in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the f@@ antasi@@ es of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the revenues of di@@ gest@@ os@@ ine and as@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
the effects of ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may reduce the serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if these medicines should be used at the same time , caution is advisable as Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma level .
if these drugs are used together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical supervision should be performed , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous injection of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % and associated side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ gener@@ ase , the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , however , the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) once daily without simultaneous application of F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r observed .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can , if applied together with ather@@ ase , may cause interactions .
patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions associated with these drugs when used in combination with as@@ gener@@ ase .
based on data from other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors it is advisable that ant@@ acids should not be taken at the same time as a@@ gener@@ ase , since it may cause res@@ or@@ ption alterations .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ s@@ ants known as phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ eli@@ pine , Nic@@ ard@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il could be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
the simultaneous intake of ather@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and increase the associated side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , whereas the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol dropped by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous gift of am@@ el@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the possible benefit of a treatment prev@@ ails the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the case of H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced enh@@ ancements of the plasma levels are expected at the same time as the administration of as@@ gener@@ ase .
as plasma mirr@@ oring of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including a r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of this drug with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ ze the mirrors is recommended as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r simultaneous injection ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , a@@ gener@@ ase should not be used together with or@@ ally taken mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while at the same time use of ap@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution is required .
data on the simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am in the 3 to 4 cases .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ sy withdrawal symptoms , especially if even low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are given .
because of the low reliability of historic compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation of how to adjust the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r dose if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is given at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with as@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Standard ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , so alternative methods of contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( e.g. Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended with simultaneous gift of as@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful weighing of the potential benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected in the milk of lac@@ tic rats , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk .
a reproductive study of pregnant rats , which was administered from the evap@@ oration into the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight during breast@@ feeding .
the further development of the offspring , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
the harm@@ lessness of a@@ gener@@ a was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most adverse events associated with the treatment of as@@ gener@@ ase were mild to moderate , early on and rarely resulted in the treatment of treatment .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are associated with taking a@@ gener@@ ase or any other drug used at the same time , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .
most of the adverse events listed below date from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not receive 1200 mg of a@@ gener@@ ase twice a day .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as related to the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as in the treatment of any laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and retinal fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so @-@ cervi@@ cal fat accumulation .
among 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non pre@@ treated persons treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ ine / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ din over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( stit@@ ching ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the PRO@@ CS 300@@ 6 study , in 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s , 7 cases ( 3 % ) occurred in 24@@ 1 patients ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , with or without it@@ ching and occurred usually during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without having to cancel the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported especially in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in the case of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can be developed at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
with PI pre @-@ treated patients receiving 600 mg of as@@ gener@@ ase twice a day together with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of side effects ( Grade 3 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were very common in patients who received ather@@ ase along with low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is able to observe signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary to initiate necessary supporting measures .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the process of viral G@@ ag@@ - and ga@@ g @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ protein prec@@ urs@@ ors with the result of a formation of in@@ mature , non @-@ infectious viral particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range between 0.0@@ 12 and 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells .
the correlation between the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ dos@@ ages - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r stained treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations were rarely observed .
in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg of F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates being gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients who were not previously treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns similar to those found in adults .

in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day : n = 107 ) treatment with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors occurred in patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure over 96 weeks , following the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or f@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / M , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M as well as a reduced probability of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations may be subject to additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used in combination with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or f@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( divi@@ der points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four genetic patterns associated with reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r creates a certain cross resistance to rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data on cross resistance between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non pre@@ treated patients , in which a F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( containing a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 insul@@ ators ) , and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 insul@@ ators ) appear .
conver@@ sely , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r keeps its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ sion@@ ist @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early termination of a failure therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that can affect subsequent treatment adver@@ sely .
the evidence of efficacy of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open trial , in which with PI pre@@ treated adults after vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( viral load ≥ 1000 copies / ml ) with a PI , predominantly fired with low @-@ dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to as@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI have been included in the part study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis showed the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C PI group in terms of time @-@ adjusted A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ lam@@ eness threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ blocked arter@@ ies is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI .
in the studies , ap@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking and capsules in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of the patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with as@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml for a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell numbers of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 B@@ ased on this data , the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in the treatment optimisation of the children treated with PI . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral dosing , the mean duration ( T@@ max ) is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max on the other hand lowered by 30 % when rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) was given .
the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal results in a 25 % decrease of the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosing ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the steady state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained unaffected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of absorption .
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active constitu@@ ent fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval , depending on the total oxygen concentrations in the steady state over the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or present a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be given with care if they are given at the same time with a@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , results in a similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , a@@ gener@@ ase solution and a@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schemes lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those found in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without the simultaneous administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity of mice and rats occurred in male animals ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas in doses that correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - multiple ( rat ) exposure to humans , after twice daily dosing of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the gen@@ esis of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials as well as from the therapeutic application , there was little evidence of the acceptance of clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in vitro and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , containing bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ core test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations of human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical practice by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase activity .
in clinical trials , no significant liver toxic@@ ity has been observed in patients , neither during the administration of as@@ gener@@ ase nor after the end of the treatment .
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
in systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly below ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure under therapeutic dos@@ ages in humans , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicate delayed development .
24 If a@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the enhancing addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of a@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for am@@ el@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be performed with caution in patients with mild or mild liver function disorders , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available for determining the active substance concentration .
am@@ el@@ ase should be suspended in the long term 27 when a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and drug @-@ dependent factors such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max being reduced by 30 % when rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in the plasma , which were achieved in the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is given twice daily in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
if these drugs are used together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical supervision should be performed , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data available .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ eli@@ pine , Nic@@ ard@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il might be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , whereas the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol dropped by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with as@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Standard ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0,@@ 0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ fusion ) led to a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % or respectively .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful weighing of the potential benefits for the mother compared to the potential risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproductive study of pregnant rats , which was administered from the evap@@ oration into the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during breast@@ feeding .
the harm@@ lessness of a@@ gener@@ a was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is able to observe signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary to initiate necessary supporting measures .
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range between 0.0@@ 12 and 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M with acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
conver@@ sely , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r keeps its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ sion@@ ist @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on this data , the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; a@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in the treatment optimisation of the children treated with PI .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active constitu@@ ent fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval , depending on the total oxygen concentrations in the steady state over the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss ..
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or present a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be given with care if they are given at the same time with a@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction on the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be minor .
long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity of mice and rats occurred in male animals ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas in doses that correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - multiple ( rat ) exposure to humans after twice daily dosing of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been solved and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials as well as from the therapeutic application , there was little evidence of the acceptance of clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in vitro and in @-@ vitro @-@ gene toxic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ core test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations of human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that in young animals the metabol@@ isation routes are not yet fully mature , so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z .
in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards are shown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; b@@ oo@@ ster@@ one &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stained &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake was not proven either in patients treated with PI or with PI previously treated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is by 14 % less than by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , a@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on one milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should , once they are able to swallow the capsules , stop taking the solution to take in ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for a@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , since no dose recommendation for simultaneous application of as@@ gener@@ ase can be given to intake and low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination is avoided in these patient groups .
although a dose adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered to be necessary , an application of as@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with ren@@ al failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ col , A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in infants and children under the age of 4 , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
the simultaneous administration may result in a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabol@@ isation of these drugs and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z .
patients should be advised that as@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that it will continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with a@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of 47 from transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring the International Standard R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the concentration of active substances .
am@@ el@@ ase should be removed in the long term if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug 49 dependent factors such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis occur .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max being reduced by 30 % when rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the simultaneous intake of ather@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and lead to associated side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
based on the data of 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected after oral dosing of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not well @-@ known . as@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking may not be applied during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the included prop@@ yl gly@@ col during pregnancy ( see section 4.3 ) .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected in the milk of lac@@ tic rats , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk .
a reproductive study of pregnant rats , which was administered from the evap@@ oration into the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 55 body weight during breast@@ feeding .
the harm@@ lessness of a@@ gener@@ a was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are associated with taking a@@ gener@@ ase or any other drug used at the same time , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ dos@@ ages - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r stained treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations were rarely observed .
the early departure of a se@@ eding 60 therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that can affect subsequent treatment adver@@ sely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 B@@ ased on this data , the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in the treatment optimisation of the children treated with PI . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be connected to a large ve@@ to volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .

the application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the condition to be treated : • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is to be applied five times a week for six weeks .
before going to bed , the cream is th@@ inn@@ ed to the affected skin areas so that it leaves enough long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( same cream but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients treated with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two trials , in which the patients were treated for six weeks and al@@ dar@@ a or the placebo had either daily or five times weekly .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses .
• In all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete healing rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % for patients treated with placebo . • The results of both studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete healing rate of 66 % to 80 % compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application area of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ker@@ at@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults when the size or number of les@@ ions limit the efficacy and / or the acceptance of cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .
on Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) apply before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream can continue until all visible occur@@ ren@@ ces have disappeared in the genital or perio@@ don@@ tal area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an interruption in the treatment process described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated les@@ ions are only incomplete , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream once he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual therapeutic plan .
apply I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in a thin layer and rub in the clean@@ sed , infected skin area until the cream is completely absorbed .
there should be a reduction in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
it should be a balancing act between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the associated risk associated with possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction .
in other studies , where no daily intake of in@@ timacy was carried out , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and one case were observed with a cord leading to circumcision .
for an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses an increased risk of severe local skin irritation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases severe local skin irritation was observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or led to a temporary physical impairment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine that necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream directly after the treatment with other cut@@ aneous inj@@ ections for the treatment of external clin@@ gs in the genital and perio@@ don@@ tal region , no clinical experience has yet to be found .
although limited data suggest an increased rate of clin@@ ker reductions in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream has shown a lower effectiveness in this group of patients with regard to the removal of the clin@@ chers .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips or the hair@@ line has not been studied .
local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during therapy or the reactions are back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s complaints or due to the sever@@ ity of the local skin reactions , a treatment break may be made several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since no data is currently available over long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in case of super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
there are no clinical experiences in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , so the use of previously untreated tum@@ ors is not recommended .
data from an open clinical study point out that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower lik@@ el@@ ihood of responding to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area inside the lip .
there are only very limited data on the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses at anatom@@ ic locations outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions normal@@ y usually decrease in the course of therapy or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if the local skin reactions cause a lot of discomfort to the patient or are very strong , the treatment may be suspended for a few days .
data from an open clinical study showed that patients with more than 8 les@@ ions showed a lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immun@@ o @-@ stimulating characteristics , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies have no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , de@@ bonding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although quanti@@ fied serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) were not achieved either after unique or repeated topical application , no recommendation can be given to use during breast@@ feeding .
the most commonly reported and likely or possibly associated with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the location of the treatment of the clin@@ ically ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the most commonly reported and likely or possibly associated with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in connection with side effects include discomfort on the application site with an incidence of 28.@@ 1 % .
bas@@ ali@@ oma patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream from a placebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical study reported adverse events are shown below .
the most common , probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in connection with related side effects , were in these studies a reaction at the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
adverse events reported from 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trials with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis are listed below .
these clinical signs , according to the protocol , show that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od creme frequently occurred on local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cre@@ ting / ab@@ sc@@ aling ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) .
according to the study protocol , the evaluation of clinical signs shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od creme very often leads to severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe erosion ( 13 % ) , and too heavy swe@@ ating and c@@ rest ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials investigating the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was observed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment center or in the surrounding area .
the unique oral recording of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ onia which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid indication .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical examination the systemic concentration of the alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines was detected after the topical application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies it was possible to show that the efficacy in relation to a complete healing of the clin@@ chers with an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od management over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment is clearly superior .
at 60 % of all patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od patients were treated completely ; this was the case with 20 % of the patients who had been treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
complete healing was achieved at 23 % of 15@@ 7 male patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared to 5 % of 161 male patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od over 6 weeks per week was investigated in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary superficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data presented in an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od on three times weekly application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four week , treatment @-@ free period , was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic les@@ ions within a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous 25 c@@ m2 area of treatment on the un@@ ha@@ iry scal@@ p or face .
the one @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two periods of treatment .
the approved indications external clin@@ ically , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ fici@@ ally BC@@ Cs do not usually occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was studied in four random@@ ised double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies of children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the dos@@ ages investigated there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or more ) .
a minimal systemic intake of 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest concentrations of pharmaceuticals in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml when used in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 disposable p@@ ou@@ ch ) , on scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2@@ h half @-@ life time after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the absorption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od after topical application on MC @-@ infected skin of patients aged 6 - 12 years was low and comparable to that found in healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study of der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rat doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study carried out four months for the der@@ mal application yiel@@ ded no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice at three days per week did not indu@@ ce tumours on the application .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ able , there is a risk for man due to systemic exposure to be regarded as very low .
tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the substance @-@ free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

the study mainly investig@@ ates the safety of the drug , but it was also measured its effectiveness ( by examining its effect regarding the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me reduced the amount of G@@ AG in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the children treated showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever , and reactions to the in@@ fusion .
very common side effects in patients under the age of five are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medi@@ c@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all the new information that may be known and updated whenever necessary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me regarding the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission issued approval to the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me across the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be performed by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years was not determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suffici@@ ency was not determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions defined as any side effect associated with in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be performed in an appropriate clinical environment in which re@@ vit@@ alization facilities are immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that almost all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms ( see sections 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since there is little experience regarding resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , due to the theore@@ tically elevated risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions following an interruption of treatment must be cau@@ ti@@ ously preferred .
treat 60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ reti@@ ca ) in order to minimize the potential incidence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in the event of a light or moderate in@@ fusion reaction , the treatment should be considered with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in the event of a single serious in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction has occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ a@@ ine because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular intake of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal @-@ experimental studies do not cause direct or indirect harmful effects on the pregnancy that include embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since no data is available on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase via breast milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( duration of treatment up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the phase III study and their extension with a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older , are listed in the following table according to the following frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions also occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing still@@ ness and ob@@ verse ede@@ ma ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted drug effects related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study involving 20 patients under the age of 5 , with a predominantly severe exp@@ ir@@ ation form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients , a ser@@ o@@ con@@ ic version occurred within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment , with a more severe form of ser@@ o@@ con@@ ic in patients under the age of 5 ( average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients with age of 5 years and older ) .
up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or early withdrawal from the study ) , there were no antibodies that could be detected in 13 / 45 patients ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , including 3 patients who had never come to Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with low to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG level in the urine , while a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was observed in patients with high antibody ti@@ des .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ing effect on the enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro , which did not appear to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not seem to be associated with adverse drug reactions in connection with the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for enzyme replacement therapy lies in one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accum@@ ulating medium and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient recovery of enzyme activity .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , the most likely about man@@ nose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study in 45 patients aged 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited to study the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were of the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for effectiveness were the percentage changes in the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 minute walk .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received another 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and the ability to walk in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as highlighted in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is not clin@@ ically significant over this period and the absolute lung volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the body size of children .
of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study had a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks , a clear drop in the G@@ AG mirror was detected in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) , which remained constant until the end of the study .
in terms of hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between patients who have been considered clin@@ ically significant changes across five efficacy variables ( expected percentage of normal FE@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk , range of motion of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , there was generally an improvement in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in 20 patients who were 5 years old at the time of their inclusion ( 16 patients with severe form and 4 with mean follow @-@ up ) .
in four patients , the dosage increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased G@@ ag@@ ar M@@ irr@@ ors in the urine in week 22 .
in several patients a size increase ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined according to the Z @-@ S@@ core for this age group . the younger patients with the severe form of circulation ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental development speed whereas in the older patients with severe form of circulation only limited or no progress in cognitive development were to be determined .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ met@@ ry dosing schemes were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent .
the European Medi@@ c@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the medicine will be updated .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical profile in patients under the age of 5 was similar to that of elderly and less severely affected patients .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine for cancer ) in patients who have not received chemotherapy ( medicines for cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer that does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole therapy in patients who have not previously been treated , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies .
to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and get inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is given together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an additional &quot; anti@@ thesis &quot; ( medicines for vom@@ iting ) and fluids ( to prevent liquid deficiency ) should be given before or after the addition of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients whose blood type changes or certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , dis@@ continued or the dose should be decreased .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed s@@ lows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from spl@@ itting .
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form goes more easily into cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the medicine and a longer active time in cancer cells .
for the treatment of malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was studied in a major study on 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared to the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another cancer medicine ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin lived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared with 9.@@ 3 months for the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.@@ 3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients in which cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells had longer survival compared to the comparative medication during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. to transport A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each water bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dose is taken from the water bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small terminal bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of second @-@ line treatment of patients with loc@@ ales advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma except for predomin@@ ating plate @-@ epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin amounts to 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid should be given the day before and on the day of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed gift and on the day after the treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must continue throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) a week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose and after each third treatment cycle .
in patients receiving p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , a complete blood picture should be produced before each gift , including a differentiation of leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place taking into account the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of previous therapy cycles .
after the recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are applicable for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ Grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient has the value prior to treatment
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if in patients after 2 dose reduc@@ tion@@ - a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - at the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or above , an increased side effect risk exists in patients at the age of 65 or above .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 due to insufficient data for harm@@ lessness and efficacy .
in clinical trials , no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the dose adap@@ tations recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - B@@ order value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3,@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies .
patients must be monitored and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must not be given to patients before their absolute number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils again has a value of ≥ 1,500 cells / mm ³ and the plat@@ el@@ et number again has a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of the absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ us number , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and non@@ toxic toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was observed when pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed need to be instructed to apply fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic @-@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous use of non @-@ ster@@ oid@@ al anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ sali@@ cy@@ c@@ lei@@ c acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients for treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed need to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hypertension or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , drainage of the eff@@ usion before p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment is to be considered .
5 major cardiovascular events including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical trials involving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed occasionally when this active ingredient was usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to the reproductive capacity of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised before the treatment tin to obtain advice on sperm conservation .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ ster@@ oid@@ al anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ IDs , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) can result in reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed precip@@ itation with the consequence of an increased occurrence of side effects .
therefore caution is advised if high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or as@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses are used in patients with normal kidney function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , in the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed are avoided ( see section 4.4 ) .
since no data on the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ IDs is available with long half @-@ life like Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be prevented for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed .
the in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Standard R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat patients with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , serious birth defects are expected in an application during pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must not be used during pregnancy except when it is absolutely necessary and after careful weighing of the benefits for the mother and the risk of the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity is made by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised before the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice regarding sperm handling .
it is not known whether p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed passes into the breast milk and unwanted effects on the breast@@ fed baby cannot be ruled out .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of unwanted effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma and the random@@ ized C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed - as well as 16@@ 3 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma who were random@@ ized to receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

these differences are likely to result in differences in the patient population as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and significantly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal initial values of liver function tests .

clinical studies have occasionally reported cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal disease , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ litis ) .
in clinical trials patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment occasionally reported cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory failure .
it was reported about cases of acute ren@@ al failure in P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chem@@ o@@ therapeutic agents ( see section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation @-@ pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients who were treated before , during or after their P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ) is a ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fung@@ al that ex@@ erts its effect by interrup@@ ting important fol@@ ate @-@ dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed works with multiple targets by blocking the thy@@ me dy@@ late syn@@ th@@ ase ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ ate reduc@@ t@@ ase ( DH@@ FR ) and Gly@@ cin@@ am@@ i@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ d@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , which are the fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes of de nov@@ o bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ - and pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi@@ center , random@@ ised , simple @-@ blind Phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for chemotherapy patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma showed that with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin patients had a clin@@ ically meaningful benefit of a medi@@ an 2.8 @-@ months longer survival compared to those patients who were only cur@@ led with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was done in the population of all patients who received the investig@@ ational medicine in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ ea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) in relation to the single C@@ is@@ pl@@ ine arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms resulted from an improvement of the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a decline in the lung function over time in the control arm .
a multi @-@ center , random@@ ised , open phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA versus doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC followed by medi@@ an survival of 8.@@ 3 months in patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .

the resulting solution is clear and the coloring ranges from color@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish @-@ yellow , without compromising the quality of the product .
it is used in overweight adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) ≥ 28 kg per square meter combined with low cal@@ orie , fat @-@ reduced nutrition .
patients who take All@@ i and do not receive weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot metabol@@ ise some fats in the food , causing about a quarter of the fats contained with the food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines .
in a third study All@@ i was compared with 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 compared to placebo .
in both studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took All@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
the study with All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 could not be observed for patients with relevant weight loss .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s at anus , fl@@ atus ( winds ) with bow@@ el lab@@ ours , bow@@ el movement , gre@@ asy / o@@ ily chair , outlet o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( rot@@ ting ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it must not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may also not be used in patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( which does not absorb enough nutrients from the digestive tract ) or to ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant or nursing mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Limited an approval for the transport of or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K throughout the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( body mass index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ cal@@ oric , low @-@ fat diet .
all@@ i should not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because insufficient data on efficacy and safety are not available .
however , as or@@ list@@ at is only moder@@ ately res@@ or@@ bed , the dosage is not necessary in the elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• Pre@@ mature treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Chr@@ onic mal@@ absorption ( see section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature ( see section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich snack or low @-@ fat diet .
since the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy because the dose of anti@@ diabe@@ tic has to be adapted .
patients taking all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol levels should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these medicines has to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnancy @-@ contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures in order to prevent possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a reduction of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( international standard @-@ ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials remained the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta carot@@ ene in the normal range .
however , patients should be advised to take a complementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the dose of a single dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a marginal decline in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time .
animal @-@ experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are associated with the pharmac@@ ological action of the drug , as the absorption of captured fat is prevented .
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) .
the incidence of reported adverse events reported after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown , since these events have voluntarily been reported by a population of a certain size .
† Es is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i may lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and obes@@ e subjects without significant clinical findings .
most of the cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose reported after the market launch have either reported no side effects or similar side effects as reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on studies on humans and animals , a rapid recovery of possible systemic effects can be assumed , resulting from the lip@@ ase inhibit@@ ory properties of or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect is used in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding to the active Ser@@ in remnant of the ga@@ stri@@ an and p@@ ank@@ re@@ ati@@ cal lip@@ ases .
from clinical trials , 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at was taken three times a day , which blocks the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled adults with BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60@@ mg or@@ list@@ at which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ or@@ ical , low @-@ fat diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was assessed as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( table 1 ) and as a percentage of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( table 2 ) .
although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first six months .
the mean change in the total cholesterol was 60 mg / 2.4 % with or@@ list@@ at ( bas@@ eline 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in LD@@ L cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 3.8 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at waist circum@@ ference the mean change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3,@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( starting value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral dosing of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at could be detected spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation .
in a study with obes@@ e patients the minimal systemic res@@ or@@ ption was given , two main metabol@@ ites could be identified , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after separation of the N @-@ Form@@ yl leu@@ cine group ) , which represented approximately 42 % of the total plasma concentration .
based on conventional studies on safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated dosing , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot identify any particular danger to humans .

food di@@ aries are effective , as you can understand at any time what you eat , how much you eat and it will likely be easier to change your dietary habits .
to ensure your target weight , you should set two daily goals in advance : one for the calories and one for fat .
• En@@ try fatty acids to reduce the lik@@ el@@ ihood of nutritional complications ( see section 4 ) . • T@@ ry to move more before starting taking the capsules .
remember to ask your doctor in advance if you are not used to physical activity . • Sta@@ y physically active while taking and after the ing@@ es@@ tion of all@@ i .
• Al@@ i may not be taken more than 6 months . • If you cannot find any reduction in your weight after 12 weeks of use of all@@ i , please consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice .
you may need to stop taking all@@ i . • For a successful weight loss it is not about switching your diet on short notice and returning to the old habits .
• If less than one hour has passed since the last meal , take the capsule intake . • If more than one hour has passed since the last meal , take no capsule .

severe allergic reactions • severe allergic reactions can be seen in the following changes : severe breathing difficulties , swe@@ ats , skin r@@ ashes , it@@ ching , swelling of the face , heart rate , circul@@ atory collapse .
29 Very common side effects These can occur in more than 1 out of 10 individuals who take all@@ i . • blo@@ ating ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) with and without a holy ex@@ iting • Su@@ dden chair Inform@@ ing your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of these side effects increases or is significantly affected .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or notice any side effects that are not indicated in this information .
the most common side effects are associated with the effect of the capsules and are caused by the fact that more fat is ex@@ cre@@ ted from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of the treatment , as you might not have consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet at this time .
with the following basic rules , you can learn to minim@@ ise nutritional benefits : • Start already a few days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of portions that you normally consume .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ el@@ ihood that you are exceeding your fat limit decreases . • Share your recommended amount of fat evenly on your daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat that you are allowed to take per meal , not to take it in the form of a fat @-@ rich main court or a substantial night@@ stand , as you may possibly have done in other programs for weight reduction . • Most people with whom these accompanying symptoms occur learn to control them with time by adjusting their diet .
• Store medicines for children in@@ accessible . • Do not store all@@ i after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date stated on the cart@@ on . • Do not store over 25 ° C . • Ke@@ ep container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ licate gel that serve to keep the capsules dry .
do not swallow them . • You can take your daily dose all@@ i in the blue transport box ( shuttle ) attached to this pack .

permanent weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and more exercise , can prevent the emergence of serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients and gradually learn to permanently eat heal@@ th@@ ily .
energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you also find as an indication of the packaging of foods . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should consume at most a day .
note the below tables below . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
see the information below , which indicates the number of calories that is appropriate for you . • D@@ ue to the mode of action of the capsule , compliance with recommended fat intake is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot handle this amount of fat .
by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maximize weight loss while reducing the lik@@ el@@ ihood of nutritional defici@@ encies . • You should try to decrease gradually and continuously .
34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to lose weight gradually and continuously about 0.5 kg per week , without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; Low physical activity &quot; means that you can burn 150 k@@ cal per day , e.g. through 3 km of walking , 30@@ - to 45 minutes gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes .
• For permanent weight loss it is necessary to set realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and adhere to them . • Sens@@ ory is a nutrition journal with information on the cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before starting taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a diet plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed cal@@ orie and fat du@@ ets and give guidelines to become more physically active .

Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are moderate causes for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the efficacy of al@@ an@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti @-@ eme@@ tics ) .
the application for patients under 18 years of age is not recommended , as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group .
this means that the active agent prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
in three main studies , Alo@@ xi was studied in 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate causes for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in the case of chemotherapy , the severe trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in the case of chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate release for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission issued approval to the company of Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . , an approval for the marketing application of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
al@@ an@@ xi is indicated : for prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to a cancer and for prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the efficacy of al@@ op@@ xi for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid given prior to chemotherapy .
as Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on massage , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of sub@@ acute i@@ le@@ us after injection should be closely monitored .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is required with simultaneous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with the Q@@ T interval extended or which tend to such an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi is not intended to be used to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit tumor activity of the five chemotherapy drugs investigated ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ in , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady St@@ ate@@ - Con@@ centr@@ ation of oral Met@@ o@@ clo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) as well as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( am@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ran@@ iti@@ dine , k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ aline , and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) have no significant effect on the leg@@ acies of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences for the use of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies do not occur , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the treating physician .
in clinical trials , the most common side effects were observed at a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least might have been related to Alo@@ xi , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the location ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing testim@@ oni@@ als .
in the group with the highest dose similar frequencies of un@@ desired occur@@ ren@@ ces were observed as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effect relationships observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out due to the large distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy for an al@@ lied over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies a total of 1,@@ 132 patients receiving moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 of doc@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 m@@ g. of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life of 7.@@ 3 hours ) were given that was given intraven@@ ously at day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron which were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 .
results of studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
in clinical trials of indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after clinical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and pro@@ long the duration of the action potential .
the objective of the study carried out at 2@@ 21 healthy subjects was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ v. given Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After IV dosing follows an initial decrease of plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average termin@@ ally half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dos@@ ed propor@@ tionally in the total dose range from 0,@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
following IV dose of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase in the pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical simulations show that the overall position measured at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on 3 consecutive days was comparable with that measured after a one @-@ time IV administration of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ max was higher after the one @-@ time injection of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys , and about 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in vitro studies on met@@ abo@@ li@@ zation we have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a lesser extent , are involved in the is@@ o@@ enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 on the metabolism of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , approximately 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an imm@@ utable ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
following a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous bol@@ us injection , the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearance of 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although in patients with severe liver dysfunction the termin@@ ale elimination cycle time and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical trials effects were observed only after expos@@ ures , which are considered adequately above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , indicating a low relevance for clinical use .
10 Out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies revealed indications that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ions in very high concentrations that are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the duration of the action .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to about 30 times the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al glands ) and skin tumours in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for one @-@ time use , the relevance of these results is regarded as low for humans .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report in which the approval of approval for the use of the medicine prescribed for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicinal ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refer@@ enced Medi@@ c@@ inal Products &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infections ) .
in a micro@@ scopic examination the liver tissue damages damage , plus the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ o fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood ab@@ norm@@ alize .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimulates these to the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of alpha eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study showed how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment were treated ( i.e. no signs of the virus reported in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non business purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged .
furthermore , concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed will not suff@@ ice .
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ el@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical trial .
after setting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ e@@ eon , the disease was more resistant to more patients than with the reference drug . moreover , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from this , the study used in the study was not sufficiently validated to investigate the extent to which the drug generates an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) .
it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected dor@@ man@@ s , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections which have been proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ ine @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go may not work against these kinds of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied to patients from the age of nine months , but in patients less than 18 years the skin surface should not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment after two to three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell , in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of the efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients under placebo said treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin patients , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together with skin patients , approximately 90 % of both groups responded to treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go is not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( iron @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in body tissue ) or infections that have been proven or probably caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irritation on the job .
the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of al@@ tar@@ go were predomin@@ ated in the short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections compared to the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ fir@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . Ltd . , an approval for the marketing of Al@@ tar@@ go across the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of sensi@@ tization or serious local irritation due to the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine o@@ int@@ ment , the treatment is canc@@ eled , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully wi@@ ped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection is started .
retin@@ am@@ ni@@ on should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as a patho@@ gen or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials of secondary infections , the efficacy of retin@@ os@@ in@@ ulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs after a 2 to 3 day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ines and other topical remedies on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans following topical application on sk@@ ated skin or infected surface wounds , clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vivo is not to be expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous oral dosing of 2 times a day 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ino@@ in AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after topical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine o@@ int@@ ment were increased by 81 % after topical application of healthy adult men .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dose adjustments are not considered necessary if topical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ o@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral intake and are inadequate in relation to a statement affecting the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ino@@ o@@ int@@ ment should only be used during pregnancy if topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retin@@ os@@ ul@@ ine is prefer@@ able to the administration of systemic antibiotics .
in deciding whether breast@@ feeding continues / finishes or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continues / terminated , the benefits of breast@@ feeding should be considered for the baby and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for women .
in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , which have applied al@@ tar@@ go , the most common reported side effect irritation at the administration point , which concerned approximately 1 % of the patients .
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ino@@ sis is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ er@@ anus ( formerly ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ er@@ anus ) .
the active mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ i@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a certain binding site of the 50s sub @-@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ om , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding site is involved in the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P binding site and the pe@@ p@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase centre .
by binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pe@@ p@@ tide transfer , blocking partial P @-@ binding interactions and prevents the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin appears question@@ able in at least some infection forms , counselling should be sought by experts .
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of retin@@ os@@ in@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , irrespective of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of failure to respond to treatment with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of trun@@ ks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion to intact and pe@@ eled skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ o@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ ola is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children between 1 and 15 years old , which are not immune to these two diseases . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix will be applied within the framework of a two @-@ dose vacc@@ ination plan , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation and that the vacc@@ ination plan existing from two doses may end .
if a refres@@ her dose is required for hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or other hepatitis A or B vaccine may be given .
vacc@@ ines work by contributing to the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , as it can fight against a disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alien &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and generates antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as the vacc@@ ines approved since 1996 and the vacc@@ ination approved since 1997 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a three @-@ dose vacc@@ ination plan .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective anti @-@ antibody concentration a month after the last injection .
in an additional study involving 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix initiated between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection for the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar to six and a 12 month intervals between inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection place , redness , fatigue , and irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components , or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smi@@ th@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals to the company of Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smi@@ th@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals .
the standardi@@ zation plan for imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two doses of vaccine , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a booster shot is required for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B , it can be ino@@ cul@@ ated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or a combination vaccine .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ V ) .
it is not yet fully assured that immun@@ o@@ competent individuals who have responded to a Hepatitis A@@ - ino@@ cul@@ ation need a booster shot as protection , as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in case of no longer veri@@ fiable antibodies .
3 As with all vacc@@ ines , an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction following the injection of the vaccine should always be available immediately after the injection of the vaccine .
if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended using the combination vaccine containing 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and individuals with disorders of the immune system , no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ s and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody levels are achieved , so that additional ino@@ cul@@ ation doses may be required in these cases .
since intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intra@@ muscular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal imp@@ lication in the glut@@ eal muscles , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
in case of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ots , Ambi@@ rix can only be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ e@@ ously since it can result in bleeding in these cases after intra@@ muscular administration .
if Ambi@@ rix was given in the form of a separate injection together with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza type b @-@ vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined meas@@ ur@@ - m@@ umps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immun@@ o@@ defici@@ encies , it is assumed that no adequate immune response is achieved .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ernity , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier Thi@@ omer@@ cial and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations ranging from 1 to 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared to that of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ edness on a basis of calculation per acc@@ dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on a basis for calculation per person .
pain was observed after the dose of Ambi@@ rix at 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of subjects compared with 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in subjects after the dose of a 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had given Ambi@@ ola reported pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
the frequency of mat@@ ernity was comparable to a pro@@ band ( i.e. over the entire vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of subjects receiving Ambi@@ ola compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the incidence of severe pain and mat@@ ernity was low and comparable to that observed after the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ inations , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ gruppe was comparable to that observed in administration of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of de@@ chlor@@ inated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
the proportion of vacc@@ inations , which reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of de@@ activated hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen , was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V were 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for the month of 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose administered for the month of 6 ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was worth@@ less , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher in the month 2 and 6 after the addition of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immun@@ o@@ therapies that were achieved in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
people who were between 12 and 15 years old at the time of pri@@ mer@@ isation could demonstrate the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ s and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies for at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immune response observed in this study was comparable to that found after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical trial at 12 to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it was shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ s and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies can be compared 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme to that in the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year was given at the same time with the booster shot of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza type b @-@ vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les @-@ m@@ umps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar serum and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates similar to earlier formulation for the current formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing on any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through virus @-@ based foods and drinks , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as bathing in water contaminated by sewage .
you may feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may necess@@ itate a steady treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not completely protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the full ino@@ cul@@ ation series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child is already infected with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vacc@@ ination doses ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or sick at the time of vacc@@ ination ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those after hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection can not be medi@@ ated .
• If you / your child already showed an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
allergic reaction may cause it@@ chy skin erup@@ tions , short@@ ness of breath , or swelling of the face or tongue . • If an allergic reaction has occurred with you or your child , an earlier vaccine against hepatitis A or hepatitis B occurs . • If you / your child have a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the usually scheduled dose of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
at a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he / her child will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective components per acc@@ ato dose ( 360 ELISA units of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective components is usually administered one month after the first dose and should give your child a vacc@@ ination protection prior to ending the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes , Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected among people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child is weak due to illness or treatment in your body &apos;s own defence , or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction is to vacc@@ ination .
21 Sa@@ y to your doctor if you / your child is taking other medicines ( including those that you can get without prescri@@ bing ) or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated / / or immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) have been given / or this is planned in the near future .
it may , however , be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be ino@@ cul@@ ated at separate places and as different limbs as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pregnant or breast@@ feeding women is not given , unless it is urgently needed to be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B . &quot; &quot; &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you / your child already showed an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible .
♦ very common ( more than one case per 10 bl@@ ended cans ) : • P@@ ain or discomfort on the insertion location or redness • Fati@@ gue • irrit@@ ability • headache • loss of appetite
♦ often ( up to 1 case per 10 dec@@ im@@ ated cans ) : • swelling at the injection place • fever ( above 38 ° C ) • ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness • gastro@@ intestinal complaints
other side effects reported for days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 recycled drinking cans ) are :
these include locally restricted or extended envel@@ opes which can itch or infl@@ ate , swelling of the eye area and face , sw@@ inging breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure drop and loss of consciousness .

23 Tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you / your child significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this package supplement .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of the data , which have been known since the issu@@ ance of the first approval for the placing on the market , the CH@@ MP opinion that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix was placed in circulation only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to the low patient exposure .
Am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ complete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ia mic en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage as a result of high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in the pre@@ history .
Am@@ mon@@ aps is - split by several single doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered via a gastro@@ intestinal tube ( through the stomach @-@ leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) .
it was not a comparative study because Am@@ mon@@ soon could not be compared with a different treatment or placebo ( a dum@@ my drug , that is , without substance ) .
ammon@@ ium can also result in loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , fluid retention , pal@@ p@@ itation , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that am@@ mon@@ t@@ aps in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle are effectively prevented from high ammon@@ ia values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ soon was approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because due to the r@@ arity of the disease , only limited information about this medicine was available at the time of approval . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients in which a complete enzyme shortage has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) there is then an indication for use if a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy is present in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ule form .
the daily dose is calculated individually , taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient needed for growth and development .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day for children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ cot@@ yl alcohol .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ atal syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders as there is a risk of the formation of o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
each dose of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as in case of sodium retention and ede@@ ma .
since metabol@@ isation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is carried out over the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results with regard to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats at high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , there was a slow@@ ing of neur@@ onal proliferation and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the mother &apos;s milk by humans , and for this reason , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , at least 56 % of patients had at least one adverse event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed to have not been associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tate , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , cur@@ ry top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 month old inf@@ ant with an in@@ ad@@ mitt@@ edly single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity with intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is an metabol@@ ite active compound that is con@@ jug@@ ated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys .
Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ro@@ genous atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for the elimination of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate recorded for each gram is produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that diagnosis is made at an early stage and treatment is immediately initiated in order to improve survival and clinical results .
the pre@@ diction of the early manifest form of the disease coinci@@ ded with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns , and the disease even led to death in the treatment of per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues within the first year of life .
by hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative methods of nit@@ rate precip@@ itation ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced food and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns in post@@ part@@ al ( however , within the first life month ) of diagnosed diseases to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first onset of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it was time with many to mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ote form of the Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ scar@@ path@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and after that were permanently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in the case of treatment and a further wor@@ sen@@ ing of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur in some patients .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine , whereby phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is produced .
concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined after dosing of a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected 15 minutes after intake .
in the majority of patients with ure@@ a @-@ fatigue or ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in @-@ opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was not det@@ ectable in the plasma after night fasting .
in three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts .
the drug is secre@@ ted by the kidneys within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
according to the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat did not have a toxic effect with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral dosing of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who cannot swallow tablets or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a gastro@@ intestinal tube or a nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day for children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ cot@@ yl alcohol .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
if rat @-@ fl@@ utes were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) before birth , there were les@@ ions in the pyramid cells of the cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tate , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , cur@@ ry top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ro@@ genous atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for the elimination of excess
based on studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it is assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is recorded for each gram between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are unlikely to be reversible either , and a further wor@@ sen@@ ing of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur in some patients .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ule form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected 15 minutes after intake .
during the duration of the shelf life the patient can store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not more than 25 ° C .
in this procedure the small measuring spoon is 0,@@ 95 g , the measuring spoon is 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate .
if a patient has to receive the medication by means of a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water prior to use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accumulate in the body after consuming proteins .
if you perform laboratory tests , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can influence the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is a non @-@ prescription medication .
during breast@@ feeding , you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as the medicine could go over to breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases confusion , headache , taste disturbances , hin@@ dran@@ ces of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and a wor@@ sen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions have also been observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms you immediately contact your doctor or with the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating appropriate treatment .
if you miss taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

they should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS to the same single doses or@@ ally or via a ga@@ stri@@ c tube ( hose that passes through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose that is led through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Take a he@@ aped spo@@ on@@ ful of gran@@ ulate from the container . • Place a straight edge , e.g. a knife edge over the edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • The amount remaining in the measuring spoon is equivalent to a measuring spoon . • Take the recommended number of measuring spo@@ ons of gran@@ ulate from the container .
An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example with inst@@ able ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measurement value for electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients undergoing a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of an@@ gi@@ ox in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) was compared with the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I .
during the PCI , the patient often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube left in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots such as Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the administration of GP@@ I - was as effective in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or re@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year as effectively as conventional treatment .
in patients undergoing a PCI , an@@ gi@@ ox in terms of all indicators was as effective as he@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding in which it was much more effective than He@@ par@@ in .
An@@ gi@@ ox must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ ologi@@ cal@@ ine , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or any of the other components .
it may not be used in patients who had a bleeding recently , as well as in people with severe high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection .
the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Company The Medi@@ c@@ ines Company UK Ltd approval for the transport of An@@ gi@@ ox in the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift attack ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or early intervention .
the recommended in@@ dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 0.1 mg / kg , followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is carried out in a further consequence , an additional bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours after the PCI .
immediately before the procedure , a value of 0.5 mg / kg should be given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention .
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI is an initial intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight and a subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
the safety and efficacy of any an@@ gi@@ ox bol@@ us application has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is reduced to less than 225 seconds , a second bol@@ us of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should take place .
in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted pharmaceutical should be carefully mixed prior to use and the bol@@ us dose should be administered intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1,@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate ren@@ al function ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subject to PCI ( whether treated with an ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is less than 225 seconds , a second bol@@ us dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bol@@ us dose to be checked again .
in patients with moderate ren@@ al damage , which were included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the administration of the Bi@@ vali@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dosage adjustment with an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe ren@@ al damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in patients with di@@ aly@@ sis , angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intraven@@ ous administration of frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular sciss@@ or .
• well @-@ known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or other ingredients or against hi@@ ru@@ dine • active bleeding or increased bleeding risk due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the hem@@ o@@ sta@@ as@@ es@@ ystems and / or ir@@ reversible ger@@ m distur@@ b@@ ance . • severe un@@ controlled hypertension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in patients with di@@ aly@@ sis .
patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if bi@@ vali@@ din is given in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if the majority of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges on arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sions occur in the case of PCI patients , patients who undergo a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) may occur throughout the treatment .
in patients receiving war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ ologi@@ cal@@ ine , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) should be taken into consideration to ensure that the value after sett@@ ling the treatment with bi@@ vali@@ din is again achieved prior to treatment .
based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tica or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggregates ) it can be assumed that these active agents increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ vali@@ din with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters are to be checked regularly .
the animal @-@ experimental studies are inadequate in relation to the effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , de@@ bonding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ din alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ en@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or .
in both the Bi@@ Vali@@ ru@@ din Group and the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over the age of 65 were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges were defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding like in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both light and heavy bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ - In@@ hibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ cran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , hem@@ at@@ oma with a diameter ≥ 5 cm at the point of pun@@ cture , reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in levels ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding point , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed bleeding loc@@ aliz@@ ations , which occurred with more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; point positions , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat .
the following information on side effects is based on data from a clinical study with a bi@@ vali@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ vali@@ din Group and in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over the age of 65 were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects that are not listed above have been reported in practice after comprehensive application and are group@@ ed according to system organ classes in Table 6 .
in the case of over@@ dosing , the treatment with a bi@@ vali@@ din should be stopped immediately and the patient is closely mes@@ hed with regard to signs of bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains bi@@ vali@@ din , a direct and specific Th@@ rom@@ bin@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both the cataly@@ tic centre and the ani@@ onic binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , irrespective of whether th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in is in the liquid phase or at cl@@ ots .
binding of bi@@ ologi@@ cal@@ ine to th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in , and thus its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in on the other hand slowly spl@@ its the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active centre of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in .
in addition , a plat@@ el@@ et @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) was induced .
in healthy volunteers and patients , Bi@@ Vali@@ ru@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is demonstrated by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if the patient subsequently had a PCI , an additional bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of Bi@@ vali@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1,@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ en@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with an inst@@ able ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST lift attack ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high risk patients who required angi@@ ography within 72 hours were distributed uni@@ form@@ ly over the 3 treatment arms .
about 77 % of patients had a recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EC@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent an angi@@ ography in 72 hours .

clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the use of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical properties of bi@@ vali@@ din were evaluated in patients undergoing a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) and in patients with ACS .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children aged six and up with diabetes requiring treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the upper arm inj@@ ected or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or to process the insulin effectively .
insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very margin@@ ally from the human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration than a short @-@ acting human@@ ising .
A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in people with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , where the body cannot work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed after six months ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % with human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other components , or in patients already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Germany GmbH a permit to transport A@@ pi@@ dra to the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the abdominal area , th@@ igh or delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdominal cavity .
because of the reduced glu@@ con@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , the insulin requirement in patients with a reduction of liver function can be reduced .
any change of the active strength , the brand ( manufacturer ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the method of production may result in a change in insulin requirements .
3 An inadequate dosage or abor@@ tion of a treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis . these states are potentially life threatening .
changing one patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change of dosage .
the timing of the occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change when changing the treatment scheme .
substances that increase blood sugar @-@ lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in con@@ ver@@ ting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ y@@ ramid , fi@@ br@@ ate , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , meth@@ amine oxid@@ ase , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ antibiotics .
in addition , symp@@ a@@ oly@@ tics such as beta @-@ block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and reser@@ pine may be weakened or absent .
animal @-@ experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin is transferred to human breast milk , but in general insulin does not occur in breast milk , nor is it absorbed after oral use .
listed below are the unwanted drug interactions known from clinical trials and group@@ ed according to the decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very often : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10.000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on the available data cannot be estimated ) .
cold wel@@ d@@ iness , cool and pale skin , ti@@ redness , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , lack of concentration , di@@ zz@@ iness , excessive hun@@ - ger , changes in vision , headache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy If the injection site is constantly changing within the injection area , a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy may occur at the injection site .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia with un@@ consciousness can be treated by means of an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , given by an appropriately trained person , or by an intraven@@ ous injection of glucose by a doctor .
after glu@@ cos@@ al injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake ( especially through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of Insul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the effect occurs faster and the time of action is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes , insulin sensitivity in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosage range from 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg showed a dose @-@ proportional dose @-@ bearing effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ al effect , just like human@@ ising .
insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the full glu@@ cos@@ al effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
from the data it became apparent that in an application of Insul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal a comparable Post Ab@@ den@@ di@@ ale gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , such as with a human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin sensitivity was taken 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ den@@ di@@ ale control was achieved than with a human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin is turned 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control such as in human normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ ds before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) , is achieved .
Insul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of meal in comparison to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1A ) and compared to a human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal in comparison to human nor@@ - mal@@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) .
