<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. entertain thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I disorder, a mental illness, in which the patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal sentiment) alternating with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased restlessness or behavioural problems if the oral ingestion of the medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">For both diseases, the solution can be used for taking or the melting tablets in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">For patients who take other medicines at the same time, which are broken down as well as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by" "" "neurotransmitters," "" "i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between nerve cells." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "Aripiprazole seems to be primarily a" "" "partial agonist" "" "for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin)." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole like 5 hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in less degree than the neurotransmitters works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">As dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole helps to normalize brain activity, thus reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing its recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies over up to a year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies of 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar disorders that had increased unrest over a period of two hours versus placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared over twelve weeks to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence in 160 patients with which the manic symptoms were already stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study involving 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from increased unrest, with that of Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in the symptoms of patients was examined using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution to take in (recording).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly greater reduction in the symptoms of increased unrest than the patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively in four of the five short-term studies than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, abilify prevented the recurrence of manic episodes of previously treated patients up to 74 weeks and was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo to relieve the symptoms of increased unrest and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (drowsiness), nausea (drowsiness), nausea, nausea, nausea, hypersecretion (increased saliva production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients with predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes were addressing the treatment with Aripiprazole were predominant.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in rapid control of increased unrest and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, if oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd approval for the marketing of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and discussed their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day, regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased efficacy in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">Considering the greater sensitivity of this group of patients, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4-inductor is removed from combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after initiation or replacement of anpsychotic therapy, even in treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no elevated suicidal risk with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overflow disturbances), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose to hypotony (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acrocelled and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials which lasted a year or less, occasional reports were reported about Dyskinesia during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If symptoms and symptoms of a late dyskinesia occur in a patient treated with Abilify, consideration should be taken to reduce the dose or break down treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that suggest a MNS or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions associated with seizures, Aripiprazl should be used with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis that are associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">There was, however, in one of these studies, a fixed dose study, a significant relationship between the dosage and response for undesirable cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no exact risk assessments for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyphony, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored with regard to a worsening of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary efficacy of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is required if Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines with overlying side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, decreases the rate of resorption of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'poor' (= "poor") metabolisation, the joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolites.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the joint gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, the potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV proteaseinase inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After setting the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dosage height before the start of the adjuvant therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6, together with Abilify, can be expected with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials dosages of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-method xymorphine-Ratio), 2C19 (warfarin), 2C19 (ommeprezol) and 3A4 (dextromethorphic).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data situation for safety in humans and due to concerns raised in the reproductive studies of animals, this medicine may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefits clearly justify the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other anti-psychotics, patients should be warned against using hazardous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more frequent (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: common (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - in a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks in patients treated with Aripiprazole, a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia were compared to patients treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with Aripiprazole treatment was 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole was 15.1% in patients with Olanzzapine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes of bipolar-I disorder - in a controlled study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23.5% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment was 53.3% in patients with haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients with Aripiprazole treatment was 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term recovery period over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment was 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups in Aripiprazole and Placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">CPK increases (creatine phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">The adverse events associated with anpsychotic therapy and their occurrence also reported in the treatment with Aripiprazole include maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in elderly people with dementia, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or deliberate overdosages with Aripiprazole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">There is no information about the efficacy of hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole; however, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is of benefit in the treatment of an overdose, since Aripiprazole has a high plasma retention.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder is mediated by the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">In vitro, Aripiprazole showed in vitro a high affinity to dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and for serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT1-, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine-H1Recireceptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In dosage of Aripiprazole in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks to healthy volunteers, positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of binding of 11C racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at the nucleus caudatus and on the putsch.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled study in week 52 was similar to the proportion of respondents who had a response to the study medication, similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measurement scales defined as secondary course targets including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- depression rate scale showed significantly greater improvement than with Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole showed a significantly higher rate of decline, which was 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzap controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study objective was' weight gain ', a weight gain of at least 7% was observed in significantly less patients (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazole showed a superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial for 3 weeks with fixed doses with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy trials for 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazole showed a efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Also in week 12, Aripiprazole showed a comparable percentage of patients with symptomatic remission of mania, such as lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which in part did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy with therapeutic serum levels, the companion therapy with Aripiprazole revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension period over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilization period before randomisation, Aripiprazole was superior to the prevention of a bipolar response, predominantly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for dehydration and hydroxyulation of Aripiprazole, the N-Dealkylamation is catalysed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole with extensive metabolites via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolites via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazl there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, nor did pharmacokinetic examination showed no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A specific analysis of pharmacokinetics showed no signs of clinically significant differences regarding ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetical properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with various liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect regarding liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions to their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety macropology, toxicity in repeated dosing, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data could not identify any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were only observed in doses or expositions which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent secondary kidney toxicity (Lipofuscin-Pigment-Accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans) and an increase of adrenal-kidney carcinomas and combined adrenal cortex adenomas / carcinomas (10 times the middle steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithiasis was detected as a result of the precipitation of sulfate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazole in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the recommended clinical dose or 16- to 81times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations of the sulfate-conjugate concentrations of Hydroxy- Aripiprazole found in the human gall at the highest recommended daily dose of Hydroxy- Aripiprazl found no more than 6% of the concentrations observed in the study over 39 weeks in the gall of monkeys and are far below the limit values (6%) of the in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">These effects were observed in rabbits following dosages which led to expositions of 3 and 11-times of the middle steady state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="144">Once clinically appropriate, the treatment should be terminated with Aripiprazole injection solution and commence with the oral application of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="145">To increase the absorption and to minimize variability, an injection into the M. deltoideus or deep into the gluteus maximus muscle is recommended under circumferring adipous regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) can be administered depending on the individual clinical status, taking into account the medicine used for maintenance or acute therapy (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a further oral treatment with Aripiprazole is indicated, see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to Abilify tablets, Abilify melting tablets or Abilify solution.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no studies on the efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution in patients with detoxicity and behavioural disorders, which were otherwise caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazole injection solution, patients should be observed with regard to extreme sedation or blood pressure drop (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Studies on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug toxicity (prescribed or illegal).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overflow disturbances), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose to hypotony (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acrocelled and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials which lasted a year or less, occasional reports were reported about Dyskinesia during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, muscle stiffness, changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and arrhythmia).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipsy, polyuric, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored regarding a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared to the dose of Aripiprazole in a study where healthy subjects were administered intramuscular (15 mg dose) and the same time lauazepam (2 mg dose) was intra-muscular.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, decreases the rate of resorption of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In CYP2D6 'poor' (= "poor") metabolisation, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole in comparison with CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Iconazole and HIV- proteaseinase inhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After setting the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dosage height before the start of the adjuvant therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intra-muscular was the intensity of sedation larger compared to that of Aripiprazole alone.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following side effects were more common in clinical trials with Aripiprazole injection solution (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria: common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">The following side effects were more frequent (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo, or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) in clinical trials (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment was 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment was 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term recovery period over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients suffering from Aripiprazole was 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups in Aripiprazole and Placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">CPK increases (creatinphosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">The adverse events associated with anpsychotic therapy and their occurrence also reported in the treatment with Aripiprazole include maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in elderly people with dementia, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders was the Aripiprazole injection solution associated with statistically significant improvements in atoxicity / behavioural disorders compared to placebo and was similar to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-time study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as atoxicity and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazole injection solution was associated with a statistically significant increase in the symptoms regarding the toxicity and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The observed average improvement from baseline value on the PANSS Excitement Component score was 5.8 for placebo, 9,6 for lauazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe aggibility, a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population, but a statistical significance could be detected because of a reduced number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole (orally) showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled study in week 52 was similar to the proportion of patients who had a response to the study medication, similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% (oral) and haloperidol (73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measurement scales defined as secondary course targets, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg-depression rate scale, showed significantly greater improvement than with Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole (oral) showed a significantly higher rate of decline, which was 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an Olanzap controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study objective was' weight gain ', a weight gain of at least 7% was observed in significantly less patients (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which in part did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy with therapeutic serum levels, the companion therapy with Aripiprazole revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study for 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study extension in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilisation phase, Aripiprazole was superior to placebo in view of the prevention of bipolar decline, predominantly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">In the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection, the Aripiprazole AUC is 90% bigger the AUC after the dose of the same dose as a tablet; the systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers, the mean time until reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The gift of Aripiprazole injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated dosing in systemic exposure (AUC), which was 15- and 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra-muscular.</seg>
<seg id="185">Studies on reproductive toxicity after intravenous application did not concern safety-relevant concerns after maternal exposure, which was 15- (rats) and 29-times (rabbits) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with Aripiprazole (oral) for safety macropology, toxicity in repeated dosing, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data could not detect any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were only observed in doses or expositions which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans; thus, they have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent secondary kidney toxicity (Lipofuscin-Pigment-Accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans) and an increase of adrenal-kidney carcinomas and combined adrenal-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, a cholelithiasis was detected as a result of the precipitation of sulfate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazole in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the recommended clinical dose or 16- to 81 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="190">In rabbits, these effects were observed following dosages which led to expositions of 3 and 11-times the middle steady-state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, of which about three quarters of previously had an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in sole administration or as monotherapy) was compared with a medicine containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">In the main study 72 (31%) of the 229 patients treated with Abraxane responded to the treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients who received conventional paclitaxel medicines.</seg>
<seg id="270">In view of only those who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference between the efficacy indicators such as time to the worsening of the disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">On the other hand, patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer were aware of these indicators that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It must also not be used in patients that breastfeed or have low neutrophils in their blood prior to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) found that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel in patients where the first treatment was not more effective than conventional paclitaxel drugs, and that in contrast to other paclitaxel drugs it does not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Abraxis BioScience Limited for the marketing of Abraxane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane-Monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients receiving first-line treatment for metastatic disease and which is not indicated for a standard anthracycline-containing therapy (see also section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophils number &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series.</seg>
<seg id="277">Sensory neuropathy C 3 is used to interrupt the treatment until an improvement is reached to degree 1 or 2, and with all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="278">There is currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adjustment in patients with mild to moderate liver function impairment (see section 4.4. and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="279">There were no studies with patients with impaired kidney function and there are currently no sufficient data to recommend dosage adjustment in patients with impaired kidney function (see section 5.2).</seg>

<seg id="283">In patients no new abrasion treatment cycles should be initiated until the number of neutrophytonics has risen to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the platelet number has risen to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver function disorders (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">While a clearly identified cardiotoxicity associated with Abraxane has not been proven, cardiac occurrences in the indicated patient population are not unusual, especially in patients with previous anthracycline treatment or underlying heart or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">In case patients after the treatment of Abraxane nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, they can be treated with the usual anti-emetics and constitial means.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used in pregnant women or in childbearing age, who do not practice an effective contraception, except the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel is inevitable.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should use a reliable contraceptive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients treated with Abraxane will be advised not to bear children during and up to six months after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised of a sperm conservation before the treatment, because the possibility of irreversible infertility is due to the treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as tiredness (very often) and dizziness (frequent), which can affect the transport efficiency and ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and most important cases of side effects that occured in 229 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma, which were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in the pivotal phase III trial.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most eye-catching hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anaemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of the patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 lists the side effects associated with the dose of Abraxane as monotherapy at each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10.000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: elevated blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate hydrogenase in the blood, elevated creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, flatulence, tongue burning, dry mouth, pain in gums, loose stools, oesophagitis, pain in the lower abdomen, ulcers in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of muscles, neck pain, abdominal pain, muscle spasms, pain in skeletal muscles, flank pain, discomfort in limbs, muscle weakness Very often:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive in relation to a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no causal connection with these events has been established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an anti-microtubules active agent that promotes the deposition of microtubules from the tubules and stabilises microtubules by inhibiting their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization results in inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubular network essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin conveys the transcytosis of plasma components into endothelial cells and in in-vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of Paclitaxel through endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 albumin receptor and a paclitaxel accumulation occurs in the area of the tumor due to the albumin protein acidic rich in cysteine.</seg>
<seg id="306">The use of Abraxane for metastatic breast carcinoma is supported by data from 106 patients in two single-arm non-faded studies and 454 patients treated in a randomized Phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In one study, 43 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion of more than 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multi-center study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma, which received a monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in the form of solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 compared to an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion with no pre-medication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had a compromised general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had previously received chemotherapy, 27% had only one adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only for metastatic and 19% for metastatic disease and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The outcomes for the overall response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First Line therapy are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement by one degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy degree 3 at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy to sound baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the overall paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusion of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was measured in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">Exposure to active substances (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736ng.h / ml, analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 According to the intravenous dose of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the plasma concentration of paclitaxel decreased in a multiphase way.</seg>
<seg id="318">The mean distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume points to a far-reaching extravascularity of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with patients with advanced solid tumours, Paclitaxel's pharmacokinetical properties were compared with an intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane with the values following a 3 hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearance of Paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane injection (43%) than after a solvent containing paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">Published literature on in vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers is reported that paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma, the mean value for the cumulative flow of active substances was 4% of the total metabolite 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, suggesting a far-reaching non-renal clearing.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data is available about patients at the age of more than 75 years, since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetical analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">The chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and in light of light over 8 hours.</seg>
<seg id="325">Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anticarcinogenic medicine and, as with other potentially toxic substances, caution should be observed when dealing with Abraxane.</seg>

<seg id="359">"" "this means that Abseamed is similar to a biological drug which is already approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same active substance (also called" "" "reference drug" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood vessels, which could occur in connection with a blood transfusion complications, if a blood donation is not possible prior to the procedure and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with Abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in treating patients with illnesses for which the medicine is shown.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own blood donation, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be done by the patient or his supervisor, provided they have received appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the haemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients must be checked before the treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency and iron supplements should be given during the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia can be caused by an erythropoietin deficiency or by the fact that the body does not adequately address the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus to reduce the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which it empowers to the formation of epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared with the reference drug used as an injection into a vein as part of a major study involving 479 patients who suffered from kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study were injected at least eight weeks Eprex / Erypo in a vein before they either amed down or retained Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of the efficacy was the change in hemoglobin values between the start of the study and the evaluation period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of streamed down under the skin were studied with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients who suffered from kidney problems, the hemoglobin levels of patients who were treated to Abseamed were maintained to the same extent as in those patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, the patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0,063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, smelling migraine-like headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed must not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="377">Unseamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that for Abseamed in accordance with the European Union regulations, evidence was provided that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that has amed Abseamed will provide information packages for medical professionals across all member states, including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>

<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of transfusion is due to the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, preexisting anaemia at the onset of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">The treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate anemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8.1 mmol / l], no iron deficiency) if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, in the case of planned larger operations which require large blood volume (4 or more units of blood for women; 5 or more units of blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">Abseamed can be used to reduce external blood loss before major elective orthopaedic intervention in adults with no iron deficiency, in which a high risk of transfusion complications can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml can be applied that cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">Hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for pediatric patients where hemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms and tortures may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease burden; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the physician.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in hemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can occasionally be observed in a patient above or below the haemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent hemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is applied in the lowest permitted dose required to control anaemia and anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">The clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">These clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4,25 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4,25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Start dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week by intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms of anemia and - follow-up may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease burden; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the physician.</seg>
<seg id="396">In view of this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is applied at the lowest permitted dose required for control of the anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 weeks of treatment the hemoglobin value is increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the reticulocyte number by ≥ 40.000 cells / µl compared to the baseline value, the dose of 150 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the hemoglobin increase of &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the reticulocyte number of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl is increased compared to the initial value, the dose should be increased to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.U. / kg three times a week the haemoglobin value is increased by ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the reticulocyte number by ≥ 40.000 cells / µl, the dose of 300 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the hemoglobin value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) or the reticulocyte number by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, a response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anaemia (hematocrit 33 - 39%), which require the precautionary storage of ≥ 4 blood vessels, should be protected twice a week for 3 weeks before surgical procedure at a dose of 600 I.U. / kg of body weight.</seg>
<seg id="403">Iron substitution should be started as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the autologous blood donation program commences so that large iron reserves are available before the beginning of the seamed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg of epoetin alfa, which should be given once a week over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of engagement (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">In this case, epoetin alfa should be preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg on 10 consecutive days, on the day of the surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection at the end of dialysis can be given via the hose of a fistula, followed by 10 ml isotonic saline solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injections of the medicine into circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients diagnosed with any erythropoetin at an erythroblastoenie (Pure Red Cell Apolsia, PRCA) should not be released or another erythropoetin (see section 4.4 - erythroblastoenie).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within one month prior to treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous rombosis (e.g. venous venous thromboembollies).</seg>
<seg id="409">The use of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in the following pre-, accompanying or basic diseases: severe coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, vascular disease of the carotides or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with a recently occurred heart attack or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastoenia (PRCA) Very rarely reported about the appearance of an anti-body-mediated PRCA after months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of activity, defined as reduction of haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the reticence value should be determined and the usual causes for failure (folic acid, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminescence, infection or inflammation, blood loss and hemolysis) should be investigated.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the reticulocyte value, taking into account anaemia (i.e. the Retiulocyte "Index"), is lower (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 20,000 / Microliter or &lt; 0.5%), the anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone marrow for diagnosis of a PRCA should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="413">Data on immunogenicity in cutaneous use of Abseamed in patients with a risk of an anti-body induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration recommended under Section 4.2 should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials an increased risk of mortality and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed if erythropoesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a haemoglobin target concentration of over 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit, which is due to the gift of epoetines when the hemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration needed to control angiogenic symptoms and avoidance of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The hemoglobin increase should be approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinically evident coronary heart disease or congestive heart failure, the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration recommended under Section 4.2 should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are not yet dialysis, does not accelerate the progression of the renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">For tumour patients under chemotherapy, a 2-3-week delay between epoetin alfa and erythropoetin response should be considered for the assessment of the therapeutic efficiency of epoetin alfa (patients who need to be transacted).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase exceeds 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment involving the respective patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients foreseen for greater elective orthopaedic surgery, the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated appropriately before the onset of epoetin alfa therapy.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate thromboseprophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially for underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be ruled out that treatment with epoetin alfa could be an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular events for patients with an output level of &gt; 13 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled studies, epoetine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anaemia or decrease the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy, if hemoglobin target concentration was targeted at 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l)</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporindose should be adapted to the increasing haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies of tumor tissues no evidence indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">About thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemia, cerebrovascular events (cerebral haemorrhage, cerebral infarction), transitory thrombosis, pulmonary thrombosis, pulmonary thrombosis, retinal thromboses, aneurysms, retinal thromboses and 11 blood clots were reported in patients with epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during the treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the worsening of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascular events (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients with erythropoetine treatment.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of erythropoetin treatment, surgical patients with a cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations can lead to thrombotic and vascular complications.</seg>
<seg id="434">The genetic engineering epoetin alfa is glycosified and is identical with the endogenous human erythropoietin, which was isolated from the urine of anamic patients with respect to the amino acids and the carbohydrate portion.</seg>

<seg id="568">It is used in patients with a high fracture risk (fractures), including in patients who have recently suffered a traumatic hip fracture as in the case of chiefall; • Morbus Paget of the bone, a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth.</seg>
<seg id="569">In addition, patients with Morbus Paget should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment; before the first infusion patients should receive a large dose of vitamin D (50 000 to 125,000 IE) orally or by injection into a muscle.</seg>
<seg id="570">The administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen (remedy against inflammation) shortly after the application of Aclasta can reduce symptoms such as fever, muscle pain, flu-like symptoms, joint pain and headaches in the three days after infusion.</seg>

<seg id="575">In the case of Morbus Paget, Aclasta was tested in two studies on a total of 357 patients and compared with risedronate (another bisphosphonate) for six months.</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicator of the efficacy was whether the content of alkaline phosphatase in serum (an enzyme that decomposes bone substance) in the blood again normalized or decreased by at least 75% compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study involving older women, the risk of spinal fractures in patients under Aclasta (without other osteoporosis medicines) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="578">The risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41% compared to all patients under Aclasta (with or without other osteoporosis medicines).</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study with men and women with hip fracture, 9% of patients under Aclasta had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of patients under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most of the side effects of Aclasta occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Zoledron acid or other bisphosphonate or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients with Aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to the infusion and osteoarthritis (loss of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The Aclasta manufacturer provides information for doctors who prescribe aclasta for the treatment of osteoporosis, which contains information about how the medicine is used and similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor.</seg>

<seg id="587">The patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include: • Adcontraindication in pregnancy and in nursing women • Required for adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non-smoking and a healthy diet • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing assistance</seg>
<seg id="588">Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including in patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men an intravenous infusion of 5 mg Aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">Patients with a low-traumatic acetabular fracture are recommended to use the infusion of Aclasta two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclasta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">Following a treatment of the Paget with Aclasta, a long remission period was observed in patients who responded to treatment (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient calcium intake in patients with Morbus Paget twice daily for at least 500mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recent low-traumatic fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by means of paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney function disorder (see section 4.4) In patients with a Kreatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended as limited clinical experience exists for this group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="597">Older patients (≥ 65 years) A dosage adjustment is not necessary because the bioavailability, distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Aclasta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age, as data on harmlessness and efficacy is missing.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure (Creatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min), since only limited clinical experience exists for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Prior to the onset of treatment with Aclasta, preexisting hypokalemia is to be treated by adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the quick insertion of the effect of Zoledronic acid on the bone structure, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia develops, whose maximum occurs normally within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclasta (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient calcium intake in patients with Morbus Paget twice daily for at least 500 mg. of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the Aclasta gift (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene) should be considered with appropriate preventive dentistry prior to the use of bisphosphonates.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are no data available for patients who need dental procedures, whether the interruption of treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteoporosis in the jaw region.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of Aclasta can be reduced by the administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The frequency of cases of atrial fibrillation reported as serious adverse events was increased in patients receiving Aclasta (1.3%) (51 of 3.862) compared to placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">The overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable in the osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]).</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 10), frequent (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse drug interactions are listed in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Renal dysfunction Zoledronics was associated with renal dysfunctions associated with decrease of the renal function (i.e. an increase in serum creatine) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the Creatinin Clearance (measured annually before the administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a restricted renal function were in a clinical trial for osteoporosis over three years compared to the Aclasta- and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatine within 10 days of therapy was observed at 1.8% of patients treated with aclasta compared to 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium levels below the normal fluctuation range (less than 2.10 mmol / l) occurred in 2.3% of patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical trial compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the Morbus Paget studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the postmenopausal osteoporosis study, in the study to prevent clinical fractures after a hip fracture and in the Morbus Paget studies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a recently littled hip fracture, the vitamin D mirrors were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions following the administration of Zoledron acid in a large clinical study were reported on local reactions at the infusion site, such as redness, swelling and / or pain (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonecrosis in the maxillofacial area has been reported, especially in cancer patients, about osteonecrosis (primarily in the jaw area), which were treated with bisphosphonates, including Zoledron acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and the majority of reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental interventions.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 patients with 7,736 patients treated osteoarthritis in the jaw area with aclasta and placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the case of overdosing, which leads to clinically relevant hypokalemia, a compensation of oral calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate can be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical effectiveness in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown with either a bone density value (BMD) -T-Score for the Schenkelheck ≤ -1.5 and at least two mild or a moderate-heavy existing spine fracture or a BMD T-Score for the Schenkelheck ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing spine fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometrical vertebral fractures were significantly lowered over a period of three years and the frequency of one or more new vertebral fractures after a year (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta-treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60% reduced risk of vertebral fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on aclasta hip fractures yielded an equally lasting effect over three years, which resulted in a reduced risk of hip fractures by 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased bone density at lumbar vertebrac acid, hip and distal radius compared to placebo treatment at all time points (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase of the bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the whole thigh by 6.0%, the lower thigh by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">In 152 Postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70), a year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies from the pelvis.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed patients treated with aclasta compared to placebo an increase in trabecular bone volume and the preservation of trabecular bone architecture.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone replacement markers The bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminale propeptide of the type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C-Telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periods of study duration.</seg>
<seg id="630">The treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Aclasta significantly reduced BSAP by 30% compared to baseline and was kept at 28% below the baseline value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the baseline value after 12 months and was held at 52% below the baseline value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the baseline after 12 months and was kept at 55% below the baseline value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">Vitamin D levels were not measured routinely, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50.000 to 125.000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular) 2 weeks prior to infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">The total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta, compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT study, the BMD increased the BMD at all time points compared to placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Aclasta treatment led to an increase in BMD by 5.4% compared to placebo treatment by 5.4% compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON-RFT study, 508 men were randomized and in 185 patients the BMD was assessed after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in men's clinical fractures; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in Aclasta-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308), the once annual dose of Aclasta compared to the once weekly dose of alendronate was not inferior to the percentage change in lumbar vertebrae BMD after 24 months compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical effectiveness of the treatment at the Paget of the bone Aclasta has been studied in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radiologically confirmed, mainly light to moderately difficult Morbus Paget of the bone (mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase according to the 2,6x to 3,0fold age-specific upper average for inclusion in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg of zoledron acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of risedronate once a day for 2 months was demonstrated in two six months comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain and pain intensity was observed after 6 months compared to the baseline for aclasta and risedronate.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as Responsibilities at the end of the six month trial could be included in an observational phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 patients treated with aclasta and the 107 patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic approach of 141 patients with aclasta, compared to 71 patients treated with Risedipus, could be maintained at an average duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-time and multiple 5 and 15 minute infusion of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of zoledron folic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetical data which proved to be dosisindependent.</seg>
<seg id="646">Thereafter, the plasma level quickly increased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h, followed by a long lasting phase very low concentration, not more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic removal from the large cycle with half-life t ½ α 0,24 and t ½ β 1.87 hours, followed by a long elimination period with a terminal elimination period t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early phases of distribution (α and β, with the above 1 ½ -values) presumably represent the rapid absorption into the bones and excretion over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly bonded to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body-clearance amounts to 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by sex, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Zoledron concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration at time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished clearance of metabolized substances by Cytochrom-P450 enzymes is unlikely, because Zoledron acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, substance-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal clearance of the cioledron-acid correlated with the Kreatinin-Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the Creatinin-Clearance, and in the 64 examined patients in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a slight (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate renal dysfunction down to a creatinin-clearing up to 35 ml / min no dosage adjustment of the zoledron acid required.</seg>
<seg id="655">Because there is only limited data for severe kidney function disorder (Kreatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min), no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest single-acting intravenous single dose in mice amounted to 10 mg / kg of body weight and at rats 0,6 mg / kg of body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In the case of studies in dogs, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC the 6fold of recommended human-therapeutic exposure) were administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Chronic and chronic toxicity in trials involving intravenous application was given the renal tolerability of Zoledron acid in rats, taking doses of 0.6 mg / kg as 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, ranging in intervals of 2- 3 weeks (a cumulative dose corresponding to the 7x of the human-therapeutic exposure, related to the AUC,).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated application for cumulative exposures exceeding the maximum of planned human exposure, toxicological effects on other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, and the intravenous injection point, occurred.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most frequent finding in trials with repeated use was an increased primary spontaneity in the metaphysis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dosages, an infestation that reflects the pharmacological, antiresorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats observed teratogenicity at dosages of 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal (visceral) abnormalities and such a skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although maternal toxicity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of low serum calcium levels.</seg>

<seg id="672">Declining blood levels of sex hormones, especially estrogens that are formed from androgens, play a role in the gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">At the Morbus Paget, the bone structure is too fast, and new bone material is insubordinate, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta works by normalising bone structure, guaranteeing a normal bone formation and thus giving the bone strength again.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) evaluated the studies conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially obese patients) in which metformin (a diabetes medication) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">Metformin can also be used in patients (especially obese patients) who cannot be adequately configured with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonyl harnin or insulin, the previous dose of the sulfonyl resin or insulin can be maintained with the onset of the Actos treatment, except in patients with hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of the sulfonyl resin or insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases, making type 2 diabetes better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of actos in tripletherapy was studied; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonyl resin, in addition they received either actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, suggesting that the blood sugar levels were reduced in the application of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg doses.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the trial study, the effect of an additional dose of Actos for existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonyl harnin decreased by 0.94%, while the additional dose of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study investigating the combination of actos and insulin in 289 patients, the patients who took Actos in addition to insulin had a reduction of HbA1c values from 0.69% after 6 months compared to 0.14% in the patients who received additional placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were visual disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypothaesthesia (decreased sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos can neither be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or any of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone levels - acid levels - in blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited an approval for Actos "placing in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">"" "the tablets are white to whitish, round, arched and carry on one side the mark" "" "15" "" "and on the other hand the wording" "" "Actos" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and where metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For the use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years no data is available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. early heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with Pioglitazone in patients less than 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced advanced macular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study there was an increase in reports of heart failure, which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver enzymatic values (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range, the liver enzyme levels are to be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that point to a hepatic dysfunction such as unresolved nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, liver enzyme levels are to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether to continue the treatment of patients with Pioglitazone should be guided by clinical assessment until the laboratory parameters have been passed.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with Pioglitazone, a dose-dependent weight gain has been proven that can stem from fatty deposits and in some cases is associated with fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of hemodilution, minor hemoglobin (relative reduction by 4%) and hematokrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred under the therapy with Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative studies with Pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4% and hematokrits by 3.1% and hematokrits by 1-2% and hematokrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity in patients receiving pioglitazone as oral secondary or triple combination therapy with a sulfonyl harnin or as two-cell combination therapy with insulin, the risk of a dose-dependent hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch a reduction of visual acuity was reported under the treatment with thiazolide india, including Pioglitazone, an incidence or worsening of diabetic macular edema.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is not clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema. however, prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular edema if patients report disorders of visual acuity; an appropriate ophthalmological evaluation should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of 3,5 years of study of cardiovascular events, fractures of 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with Pioglitazone were compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment is to be dismissed (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the interactions have shown that Pioglitazone does not have any relevant effects on the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamics of digoxine, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors cannot be expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a Cytochrom P450 2C8- Inhibitor) resulted in an increase of the AUC of Pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a 54% reduction in the AUC of Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that under treatment with Pioglitazone, the hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal are reduced and the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fetal growth is reduced.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very often &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 10000, very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (not estimable from this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turgor and the refractive index of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycaemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with Pioglitazone, ALT ascents exceeding three times the upper limit of the normal range were equally common as placebo, but less often than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonyl resin.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with advanced advanced macular vascular disease, the incidence of severe heart failure under pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than placebo, when Pioglitazone or Pioglitazone respectively.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch has rarely been reported about cardiac insufficiency under Pioglitazone, however, if Pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with congestive heart failure in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of reports of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with Pioglitazone and more than 7,400 patients were performed in the groups treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive study, which lasted over a period of 3.5 years, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days did not appear any symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to have an activation of specific nuclear receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator-activated Receptor-γ (PPAR-γ)), which in the animal model leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be demonstrated that Pioglitazone reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose rating in the event of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazone versus Glicentidal as monotherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time of two years after the onset of the therapy, blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by Pioglitazone in 69% of treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Glicenticide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study of over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was inadequate despite a three-month optimization phase were randomized to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients suffering from Pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c decreased by 0.45% compared to the patients who still received only insulin; a reduction of insulin dosage in the treated group treated with Pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, pioglitazone consistently showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin quotient compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18-week study of type 2 diabetes patients.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, compared to placebo, a reduction in overall plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- cholesterol levels as well as slight, but clinically not significantly elevated LDL cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced the total polyglycerides and free fatty acids compared to placebo, metformin or bile, and increased HDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was observed under Pioglitazone, while values decreased in metformin and colic acid.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone not only reduced the intimidity triglycerides, but also improved the posterior elevated triglyceride level, which has an effect on triglyceride absorption as well as the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced advanced macular vascular disease were randomized to groups who received either Pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazone is absorbed quickly, with the peak concentrations of immutable pioglitazone in the plasma usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV to efficacy is equivalent to three times the effectiveness of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies it was proven that Pioglitazone does not have a relevant effect on the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamics of digoxine, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrom P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral use of radioactively marked Pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in rotting (55%) and to a lesser extent in urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma-elimination period of unchanged pioglitazone amounts to 5-6 hours in humans and the total active metabolites are 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of Pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced renal function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of the oral clearances of the mother substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies mice, rats, dogs and monkeys converged with repeated administration of plasma volume increase with hemodilution, anaemia and reversible, eccentric heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that under treatment with Pioglitazone, the hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal are reduced and the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fetal growth is reduced.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), increased incidence of hyperplasia (male and female rats) and tumors (in male rats) of the bladder epithelium were induced in rats.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other thiazolide indions led to increased frequency of colon tumors.</seg>

<seg id="823">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of 3,5 years of study of cardiovascular events, fractures of 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with Pioglitazone were compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study more than two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with Pioglitazone or Gliclactate were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials more than 1 year, Pioglitazone consistently showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin quotient compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone not only reduced the intimidity triglycerides, but also improved the posterior elevated triglyceride level, which has an effect on tryglyceride absorption as well as hepatic tryglicerides synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study missed the target of their primary endpoint, which represented a combination of the total mortality, non-mortal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankle, coronary vascularisation and vascularisation of the leg arteries, the results suggest that there are no cardiovascular long-term risks associated with taking Pioglitazone.</seg>

<seg id="866">Actrophane resulted in a decrease in the HbA1c mirror, suggesting that blood sugar levels were reduced similarly to another humanising insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, the doses of Actrophane may be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar (see the complete list of packages).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Actrophane were predominant in the treatment of diabetes.</seg>

<seg id="1322">Fit consisted of two placebo-controlled studies where alendronate was taken daily (5 mg. daily over 2 years and thereafter 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years):</seg>
<seg id="1323">In this study, the daily dose of alendronate reduced the occurrence of at least one new eddy fraction by 47% (Alendronate 7.9% vs placebo 15.0%).</seg>
<seg id="1324">Resorption: the mean oral bioavailability of alendronate in women was 0.64% for doses between 5 and 70 mg after night fasting and two hours before starting a standardised breakfast.</seg>

<seg id="1326">In osteoporosis, alendronate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drinking of the day.</seg>
<seg id="1327">In healthy volunteers, the administration of oral prednisone (20 mg three times daily over five days) led to no clinically meaningful change in the oral bioavailability of alendronate (increase in the range from 20% to 44%).</seg>
<seg id="1328">9 Distribution studies in rats have shown that alendronate is temporarily distributed in soft tissue after intravenous administration of 1 mg / kg, but then quickly dispersed into the bone or excreted with the urine.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Expulsion After IV dosing of a single dose of 14C-Alendronate about 50% of the radioactively selected substance was excreted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radioactivity was found in the rottence.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Following intravenous administration of a single dose of 10 mg, the renal clearance of alendronate was 71 ml / min and systemic clearances did not exceed 200 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="1331">In rats, alendronate is not excreted via the acid or alkaline transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that the excretion of other drugs is influenced by these transport systems in humans.</seg>

<seg id="1336">Characteristics in patients with preclinical studies have shown that the proportion of alendronate, which is not deposited in the bone, is quickly excreted via the urine.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Although no clinical data is available, it is expected that the renal elimination of alendronate as well as in animal experiments will also be reduced in patients with reduced renal function.</seg>
<seg id="1338">For this reason, in patients with reduced renal function, a somewhat higher accumulation of alendronate in the bone is to be expected (see section 4.2).</seg>

<seg id="1402">As tacrolimus and prograf / prograft are already used in the EU, the company has presented the results from previously conducted studies with Prograf / Prograft as well as data from published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1403">In addition, the results of a clinical study were presented to 668 patients with kidney transplant, comparing Advanagraf with Prograf / Prograft or Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1404">The main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients in which the graft was repelled after a treatment duration of one year (for example, by examining how often a new organ transplant or resumption of dialysis was necessary).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, shorter follow-up studies were conducted on 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplant and examined how advagraph is absorbed by the body compared to Prograf / Prograft.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only physicians who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and the treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tacrolimus, this may lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects, including under- or immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; changes of the formulation or regime should only be performed under close supervision of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of a changeover to an alternative formulation, therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advanagraf should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases and on blood level provisions (see "Recommendations").</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograf to Advanf, the tacrolimus level mirrors should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On day 4, systemic exposure, measured as a level mirror, was comparable to both kidney and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of tacrolimus level are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation in advance to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate re-transplant phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Because tacrolimus is a low-legged substance, an adjustment of the dose can take several days until the steady state is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1419">If the patient's condition in the first postoperative period does not allow oral ingestion of medicines, the Tacrolimus treatment can be initiated intravenously (Prograf 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an infusion fluid) with a dose of ca.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Duration of the application For suppression of graft rejection, immunosuppression must be maintained; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dosage recommendations - renal transplantation Prophylaxis of transplant rejection The oral Advanagraf therapy should start with 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dosage adjustment can be required later, as the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus can change in the course of the patient's stabilisation following the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dose recommendations - liver transplant Prophylaxis of transplant rejection The oral Advanagraf therapy should start with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - conversion from Prograf to Advanf must be changed a transplant recipient of twice daily dosage of Prograf capsules to a once daily intake of advagraf, so this conversion has to take place in proportion 1: 1 (mg: mg), relative to the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Renal and liver transplantation After switching from other immunosuppressants to advagraf once a day, the treatment with the recommended oral initial dose for prophylaxis of transplant rejection must begin once a day.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplant In adult patients who are transplanted to advagraph, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is to be taken once a day.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients, although there is no clinical experience with Advantages in lung, pancreatic and ectal transplant patients, occurred in an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day, in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in intestinal transplant recipients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function For the maintenance of blood levels in the targeted area, a reduction of the dose may be required in patients with severe liver dysfunctions.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced renal function Since the renal function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, however, a careful supervision of the renal function (including a regular determination of serum increment levels, a calculation of the creatine in the urine and a monitoring of the urine volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Changeover from Ciclosporin to Advanf When switching from a Ciclosporin to a tacrolimus-based therapy caution is required (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">The dose should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases, with the aid of thoroughbred Tacrolimus-Talking-controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to carry out frequent checks of tacrolimus level levels during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood sebaceous levels of tacrolimus should also be checked after conversion from prograf to advagraf, dose adjustment, changes in immunosuppressant therapy or, at the same time, application of substances that could alter the tacrolimus full blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">As Advanf is a low-legged drug, adjustments to the dose may require several days until the steady state has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">Clinical studies indicate that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, in the first period of the liver transplantations, tacrolimus Talgs are usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and kidney and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects caused by tacrolimus under- or over-exposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; changes of the formulation or regime should only be performed under close supervision of a physician experienced in the transplant (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be refractory contrary to other immunosuppressants, there are still no clinical data for the retardated Advantf formulation.</seg>
<seg id="1442">In order to prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplant recipients and transplant recipients, no clinical data are available for the retardated Advanagraf formulation.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the tacrolimus level in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or other plant remedies during a treatment with advagraph (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful supervision of the Tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is required, as the Tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to considerable variations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, ventric or septic hypertrophy, known as cardiomyopathy, was observed in Prograf, which can therefore also occur under Advanagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, fluid overload and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the possible risk of maligent skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a sun protection agent with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who take tacrolimus symptoms for PRES such as headaches, altered state of consciousness, convulsions and visual disturbances, should be a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and therefore increase or lower the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels while adding substances that can alter the CYP3A's metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dosage for maintaining uniform concentrations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly pronounced interaction with antimykotika such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, Itraconazole and Voriconazole as well as with the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z.</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus, caused by the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methyl prednisolone, as used in case of acute rejection reactions, can increase or decrease the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">Effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other drugs Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitors; therefore, the simultaneous application of tacrolimus with medicines that are metabolized by CYP3A4 can affect their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since tacrolimus can reduce the Clearance of steroid-contraceptives and thus increase the hormone level, decisions about contraceptive measures must be particularly careful.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that tacrolimus can potentially reduce the Clearance of pentobarbital and phenazone and prolong their half-life time.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of transplant patients do not provide evidence that tacrolimus compared to other immunosuppressants is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and result of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In utero exposure, supervision of the newborn is recommended for possible damaging effects of tacrolimus (especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys).</seg>
<seg id="1460">There is the risk of premature birth (&lt; week 37) and hyperescalation of the newborn (incidence 8 of 111 newborns, i.e.:</seg>

<seg id="1465">Infection and parasitic diseases As well known in other highly effective immunosuppressants, patients who are treated with tacrolimus are often increased susceptibility to infections (viral, bacterial, mycotic, protozoal).</seg>
<seg id="1466">Cases of the BK-Virus-associated Nephropathy and JC-Virus-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) were reported in patients with immunosuppression therapy, including treatment with Advanagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1467">Benign or malignant neoplasms including EBV- associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumours were reported in connection with the treatment with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high binding of erythrocytes and plasma proteins, tacrolimus cannot be dialyzed.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Mechanisms of action and pharmacodynamic effects At the molecular level, the effects of tacrolimus are likely to be mediated by its binding to a cytosol protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for the enrichment of the connection in the cell innner.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciumdependent inhibition of signal transduction pathways in the T cell, preventing the transcription of a certain number of lymphocytic genes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus oppresses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T-helper cells, and the formation of lymphocytes (such as interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and γ-interferon) as well as the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="1472">12 confirmed acute rejection was 32.6% within the first 24 weeks of the advance group (N = 237) and 29.3% in the prograf group (N = 234).</seg>

<seg id="1474">Kidney transplantation The efficacy and safety of Advanagraf and Prograf was compared in combination with mycophenolatmofetil (MMF) and corticosteroids, in 667 de novo kidney transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The survival rates after 12 months were 96.9% for Prograf and 97.5% for prograf; in the Advanf Arm 10 (3 women, 7 men) and in prograf arm 8 (3 women, 5 men) occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1476">Efficacy and safety of Prograf, Ciclosporin and Advanf was compared in combination with Basiliximab-antibody-induction, MMF and corticosteroids, in 638 de novo kidney transplant receivers.</seg>
<seg id="1477">Incidence of therapy failure after 12 months (defined as death, graft rejection, biopsy confirmed acute rejection or missing follow-up data) was 14.0% in the advance group (N = 214), 15.1% in the prograf group (N = 212) and 17.0% in the Ciclosporin group (N = 212).</seg>
<seg id="1478">The treatment difference was -3.0% (95.2% confidence interval [-9.9%, 4.0%]) for Advanf vs Ciclosporin and -1.9% (Prograf Ciclosporin) (95.2% confidence interval [-8.9%, 5.2%]) for Prograf vs Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1479">In advance, 3 (men), in prograf arm 10 (3 women, 7 men) and in Ciclosporin arm 6 (3 women, 3 men) occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1480">Published results of the primary immunosuppression with Tacrolimus in the form of twice daily prograf capsules after other primary organ transplantations Prograf has evolved into a recognised primary immunosuppressant after pancreatic, lung and intestinal transplants.</seg>
<seg id="1481">In 630 cases, patients who had undergone a pancreatic transplantation were treated as primary immunosuppressant in 630 cases.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral prograf was consistent with these published studies in the studies in which prograf was used for primary immunosuppression in liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted, multi-center study with oral prograf, more than 110 patients were reported to receive either tacrolimus or Ciclosporin within a 1: 1 randomisation.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic graft rejection, bronchiolitis obliterans- syndrome was less frequent in the first year after transplantation (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the Tacrolimus and 83% in the Ciclosporin group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract # 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">Patients treated with tacrolimus were found in 21.7% of cases of bronchiolitis obliterans compared to 38.0% below Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases where Ciclosporin had to be changed to tacrolimus (n = 13) was significantly greater (p = 0.02) than the number of patients who were killed by tacrolimus on Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which no acute graft rejection occurred was increased after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in the patients of the Tacrolimus patients (Treede et al., J Heart Lung transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In one study the frequency of developing a bronchiolitis obliterans- syndroms was significantly lower in patients treated with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Pancreatic transplantation A multicenter study with oral prograf was performed in 205 patients undergoing pancreatic and renal transplantation based on a randomised procedure tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initial dose (per protocol) of tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then achieved to achieve the desired level of 8 to 15 ng / ml am 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The published clinical results of a monocentric study with oral prograf as primary immunosuppressant after intestinal grafts showed an updated survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Methods for early detection of Epstein-Barr (EBV) and CMV infections, bone marrow enlargement, additional gift of interleukin-2 antagonist daclizumab, lower initial doses of tacrolimus, which lead to levels of reflection between 10 and 15 ng / ml and recently graft survival (Abu-Elmagd et al., Ann Surg 2001; 234: 404).</seg>
<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrit and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the unbound group of tacrolimus or a strengthening of metabolism brought about by treatment with corticosteroids should be responsible for the higher clearances observed after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby the excretion mainly occurs over the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">The systemic exposure of tacrolimus (AUC0-24) under Advanage was approximately 10% lower than under Prograf in the case of stable patients undergoing prograf (once daily) in relation to 1: 1 (mg: mg) in relation to the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1497">It is recommended to carry out frequent checks of tacrolimus level levels during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1498">21 For the treatment of adult patients with transplant rejection, which proved to be refractory contrary to other immunosuppressants, there are still no clinical data for the retardated Advantf formulation.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (a congenital blood clotting disorder caused by the lack of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether advate is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, causing blood clots such as bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but produced according to a method called recombinant DNA technology:</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which it empowers to the formation of the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar to another drug approved in the European Union called Recombinate, but is made differently so that the medicine does not contain proteins or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, including a study involving 53 children less than six years, the use of the medicine was investigated for the prevention of bleeding and for surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"" "in the main study, the efficacy of advate in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new bleeding sepals was rated" "" "excellent" "" "or" "" "good" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of advate (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advate must not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against the human coagulation factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Baxter AG for the transport of lawyers across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII-lack, the location and extent of the bleeding and the patient's clinical condition.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following haemorrhagic events factor VIII activity is not to fall below the indicated plasma levels (in% of the standard or in I.E. / dl) during the corresponding period of time.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) repeat for 3-4 days or longer until the pain and acute depression are removed.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Repeat the injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the risk is over for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment course, appropriate determination of the factor VIII plasma levels is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of the injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in their response to factor VIII, achieve different in vivo recovery and have different half-times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 Prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg of body weight should be given within 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII-plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, a test must be carried out in order to prove an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the Factor VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures must be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The rate of administration should be based on the patient's desire and a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well-known complication in treating patients with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII-directed IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma with modified Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to Factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is the greatest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure times and an amnestically known inhibitor development, after conversion from a recombinant Factor VIII product to another, the re-emergence of (low-tide) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of hemophilia A in women no experience exists about the use of Factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs, which occur in the largest number of patients, were inhibitors of factor VIII (5 patients), which showed a higher risk of the formation of inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very often (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of individual patients (234). the unexpected drop in the blood coagulation factor VIII-Spigel occurred postoperative (10 - 14 postoperative day) in a patient under continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Blood clotting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VIII- mirrors in the plasma and the Clearance rate showed sufficient values on 15 postoperative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical studies with ADVATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed heavy to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days) only one patient showed a low inhibitor (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach) after 26 exposure days.</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, in none of the 53 pediatric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed heavy to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%), a FVIII inhibitor was detected by prior exposure to factor VIII concentrates (≥ 50 days).</seg>
<seg id="1562">Previously untreated patients of a ongoing clinical trial comprised 5 of 25 (20%) patients treated with ADVATE inhibitors against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The patient's immune response to trace of contaminated proteins was analyzed by examining the antibodies against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">A patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend and a sustained peak of the antibody level versus anti-CHO cell protein, but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms that had an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Four patients were informed about the occurrence of urticaria, pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophiles granulocytes in multiple repeated product expositions within the study.</seg>
<seg id="1566">7 As with other intravenous products, ADVATE reported hypersensitivity reactions from the allergic type, including anaphylactic / anaphylactic reactions (frequency not known).</seg>
<seg id="1567">The activated factor VIII acts as a factor factor for the activated factor IX and accelerates the formation of activated factor X from factor X.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, the CHMP has still considered the benefit risk assessment as positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, based on the ADVATE security profile, which necessitates a filing of PSURs every 6 months, the CHMP has decided to apply for further renewal procedures in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited announced the approval of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) to withdraw its application for the treatment of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni-Cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Usually, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft tissues (tissues that link and support other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"" "the virus in Advexin is an" "" "Adenovirus" "", "which has been modified in such a way that it cannot produce copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans." ""</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have been injected directly into the tumors and thus enable cancer cells to re-form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53-protein produced from the p53 gene that is not defective in the human body normally contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In Li-Fraumeni-Cancer, where the p53-gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient in which Li-Fraumeni-cancer occurred in the area of the abdominal area, in the bones and in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had examined the answers of the company on the questions asked, there were still some questions unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the examination of the documents submitted initially, the CHMP creates a list of questions that will be sent to the company on day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP opinion it was not sufficiently proven that the injection of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni tumors brings advantages for patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns about the treatment of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1652">Furthermore, the company had not adequately proved that Advexin can be produced in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not inform the CHMP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or "Compassionate-Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "changed drug release" "" "means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective components is immediately released and the other slowly released over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerobaze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nasal passages caused by allergies to pollen) in patients with nasal mucous swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and young people aged 12 and older, the recommended dose of aerobaze is twice a day a pill that should be taken with or without food with a glass of water.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are cluttered.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medication can be reduced to constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main activity levels were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hay fever symptoms other than constipation of the nose the patients who took aerobaze reported a decrease in the symptoms by 46.0% compared to 35.9% in patients receiving pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients under aerobaze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who were left alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerobaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart hunting), dry mouth, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, somnolence (somnolence), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerobaze may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, pseudoephedrine, or any of the other components against adrenergic agents or lauatadin (another medicine for the treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerobaze may also not be applied to patients suffering from a bottleneck glaucoma (hypertension), heart or vascular disease (hypertension), hyperthyroidismay (hyperthyroidism), hyperthyroidism (hyperthyrosis), or a risk of haemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the transport of aerobaze throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but it can be swallowed whole (i.e. without breaking it, breaking it or chewing it).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Because of the lack of data for safety and efficacy (see Section 5.1), Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms subsided.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days, since the activity of pseudoephedrine can decrease over time with long-term application.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After a decline in the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, the treatment can be continued with desloratadin as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since aerobaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within 2 weeks after finishing this therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity associated with combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictions such as bromocriptin, pergolid, lyurid, cabergoline, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, nhazolin etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient group and the data is insufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerobaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is insufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that the treatment must be stopped in case of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or a strengthening of headaches).</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients with hypertonia • Patients with hypertonia • Patients with hypertonia • Patients with a myocardial infarction in the anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder obstruction or bronchospasm in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerobaze must be suspended at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests, since antihistamines otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or to reduce them to their degree.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical trials with desloratadin, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally given, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor test showed no significant difference between the patients treated with desloratadin and placebo, regardless of whether it was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin does not inhibit CYP3A4 in vivo, and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the application of aerobaze during pregnancy is not guaranteed, but experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, did not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">As reproductive studies of animals cannot always be transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aerobaze in pregnancy should not be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1685">Patients should, however, be informed that in very rare cases it may result in a lightheadedness that may lead to impairment of traffic or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremolors, convulsions) with potential lethal processes.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, aggravated mitigation, muscle weakness, and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, breathing insufficiency, heart rhythm disorders, tachycardia, palpitations, drowsiness, pre-cordiale pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, visual disturbances and hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS-stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropin-typical symptoms (dry-dry, pupil-starre and - dilatation, redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include inhibiting the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P-Seltin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance, including the amplification of subjective slackiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials there was no increased frequency of sleepiness compared to placebo at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestations of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients were involved in the age of 12 to 78 with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving aerobaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies histamine-antagonistic efficacy of aerobaze tablets was significantly higher on the basis of the total score for the symptoms (except for nasal mucous swelling), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine on the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of aerobaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucosa swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of aerobaze tablets did not show any significant differences regarding sex, age or ethnicity.</seg>
<seg id="1697">In the course of a single dose study for pharmacokinetics of aerobaze, desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes of the administration of the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerobaze in healthy subjects over 14 days, the flow equilibrium of desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">As part of a pharmacokinetical multi-dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects of the liver were poorly metabolised.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the sole administration of pseudoephedrine was bioequivalent to the exposure after injection of an aerobaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on safety macropology, toxicity in repeated application, toxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with desloratadin does not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in the oral administration of rats at a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and the Pharmacovigilance System described in Module 1.8.1 of the authorisation application is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to the alleviation of the allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's own substance, to develop its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerobaze tablets alleviate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever) such as sneezing, running or itching nose and tearing or itchy eyes while constipation of the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Inform your doctor if you suffer or diagnose the following symptoms or diseases under the use of aerobaze: • high blood pressure • heart chasing, palpitations • heart rhythm disorders • nausea and headache, or strengthening existing headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1710">If you take Aerinaze with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is a non-prescription medication.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Usability and operation of machines When used in the recommended dosage is not to be expected that aerobaze leads to lightheadedness or reduces attention.</seg>
<seg id="1712">If you have taken a larger amount of aerobaze than you should inform your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of aerobaze than you should.</seg>
<seg id="1713">If you forgot to take a dose of aerobaze, if you forgot to take a dose in time, take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the intended time.</seg>
<seg id="1714">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or notice any side effects that are not indicated in this information.</seg>

<seg id="1716">Heart palpitations or arrhythmia, increased physical activity, redness, flushes, confusion, blurred vision, dry eyes, nasal nose, nasal sinuses, throat infections, changes in the frequency of urination, itching, chills, depression, anxiety, and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="1717">Following the market launch of desloratadin very rarely has been reported about cases of severe allergic reactions (shortness of breath, whistling breathing, itching, hives, swelling) or skin rash.</seg>
<seg id="1718">Cases of palpitations, heart chase, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, drowsiness, sleep disorders, muscle pain, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, cases of liver inflammation and cases of conspicuous liver values has also been reported very rarely.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as a 5 mg tablet, 5 mg lyophilisate for taking (soluble trays), 2.5 mg / ml syrup and 0.5 mg / ml syrup and 0.5 mg / ml solution.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once daily, in the form of 2.5 ml syrup or syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven, the dose is 2.5 mg once daily, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was studied in a total of eight studies with approximately 4,800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies on seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies to patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">Effectiveness was measured by identifying changes in the symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadriceps, sleeping and performance on the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been presented to prove that the body devalues the syrup, the solution to the intake and the wax tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, if the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius resulted in an average decrease in the symptom severity (symptom counts) by 25 to 32% compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in the patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In both studies with Urticaria, the decrease in the scores of symptoms after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% was compared to 40 and 33% in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, lauatadin or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the transport of Aerius across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">A tablet once a day, with or without a meal, to alleviate symptoms in allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of desloratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out according to the previous disease progression and may end after the end of the symptoms and can be resumed when reappearing.</seg>
<seg id="1732">The persisting allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and over 4 weeks) may be recommended to patients during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with desloratadin tablets, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally given (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">Patients should, however, be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to light-headedness, which may lead to impairment of traffic or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3% more adverse events were reported in patients with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo were fatigue (1.2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study with 578 young patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side effect was headaches, this occurred in 5.9% of patients treated with desloratadin and at 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study with up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine-fold clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes inhibiting the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P-Seltin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">There was no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect as part of a clinical study with multiple doses given in the desloratadine at a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in which desloratadin was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine-fold of the clinical dose) over ten days, no extension of the Qtc interval was shown.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Desolatadin showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance, including the amplification of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tearing and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonally and perennial, allergic rhinitis may alternatively also be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and over 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronic idiopathic urticaria was investigated as representative of other forms of urticaria, since the underlying pathophysiology in different forms can be similar and chronic patients can be recited in a simple prospective.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the history of histamines is a causal factor in all urticarial diseases, it is expected that in other forms of urticaria, desloratadin also leads to an improvement in symptoms in other forms of urticaria; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and reduction of size and number of quadrupeds at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who did not react to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in itching by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desloratadin in comparison to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius significantly reduced sleep and wakefulness, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, in which the patient-demos were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rhinitis -population, a higher concentration of desloratadin was achieved in 4% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no clues for clinically relevant accumulation after a daily application of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) for 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not entirely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin inhibits in vivo not CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with desloratadin in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, calorie-rich breakfast) did not react to the availability of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies performed with Lloratadin and Loratadin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxicity profile of desloratadin and Loratadin in a comparable degree of the exposure of loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on safety macropology, toxicity in repeated dosing, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with desloratadin does not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1762">Coloured film (contains lactose monohydrate, hypromless, titanium dioxide, Macrogol 400, Indigo carmine (E 132)), colourless film (contains hypromless, Macrogol 400), carnauba wax, bleached wax.</seg>
<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of meals to alleviate symptoms in allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing physician should be aware that most of the cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years of age are caused by infection (see section 4.4) and that there are no data which support treatment of infectious Rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical anomalies, anamnesis, physical examinations and corresponding laboratory and skin tests should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Approximately 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabolise desloratadin and experience a higher substance load (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years, which is subject to a limited metabolization, is identical to that of children who are normally metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore, patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose absorption or a saccharase-issomaltase- insufficiency should not take this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Aerius tablets, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally given (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical pharmacological study, taking Aerius tablets and alcohol has not increased the performance-reducing effect of alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius syrup group as in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, the recommended dose reported 3% more adverse events in patients with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>

<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of desloratadin are similar in adults and children, the efficacy data of desloratadin in adults can be extrapolated to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">There was no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents, in which desloratadin was used for more than 14 days in a dose of up to 20 mg. a day.</seg>

<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and reduction of size and number of quadrupeds at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The dissemination of this limiting metabolizing phenotype was similar in adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations greater in black (18% adults, 16% children) than in Caucasian (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetical parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study with syrup formation on children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis, which are subject to limited metabolization.</seg>

<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the drug Agenerase, enhanced with Ritonavir, lowered the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effectively as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, amelase with Ritonavir increased the virus last after four weeks compared to patients receiving their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of aging (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (diarrhea), flatulence (flatulence), nausea, vomiting, rash and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase should not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amprenavir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Amelase should also not be used in patients who take St. John's wort (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or medicines that are broken down just like amelase and are harmful to health at high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, patients who take agenerase have the risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of the body fat), osteoarthritis (loss of bone tissue) or an immune reactivation syndroms (symptoms of infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of apgenerase in combination with other antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Apgenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic enhancer Ritonavir, but the committee noted that the benefits of amelase in combination with ritonavir in patients who have not taken any protease inhibitor have not been proven.</seg>

<seg id="1926">Amelase is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, proteasinhibitors (PI) -pre-treated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Apgenerase capsules are usually to be taken for pharmacokinetical boosters of amprenavir along with low doses of ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amprenavir should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and pretreatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amprenavir as a solution to intake is by 14% less than by amprenavir as capsule; therefore, agenerase capsules and solution for taking on one milligram per milligram basis are not interchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for amelase capsules is 600 mg of amprenavir twice daily along with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the enhancing addition of ritonavir (boosting), higher doses of agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for amelase capsules is 20 mg of amprenavir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of asgenerase in combination with low doses of ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Apgenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to the lack of data for harmlessness and efficacy (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetical data, the dose of amelase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorders should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be carried out with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver function disorders, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Apgenerase should not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent the substrates of the cytochrome P450-isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of amprenavir while taking amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that asgenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with agenerase does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Generic capsules are usually to be used together with low doses of ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing reduced liver function including chronic-active hepatitis show increased frequency of liver function disorders under antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous application of Agenerase and Ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucoccorticoids that are metabolised via CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the possible benefit of treatment prevails the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including disease Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of asgenerase with lovastatin and sivastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under monitoring the International Regised Ratio), methods are available for determining the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who take these medicines at the same time, amnase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amprenavir, the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be altered, however, the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored on opsy withdrawal symptoms, especially if even low doses of ritonavir are given.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the potential risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycol content of the agenerase solution to take into account, this form of formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Amelase should be reduced to 5 times if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors were reported on the presence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases in which medication was needed to be associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and with drug dependent factors, such as a prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hemophilic patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports of an increase of hemorrhage including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and haemarthrosis occur.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can be developed at the time of introduction of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), leading to severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although multifactorial etiology is assumed (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteoarthritis were reported especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with a low therapeutic latitude may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cytochrome P450-isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with a low therapeutic width asgenerase with ritonavir must not be combined with medicines whose active ingredients are mainly metabolised by CYP2D6 and associated with increased plasma levels with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of amprenavir which can lead to a virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In an attempt to compensate the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, adverse effects on the liver were often observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of amprenavir can be reduced by the simultaneous use of plant preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already takes St. John's wort, the amprenavirus mirrors and, if possible, check the viral load and remove the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose adjustment for one of the drugs is not required if Nelfinavir is given together with amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased, for Cmax being reduced by 30% when ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was given in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg of amprenavir were applied twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower if amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was given in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of amprenavir in the plasma, which were achieved in the combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is given twice daily in combination with 100 mg Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, however, a close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacokinetic study was carried out in combination with didanosin, but due to the fantasies of Didanosin it is recommended that the revenues of digestosine and asgenerase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dose adjustment is required in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effects of nevirapine on other protease inhibitors and limited data suggest that Nevirapin may reduce the serum concentration of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these medicines should be used at the same time, caution is advisable as Delavirdin could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma level.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these drugs are used together, caution is required; a thorough clinical and virological supervision should be performed, as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous injection of amprenavir and rifabutin led to an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) of rifabutin by 193% and associated side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin together with asgenerase, the dosage of rifabutin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose, although there are no clinical data available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with asgenerase in combination with erythromycin were not performed, however, the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fosamprenavir and 100 mg of ketoconazole once daily led to an increase in the Cmax of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) once daily without simultaneous application of Fosamprenavir with ritonavir observed.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, can, if applied together with atherase, may cause interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions associated with these drugs when used in combination with asgenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on data from other protease inhibitors it is advisable that antacids should not be taken at the same time as agenerase, since it may cause resorption alterations.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anticonvulsants known as phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amprenavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipin, Diltiazem, Felodipine, Israelipine, Nicardpin, Nifedipin, Nimodipine, Nisoldipin and Verapamil could be increased by amprenavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The simultaneous intake of atherase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and increase the associated side effects including hypotension, visual disturbances and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily together with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of subjects, the Fluticasonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly, whereas the endogenous cortisol dropped by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous gift of amelase with Ritonavir along with these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the possible benefit of a treatment prevails the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">In the case of HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, pronounced enhancements of the plasma levels are expected at the same time as the administration of asgenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">As plasma mirroring of these HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy, including a rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of this drug with amprenavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">More frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabilize the mirrors is recommended as the plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased with amprenavir simultaneous injection (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, agenerase should not be used together with orally taken midazolam (see section 4.3), while at the same time use of apgenerase with parenteral midazolam caution is required.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data on the simultaneous application of parenteral midazolam with other proteaseinase inhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of Midazolam in the 3 to 4 cases.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored on opsy withdrawal symptoms, especially if even low doses of ritonavir are given.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historic comparisons, there is currently no recommendation of how to adjust the amprenavir dose if amprenavir is given at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With simultaneous gift of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with asgenerase, increased control of INR (International Standard ised Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, so alternative methods of contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. Desipramine and nortryptilin) is recommended with simultaneous gift of asgenerase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this medicine may only be used after careful weighing of the potential benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">Amprenavir-related substances have been detected in the milk of lactic rats, but it is not known whether amprenavir is transferred to breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproductive study of pregnant rats, which was administered from the evaporation into the uterus until the end of the lactation amprenavir, showed a diminished increase in the 12 body weight during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of the offspring, including fertility and reproductive capacity, was not affected by the administration of amprenavir to the mother animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of agenera was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most adverse events associated with the treatment of asgenerase were mild to moderate, early on and rarely resulted in the treatment of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events have not been clarified whether they are associated with taking agenerase or any other drug used at the same time, or whether they are a result of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the adverse events listed below date from two clinical studies (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients with protease inhibitors did not receive 1200 mg of agenerase twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4) were evaluated by the investigators as related to the study medication and performed in more than 1% of the patients, as well as in the treatment of any laboratory changes (Grade 3 to 4).</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with a redistribution of the body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and retinal fatty tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorso-cervical fat accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Among 113 antiretroviral non pretreated persons treated with amprenavir in combination with lamivudine / Zidovudin over a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case (stitching) was observed (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the PROCS 3006 study, in 245 NRTIs, 7 cases (3%) occurred in 241 patients (11%) in 241 patients under indinavir, in combination with various NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Rashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or macular edema, with or without itching and occurred usually during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without having to cancel the treatment with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteoarthritis were reported especially in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In the case of HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can be developed at the time of the introduction of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pre-treated patients receiving 600 mg of asgenerase twice a day together with low dosed Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), the type and frequency of side effects (Grade 3 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4) were very common in patients who received atherase along with low dosed ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdosing, the patient is able to observe signs of an intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary to initiate necessary supporting measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active center of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the process of viral Gag- and gag-pol- polyprotein precursors with the result of a formation of inmature, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied in acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemmconcentration (IC50) of amprenavir is in the range between 0.012 and 0.08 µM in acute infected cells and is 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The correlation between the activity of amprenavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral non-treated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir-dosages - as with other ritonavir stained treatment schemas with protease inhibitors - the described mutations were rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral non-treated patients who received 700mg of Fosamprenavir with 100mg Ritonavir twice a day in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, with 14 isolates being genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">Genotypic analysis of the isolates of 13 of 14 children, in which a virological failure occurred within the 59 patients who were not previously treated with protease inhibitors, showed resistance patterns similar to those found in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, I54L / M / T / V, Q58E, D60E, I62A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg Fosamprenavir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice a day: n = 107) treatment with protease inhibitors occurred in patients with virological failure over 96 weeks, following the following protease inhibitor:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypic resistance testing based on genotypic resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of amprenavir / kritonavir or fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, I62V, V82A / C / F / M, I62V, V82A / C / F / V, I84V and L90M as well as a reduced probability of virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutations may be subject to additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Phenotypic resistance tests based on phenotypic resistance tests can be used in combination with genotypic data to estimate the activity of amprenavir / kritonavir or fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically-phenotypic cut-offs (divider points) for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four genetic patterns associated with reduced sensitivity to amprenavir creates a certain cross resistance to ritonavir, but the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on cross resistance between amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral non pretreated patients, in which a Fosamprenavir (containing a resistance to Lopinavir and saquinavir), indinavir / ritonavir (three of 24 insulates), indinavir / ritonavir (three of 24 insulates), saquinavir / ritonavir (four of 24 insulators), and Tidenavir / Ritonavir (four out of 24 insulators) appear.</seg>
<seg id="2033">Conversely, amprenavir keeps its activity against some other proteassionist-resistant isolates; maintaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early termination of a failure therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations within limits that can affect subsequent treatment adversely.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of efficacy of asgenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open trial, in which with PI pretreated adults after virological failure (viral load ≥ 1000 copies / ml) with a PI, predominantly fired with low-dose kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-three (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to asgenerase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI have been included in the part study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis showed the non-supremacy of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC PI group in terms of time-adjusted AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-lameness threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of unblocked arteries is based on two uncontrolled studies with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were pre-treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, apgenerase solution for taking and capsules in dosages of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dosed ritonavir at the same time; the majority of the patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with asgenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml for a median increase in CD4 cell numbers of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "19 Based on this data, the expected benefits of" "" "unbleached" "" "agenerase should be considered in the treatment optimisation of the children treated with PI." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral dosing, the mean duration (Tmax) is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased, for Cmax on the other hand lowered by 30% when ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) together with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) was given.</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of amprenavir with a meal results in a 25% decrease of the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosing (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the steady state (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by the intake of food, although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of absorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an unhindered penetration of amprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, whereby the amount of unbound amprenavir, which represents the active part, remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active constituent fluctuates during the dosing interval, depending on the total oxygen concentrations in the steady state over the area of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 or present a substrate of CYP3A4 must be given with care if they are given at the same time with agenerase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, results in a similar daily amprenavir exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is from the solution 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; therefore, agenerase solution and agenerase capsules are not interchangeable on a milligram basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal clearance of Ritonavir is also negligible, therefore the effect of renal dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of amprenavir and ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemes lead to amprenavir plasma levels comparable to those found in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of amprenavir twice a day without the simultaneous administration of ritonavir.</seg>

<seg id="2056">The underlying mechanism for the genesis of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been clarified and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, from the present exposure data on humans, both from clinical trials as well as from the therapeutic application, there was little evidence of the acceptance of clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in vitro and in-vitro genotoxicity tests, containing bacterial reverse mutation tests (Ames-Test), mouse lymphom test, microcore test of rats and chromosomal aberrations of human peripheral lymphocytes, amprenavir was neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in clinical practice by measuring AST, ALT and the alkaline phosphatase activity.</seg>
<seg id="2060">In clinical trials, no significant liver toxicity has been observed in patients, neither during the administration of asgenerase nor after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on toxicity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In systemic plasma exposure, which was significantly below (rabbit) or not significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposure under therapeutic dosages in humans, a number of minor changes including thymus ongation and minor skeletal changes were observed, which indicate delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If agenerase capsules are applied without the enhancing addition of ritonavir (boosting), higher doses of agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for amelase capsules is 20 mg of amprenavir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The simultaneous application should be performed with caution in patients with mild or mild liver function disorders, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under monitoring the International Regised Ratio), methods are available for determining the active substance concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2071">The Cmin values of amprenavir in the plasma, which were achieved in the combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is given twice daily in combination with 100 mg Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, however, a close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="2074">If these drugs are used together, caution is required; a thorough clinical and virological supervision should be performed, as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin together with asgenerase, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose 31, although there are no clinical data available.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipin, Diltiazem, Felodipine, Israelipine, Nicardpin, Nifedipin, Nimodipine, Nisoldipin and Verapamil might be increased by amprenavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily together with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of subjects, the Fluticasonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly, whereas the endogenous cortisol dropped by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">With simultaneous gift of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with asgenerase, increased control of INR (International Standard ised Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">The simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0,035 mg Ethinyl estradiol plus 1.0 mg of Norethinfusion) led to a decrease in the AUC and Cmin of amprenavir by 22% or respectively.</seg>

<seg id="2084">The antiviral activity of amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied in acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2085">The 50% Hemmconcentration (IC50) of amprenavir is in the range between 0.012 and 0.08 µM with acute infected cells and is 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells (1 µM = 0.50 µg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2086">Conversely, amprenavir keeps its activity against some other proteassionist-resistant isolates; maintaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2087">Based on this data, the expected benefit of "unbleached" agenerase should be considered in the treatment optimisation of the children treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2088">While the absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active constituent fluctuates during the dosing interval, depending on the total oxygen concentrations in the steady state over the area of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss..</seg>
<seg id="2089">Therefore, medicines that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 or present a substrate of CYP3A4 must be given with care if they are given at the same time with agenerase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>

<seg id="2208">Due to the immuno-stimulating characteristics, Imiquimod cream should be used with caution in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">Animal studies have no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, debonding or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although quantified serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) were not achieved either after unique or repeated topical application, no recommendation can be given to use during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most commonly reported and likely or possibly associated with the application of Imiquimod-cream in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the location of the treatment of the clinically (33.7% of patients treated with imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2212">The most commonly reported and likely or possibly associated with the application of the Imiquimod-cream in connection with side effects include discomfort on the application site with an incidence of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Basalioma patients treated with Imiquimod-cream from a placebo-controlled Phase III clinical study reported adverse events are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common, probably or possibly with the application of the Imiquimod-cream in connection with related side effects, were in these studies a reaction at the application site (22% of patients treated with imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2215">Adverse events reported from 252 in placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trials with actinic keratosis are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">These clinical signs, according to the protocol, show that in these placebo-controlled clinical trials with Imiquimod creme frequently occurred on local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), excreting / abscaling (23%) and edema (14%) (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">According to the study protocol, the evaluation of clinical signs shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with Imiquimod creme very often leads to severe erythema (31%), severe erosion (13%), and too heavy sweating and crest (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials investigating the use of Imiquimod for the treatment of actinic keratose, alopecia was observed with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment center or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The unique oral recording of 200 mg Imiquimod, which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically serious side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, consisted in hypotonia which normalized after oral or intravenous fluid indication.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetical examination the systemic concentration of the alpha interferons and other cytokines was detected after the topical application of imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal phase 3 efficacy studies it was possible to show that the efficacy in relation to a complete healing of the clinchers with an Imiquimod management over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment is clearly superior.</seg>
<seg id="2223">At 60% of all patients treated with Imiquimod patients were treated completely; this was the case with 20% of the patients who had been treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">Complete healing was achieved at 23% of 157 male patients treated with imiquimod, compared to 5% of 161 male patients treated with placebo (95% CI:</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of Imiquimod over 6 weeks per week was investigated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary superficial basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data presented in an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years showed that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all treated patients were clinically cured and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of Imiquimod on three times weekly application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four week, treatment-free period, was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non hypertrophic non-hypertrophic lesions within a contiguous 25 cm2 area of treatment on the unhairy scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The one-year data from two combined observation studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical healing after one or two periods of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications external clinically, actinic keratose and superficially BCCs do not usually occur in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Cream was studied in four randomised double-blind placebo-controlled studies of children aged 2 to 15 with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies in the dosages investigated there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or more).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic intake of 5% Imiquimod cream by the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratosis was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest concentrations of pharmaceuticals in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml when used in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable pouch), on scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated half-life time was about 10 times higher than the 2h half-life time after the subcutaneous use in an earlier study; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on systemic exposure showed that the absorption of Imiquimod after topical application on MC-infected skin of patients aged 6 - 12 years was low and comparable to that found in healthy adults and adults with actinic keratose or superficially basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study of dermal toxicity in rat doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; a study carried out four months for the dermal application yielded no similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice at three days per week did not induce tumours on the application.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutable, there is a risk for man due to systemic exposure to be regarded as very low.</seg>
<seg id="2241">Tumors occurred in the group of mice treated with the substance-free cream, earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (the symptoms that are not associated with brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not broken down and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, aggravating movements, decreased lung volume, heart and eye disease.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should be carried out in a hospital or clinic with revitalization devices, and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to the administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study mainly investigates the safety of the drug, but it was also measured its effectiveness (by examining its effect regarding the reduction of GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under the age of five, Aldurazyme reduced the amount of GAG in the urine by about 60%, and half of the children treated showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat feeling, fever, and reactions to the infusion.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under the age of five are elevated blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement size of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review all the new information that may be known and updated whenever necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will observe patients who receive Aldurazyme regarding the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission issued approval to the company Genzyme Europe B.V. for the transport of Aldurazyme across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammal cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be performed by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years was not determined, and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyma in patients with kidney or liver insufficiency was not determined, and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme may develop infusion-related reactions defined as any side effect associated with infusion or until the end of the infusion (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be performed in an appropriate clinical environment in which revitalization facilities are immediately available for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, it is expected that almost all patients form IgG antibodies against Laronidase, usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when using aldurazyms (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience regarding resumption of treatment after a longer break, due to the theoretically elevated risk of hypersensitivity reactions following an interruption of treatment must be cautiously preferred.</seg>
<seg id="2296">Treat 60 minutes before the start of infusion with medications (antihistamines and / or antipyretica) in order to minimize the potential incidence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In the event of a light or moderate infusion reaction, the treatment should be considered with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or reduction of the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the event of a single serious infusion-related reaction the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) and a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or procaine because there is a potential risk of interference with the intracellular intake of Laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal-experimental studies do not cause direct or indirect harmful effects on the pregnancy that include embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data is available on newborns exposed to Laronidase via breast milk, it is recommended not to breastfeed during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as infusion-related reactions that were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (duration of treatment up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were observed during the phase III study and their extension with a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older, are listed in the following table according to the following frequently (≥ 1 / 10); frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in prehistory, severe reactions also occurred, including bronchospasm, breathing stillness and obverse edema (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted drug effects related to Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study involving 20 patients under the age of 5, with a predominantly severe expiration form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients, a seroconic version occurred within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment, with a more severe form of seroconic in patients under the age of 5 (average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients with age of 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the Phase 3 study (or early withdrawal from the study), there were no antibodies that could be detected in 13 / 45 patients (RIP) assay, including 3 patients who had never come to Seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with low to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the GAG level in the urine, while a variable reduction of GAG in urine was observed in patients with high antibody tides.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralizing inhibiting effect on the enzymatic laronidase activity in vitro, which did not appear to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not seem to be associated with adverse drug reactions in connection with the incidence of adverse drug reactions, although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for enzyme replacement therapy lies in one of the hydrolysis of the accumulating medium and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient recovery of enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, the most likely about mannose-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were studied in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study in 45 patients aged 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited to study the entire disease spectrum, the majority of patients were of the mean phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for effectiveness were the percentage changes in the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6 minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open-label extension study where they received another 3.5 years (182 weeks) each week 100 E / kg Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Aldurazyme showed an improvement in lung function and the ability to walk in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / aldurazyme group, as highlighted in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FEV is not clinically significant over this period and the absolute lung volumes increased proportionally to the body size of children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a Hepatomegaly before treatment 22 (85%) until the end of the study had a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a clear drop in the GAG mirror was detected in the urine (µg / mg of creatinine), which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In terms of heterogeneous disease manifestation between patients who have been considered clinically significant changes across five efficacy variables (expected percentage of normal FEV, distance in the 6-minute walk, range of motion of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), there was generally an improvement in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were studied in 20 patients who were 5 years old at the time of their inclusion (16 patients with severe form and 4 with mean follow-up).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients, the dosage increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased Gagar Mirrors in the urine in week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size increase (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) were determined according to the Z-Score for this age group. the younger patients with the severe form of circulation (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed a normal mental development speed whereas in the older patients with severe form of circulation only limited or no progress in cognitive development were to be determined.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of various Aldurazymetry dosing schemes were carried out on the GAG mirror in the urine, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the characteristics of the medicine will be updated.</seg>

<seg id="2357">If Alimta is given together with cisplatin, before or after the gift of cisplatin, an additional "antithesis" (medicines for vomiting) and fluids (to prevent liquid deficiency) should be given before or after the addition of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood type changes or certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed, discontinued or the dose should be decreased.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of Pemetremixed slows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from splitting.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of Pemetremixed into its active form goes more easily into cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the medicine and a longer active time in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of malignant pleuramesothelioma, Alimta was studied in a major study on 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared to the effects of docetaxel (another medicine against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (another cancer medicine), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin lived an average of 12.1 months compared with 9.3 months for the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time with Alimta was 8.3 months compared to 7.9 months in docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients in which cancer did not attack the squamous epithelial cells had longer survival compared to the comparative medication during the administration of Alimta.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. to transport Alimta in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each water bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.9% sodium chloride injection (9 mg / ml), which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary dose is taken from the water bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is shown in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small terminal bronchial carcinoma (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of second-line treatment of patients with locales advanced or metastatic non-small cell carcinoma except for predominating plate-epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² of body surface (KOF) is administered intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin amounts to 75 mg / m ² KOF as infusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the Pemetrexed- infusion on the first day of every 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered as intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">To reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid should be given the day before and on the day of the pemetrexed gift and on the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of Pemetrexed, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must continue throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients must also receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) a week before the first Pemetremixed dose and after each third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving pemetremixed, a complete blood picture should be produced before each gift, including a differentiation of leukocytes and a thrombocyte count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine-transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose examination must take place taking into account the Nadir of the blood image or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of previous therapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After the recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are applicable for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients develop non-hematological toxicity ≥ Grade 3 (except neurotoxicity), treatment with ALIMTA must be interrupted until the patient has the value prior to treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be aborted if in patients after 2 dose reduction- a hematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity level 3 or 4 occurs or so- at the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or above, an increased side effect risk exists in patients at the age of 65 or above.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 due to insufficient data for harmlessness and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a Kreatinin-Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min, which go beyond the dose adaptations recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a Creatinin-Clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5-fold of the upper Bilirubin- Border value and / or transaminase values of &gt; the 3,0-fold of the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) were not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored and Pemetremixed must not be given to patients before their absolute number of neutrophils again has a value of ≥ 1,500 cells / mm ³ and the platelet number again has a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of the absolute neutrophus number, thrombocyte number and maximum non-haematological toxicity observed in previous treatment cycles (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 haematological and nontoxic toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neutropenia was observed when pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetremixed need to be instructed to apply folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic-lactic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (Creatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid simultaneous use of non-steroidal antiphlogistica (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsalicycleic acid (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days before the treatment with Pemetremixed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients for treatment with Pemetremixed need to avoid taking NSAIDs for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with Pemetremixed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in which these events occurred had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of renal events including dehydration, pre-existing hypertension or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with clinically significant fluid accumulation in the transcellular space, drainage of the effusion before pemetremixed treatment is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 major cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were reported in clinical trials involving Pemetremixed occasionally when this active ingredient was usually given in combination with another cytotoxic agent.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous use of attenuated vaccines (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to the reproductive capacity of Pemetremixed, men should be advised before the treatment tin to obtain advice on sperm conservation.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of nonsteroidal antiphlogistica (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid (≥ 1.3 g daily) can result in reduced Pemetremixed precipitation with the consequence of an increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore caution is advised if high doses of NSAIDs or asce- tylsalicylic acid in high doses are used in patients with normal kidney function (Creatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy, in the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with Pemetremixed are avoided (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since no data on the interaction potential with NSAIDs is available with long half-life like Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application with Pemetrexed must be prevented for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with Pemetre- xed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of INR (International Standard Ratio) when the decision was made to treat patients with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of Pemetremixed in pregnant women, but as with antimetabolites, serious birth defects are expected in an application during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetremixed must not be used during pregnancy except when it is absolutely necessary and after careful weighing of the benefits for the mother and the risk of the fetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to reproductive capacity is made by Pemetremixed, men should be advised before the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice regarding sperm handling.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether pemetrexed passes into the breast milk and unwanted effects on the breastfed baby cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the frequency and severity of unwanted effects reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma and the randomized Cisplatin and Pemetrexed - as well as 163 patients with mesothelioma who were randomized to receive cisplatin as monotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetremixed) is a antineoplastic antifungal that exerts its effect by interrupting important folate-dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that Pemetrexed works with multiple targets by blocking the thyme dylate synthase (TS), Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and Glycinamidribonucleotidfor- myltransferase (GARFT), which are the folate-dependent key enzymes of de novo biosynthesis of thymid- and purinnucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicenter, randomised, simple-blind Phase 3 study of ALIMTA plus Cisplatin for Cisplatin for chemotherapy patients with malignant pleuramesothelioma showed that with ALIMTA and Cisplatin patients had a clinically meaningful benefit of a median 2.8-months longer survival compared to those patients who were only curled with cisplatin.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Patients who take Alli and do not receive weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2505">If these enzymes are inhibited, they cannot metabolise some fats in the food, causing about a quarter of the fats contained with the food undigested the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In a third study Alli was compared with 391 overweight patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In both studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who took Alli 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg, compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">The study with Alli in patients with BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 could not be observed for patients with relevant weight loss.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of Alli (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are oily stains at anus, flatus (winds) with bowel labours, bowel movement, greasy / oily chair, outlet oily secretion (rotting), flatulence (winch) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It must not be used in patients treated with Ciclosporin (to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients) or with medicines such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="2511">It may also not be used in patients suffering from a long-term malabsorption syndrome (which does not absorb enough nutrients from the digestive tract) or to cholestase (liver disease), and in pregnant or nursing mothers.</seg>
<seg id="2512">In July 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited an approval for the transport of orlistat GSK throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight (body mass index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypocaloric, low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli should not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because insufficient data on efficacy and safety are not available.</seg>
<seg id="2515">However, as orlistat is only moderately resorbed, the dosage is not necessary in the elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">• Premature treatment with Ciclosporin (see section 4.5) • Chronic malabsorption (see section 4.6) • Premature (see section 4.6) • Premature treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see Sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) can increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich snack or low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a therapy because the dose of antidiabetic has to be adapted.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients taking alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol levels should ask their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage of these medicines has to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional pregnancy-contraceptive measures in order to prevent possible failure of oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">Both in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous application of orlistat and Ciclosporin, a reduction of Ciclosporin plasma levels was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat the Quick-Values (international standard-ratio, INR) could be influenced (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">Most patients who were treated with orlistat in clinical trials remained the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K as well as the beta carotene in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take a complementary multivitamin supplement before bedtime to ensure sufficient vitamin intake (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the dose of a single dose Amiodarone, a marginal decline in the Amiodarone plasma concentration was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal-experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are associated with the pharmacological action of the drug, as the absorption of captured fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequency is defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 100) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10.000), not known (frequency based on the available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The incidence of reported adverse events reported after the launch of orlistat is unknown, since these events have voluntarily been reported by a population of a certain size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† Es is plausible that treatment with alli may lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and obese subjects without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">Most of the cases of orlistat overdose reported after the market launch have either reported no side effects or similar side effects as reported at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on studies on humans and animals, a rapid recovery of possible systemic effects can be assumed, resulting from the lipase inhibitory properties of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect is used in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine by covalent bonding to the active Serin remnant of the gastrian and pankreatical lipases.</seg>
<seg id="2536">From clinical trials, 60 mg of orlistat was taken three times a day, which blocks the absorption of about 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled adults with BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60mg orlistat which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypokalorical, low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of randomisation), was assessed as follows: as a change in body weight in the course of study (table 1) and as a percentage of those study participants who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first six months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The mean change in the total cholesterol was 60 mg / 2.4% with orlistat (baseline 5,20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (baseline 5,26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in LDL cholesterol was 60 mg -3.5% (baseline 3.30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (baseline 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At waist circumference the mean change was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting value 103,7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (starting value 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after oral dosing of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, not metabolized orlistat could be detected sporadically and in extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study with obese patients the minimal systemic resorption was given, two main metabolites could be identified, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed Lactonring) and M3 (M1 after separation of the N-Formyl leucine group), which represented approximately 42% of the total plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2546">Based on conventional studies on safety macology, toxicity in repeated dosing, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot identify any particular danger to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemotherapies, which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting (like cisplatin), as well as in chemotherapies, which are moderate causes for nausea and vomiting (like cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The efficacy of alanxi can be increased by adding a corticosteroids (a medicine that can be used as an anti-emetics).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application for patients under 18 years of age is not recommended, as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active agent prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">In three main studies, Aloxi was studied in 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy, which are strong or moderate causes for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In the case of chemotherapy, the severe trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting (132 of 223), 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In the case of chemotherapies, the moderate release for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission issued approval to the company of Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd., an approval for the marketing application of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Alanxi is indicated: for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in highly emetogenic chemotherapy due to a cancer and for prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of alopxi for the prevention of nausea and vomiting, which is induced by a strong emetogenic chemotherapy, can be enhanced by adding a corticosteroid given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">As Palonosetron can extend the colon massage, patients with anamnestial obstipation or signs of subacute ileus after injection should be closely monitored.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is required with simultaneous gift of Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients with the QT interval extended or which tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, Aloxi is not intended to be used to prevent nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron did not inhibit tumor activity of the five chemotherapy drugs investigated (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabin, doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a Steady State- Concentration of oral Metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, CYP2D6 inductors (dexamethasone and rifampicin) as well as CYP2D6 inhibitors (ammiodarone, doxorubicin, fluoxetine, ranitidine, kritonavir, sertraline, and terbinafine) have no significant effect on the legacies of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences for the use of palonosetron in human pregnancies do not occur, so Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the treating physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common side effects were observed at a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients), which at least might have been related to Aloxi, headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the location (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing testimonials.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dose similar frequencies of undesired occurrences were observed as in the other dosage groups; there were no dose-effect relationships observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies have been carried out due to the large distribution volume, however, a dialysis is probably not an effective therapy for an allied overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies a total of 1,132 patients receiving moderate emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cisplatin, carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 of docxorubicin and 250 mg. of Dolasetron (half-life of 7.3 hours) were given that was given intravenously at day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomized double-blind study, a total of 667 patients who received a highly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2Cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin and 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of ondansetron which were given intravenously on day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study with highly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials of indication chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters, including the Qtc interval with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After clinical investigations, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation and prolong the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The objective of the study carried out at 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of the ECG effects of i.v. given Palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After IV dosing follows an initial decrease of plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminally half-life of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dosed proportionally in the total dose range from 0,3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">Following IV dose of palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase in the palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetical simulations show that the overall position measured at once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg palonosetron on 3 consecutive days was comparable with that measured after a one-time IV administration of 0.75 mg; however, the Cmax was higher after the one-time injection of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys, and about 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which in comparison to Palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro studies on metabolization we have shown that CYP2D6 and, in a lesser extent, are involved in the isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 on the metabolism of palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as an immutable ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">Following a one-time intravenous bolus injection, the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearance of 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although in patients with severe liver dysfunction the terminale elimination cycle time and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron are increased, however, a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical trials effects were observed only after exposures, which are considered adequately above the maximum human therapeutic exposure, indicating a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 Out of preclinical studies revealed indications that Palonosetron can only block ions in very high concentrations that are involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation and extend the duration of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose corresponded to about 30 times the therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given daily over two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal glands) and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and since Aloxi is determined by humans for one-time use, the relevance of these results is regarded as low for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a negative report in which the approval of approval for the use of the medicine prescribed for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means that Alpheon should resemble a biological drug called Roferon-A with the same medicinal ingredient that is already approved in the EU (also called" "" "referenced Medicinal Products" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by viral infections).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination the liver tissue damages damage, plus the values of the liver enzyme Alanine Amino ferase (ALT) in the blood abnormalize.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which stimulates these to the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (substance structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients, the efficacy of alpha eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study showed how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment were treated (i.e. no signs of the virus reported in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed will not suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Alpheleon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheeon, the disease was more resistant to more patients than with the reference drug. moreover, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the study used in the study was not sufficiently validated to investigate the extent to which the drug generates an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug).</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat impetigo (a skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected dormans, abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections which have been proven or probably caused by methiciline-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not work against these kinds of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied to patients from the age of nine months, but in patients less than 18 years the skin surface should not exceed 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment after two to three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell, in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibits the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of the efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients under placebo said treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin patients, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together with skin patients, approximately 90% of both groups responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo is not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (iron-filled cavities in body tissue) or infections that have been proven or probably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation on the job.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of altargo were predominated in the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections compared to the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small infirations, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. Ltd., an approval for the marketing of Altargo across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of sensitization or serious local irritation due to the application of Retapamine ointment, the treatment is canceled, the ointment is carefully wiped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection is started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retinamnion should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as a pathogen or suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials of secondary infections, the efficacy of retinosinulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs after a 2 to 3 day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous application of reapamines and other topical remedies on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans following topical application on skated skin or infected surface wounds, clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not to be expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous oral dosing of 2 times a day 200 mg of ketoconazole, the mean Retapaminoin AUC (0-24) and Cmax after topical application of 1% retapamine ointment were increased by 81% after topical application of healthy adult men.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dose adjustments are not considered necessary if topical Retapamoulin is used during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity after oral intake and are inadequate in relation to a statement affecting the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapaminoointment should only be used during pregnancy if topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retinosuline is preferable to the administration of systemic antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether breastfeeding continues / finishes or the therapy with Altargo continues / terminated, the benefits of breastfeeding should be considered for the baby and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for women.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which have applied altargo, the most common reported side effect irritation at the administration point, which concerned approximately 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Reapaminosis is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckeranus (formerly pleurotus passeckeranus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The active mechanism of Retapamiulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a certain binding site of the 50s sub-unit of the bacterial ribosom, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding site is involved in the ribosomal protein L3 and is located in the region of the ribosomal P binding site and the peptidyltransferase centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding on this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits the peptide transfer, blocking partial P-binding interactions and prevents the normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If due to the local prevalence of resistance the application of Retapamulin appears questionable in at least some infection forms, counselling should be sought by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of retinosinulin compared to S.aureus, irrespective of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of failure to respond to treatment with S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamine ointment was applied daily under occlusion to intact and peeled skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% reapamoulin ointment twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Samples took place on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before the medication and the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic intake in humans after topical application of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 of peeled skin (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the RetapaminoIC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retinapamoglobin in human liver microsoms was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, with lower participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out more than 14 days, there were indications of adaptive liver and thyroid disease.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In vitro examination on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in the rat microcore test for in-vivo investigation of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, whereby a up to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2 of peeled skin):</seg>

<seg id="2729">"" "" "" "Ambirix contains the same ingredients as the vaccines approved since 1996 and the vaccination approved since 1997." ""</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a three-dose vaccination plan.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of the efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective anti-antibody concentration a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study involving 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12 month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix initiated between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children one month after the last injection for the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix was similar to six and a 12 month intervals between injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection place, redness, fatigue, and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components, or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals to the company of GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for immunization with Ambirix consists of two doses of vaccine, whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a booster shot is required for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B, it can be inoculated with the appropriate monovalent vaccines or a combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HV).</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured that immunocompetent individuals who have responded to a Hepatitis A- inoculation need a booster shot as protection, as they may also be protected by immunological memory in case of no longer verifiable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all vaccines, an anaphylactic reaction following the injection of the vaccine should always be available immediately after the injection of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a fast protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme is recommended using the combination vaccine containing 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In the case of hemodialysis patients and individuals with disorders of the immune system, no sufficient anti-HAVs and anti-HBs antibody levels are achieved, so that additional inoculation doses may be required in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since intradermal injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal implication in the gluteal muscles, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In case of thrombocytopenia or blood clots, Ambirix can only be injected subcutaneously since it can result in bleeding in these cases after intramuscular administration.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was given in the form of a separate injection together with a combined diphtheri-, tetanus, acellular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenza type b-vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with a combined measur- mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immunodeficiencies, it is assumed that no adequate immune response is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the incidence of pain, redness, swelling, maternity, gastroenteritis, headache and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier Thiomercial and preservative-containing vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccines were administered to a total of 1027 vaccinations ranging from 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years, the compatibility of Ambirix was compared to that of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and matedness on a basis of calculation per accdose Ambirix, but not on a basis for calculation per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the dose of Ambirix at 50,7% of subjects compared with 39.1% in subjects after the dose of a 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects who had given Ambiola reported pain, compared to 63.8% in subjects who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">The frequency of maternity was comparable to a proband (i.e. over the entire vaccination cycle at 39.6% of subjects receiving Ambiola compared to 36.2% in subjects receiving the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The incidence of severe pain and maternity was low and comparable to that observed after the combination vaccine with the 3-dose vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1- to 11-year-old vaccinations, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirixgruppe was comparable to that observed in administration of the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of dechlorinated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, a frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection site) per dose, not per proband, was reported after vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccinations, which reported severe side effects during the 2-dose vaccination scheme with Ambirix or during the 3-dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of deactivated hepatitis B surface antigen, was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to including 15 years, the seroconversion rates for anti-HAV were 99.1% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, for the month of 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The seroconversion rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose administered for the month of 6 (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunogenicity was worthless, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher in the month 2 and 6 after the addition of the 3-dose vaccine significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immunotherapies that were achieved in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11-year-olds one month after completion of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccines received either a 2-dose vaccination scheme with Ambirix or a 3-dose vaccination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalinactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">People who were between 12 and 15 years old at the time of primerisation could demonstrate the persistence of anti-HAVs and anti-HBs antibodies for at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response observed in this study was comparable to that found after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical trial at 12 to including 15-year-olds, it was shown that the persistence of anti-HAVs and anti-HBs antibodies can be compared 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme to that in the 0-12-month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix in the second year was given at the same time with the booster shot of a combined diphtheri-, tetanus, acellular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis and 8 Haemophilus influenza type b-vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with the first dose of a combined measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar serum and seroconversion rates similar to earlier formulation for the current formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is to be examined both before and after resuspening on any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2781">Protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those after hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection can not be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If you / your child already showed an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any component of this vaccine including neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">Allergic reaction may cause itchy skin eruptions, shortness of breath, or swelling of the face or tongue. • If an allergic reaction has occurred with you or your child, an earlier vaccine against hepatitis A or hepatitis B occurs. • If you / your child have a severe infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and prior to the usually scheduled dose of the second vaccination dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he / her child will recommend 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective components per accato dose (360 ELISA units of a recombinant hepatitis B virus and 10 micrograms of recombinant hepatitis B surface).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective components is usually administered one month after the first dose and should give your child a vaccination protection prior to ending the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes, Ambirix is injected among people who suffer from severe blood clots, under the skin and not in the muscle. • If you / your child is weak due to illness or treatment in your body's own defence, or if you / your child undergo a hemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix may be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction is to vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Say to your doctor if you / your child is taking other medicines (including those that you can get without prescribing) or if you / your child have been vaccinated / / or immunoglobulins (antibodies) have been given / or this is planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">It may, however, be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambirix, it should be inoculated at separate places and as different limbs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">On the basis of the data, which have been known since the issuance of the first approval for the placing on the market, the CHMP opinion that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix was placed in circulation only in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to the low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonaps can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyperammonia mic encephalopathy (brain damage as a result of high ammonia concentrations) in the prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonaps is - split by several single doses at meals - swallowed, mixed under the food or administered via a gastrointestinal tube (through the stomach-leading tube) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach of leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study because Ammonsoon could not be compared with a different treatment or placebo (a dummy drug, that is, without substance).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonium can also result in loss of appetite, abnormal acid content in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, palpitation, stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that ammontaps in patients with disorders of the urea cycle are effectively prevented from high ammonia values.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "Ammonsoon was approved under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "because due to the rarity of the disease, only limited information about this medicine was available at the time of approval." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients in which a complete enzyme shortage has already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifest form (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifests itself after the first month of life) there is then an indication for use if a hyperammonia encephalopathy is present in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granule form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually, taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient needed for growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate is 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13,0 g / m ² / day for children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornicotyl alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with argininosuccinatal synthetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with swallowing disorders as there is a risk of the formation of oesophagus ulcera if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each dose of AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency as well as in case of sodium retention and edema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolisation and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrat is carried out over the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results with regard to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous injection of phenylacetate to young rats at high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg), there was a slowing of neuronal proliferation and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is excreted in the mother's milk by humans, and for this reason, the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during breastfeeding (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, at least 56% of patients had at least one adverse event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events were assumed to have not been associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactate, severe hypokalemia, curry topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose occurred in a 5 month old infant with an inadmittedly single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phenylacetate which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity with intravenous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is an metabolite active compound that is conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine which is excreted through the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogenous atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for the elimination of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that sodium phenylbutyrate recorded for each gram is produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that diagnosis is made at an early stage and treatment is immediately initiated in order to improve survival and clinical results.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prediction of the early manifest form of the disease coincided with the onset of the first symptoms in newborns, and the disease even led to death in the treatment of peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogues within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hemodialysis, the use of alternative methods of nitrate precipitation (sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced food and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborns in postpartal (however, within the first life month) of diagnosed diseases to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first onset of hyperammonia encephalopathy the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it was time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygote form of the Ornithintranscarpathbamylase deficiency), which recovered from hyperammonia encephalopathy and after that were permanently treated with sodium phenylbutyrate and a protein-reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible even in the case of treatment and a further worsening of the neurological condition can occur in some patients.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate which is conjugated in liver and kidney enzymatic with glutamine, whereby phenylacetylglutamine is produced.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined after dosing of a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, haemoglobin metabolism and with liver cirrhosis of up to 20 g / day (not controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behavior of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients after intravenous sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in tablet form, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were detected 15 minutes after intake.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urea-fatigue or haemoglobin-opathies, phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) was not detectable in the plasma after night fasting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with liver cirrhosis, which were repeatedly treated with sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">The drug is secreted by the kidneys within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the Micronucleus tests, sodium phenylbutyrat did not have a toxic effect with toxic and non-toxic doses (examination 24 and 48 hours after oral dosing of an individual dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules is either taken orally (infants and children who cannot swallow tablets or patients with swallowing disorders) or via a gastrointestinal tube or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat is 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13,0 g / m ² / day for children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornicotyl alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">If rat-flutes were exposed to phenylacetate (active metabolite of phenylbutyrat) before birth, there were lesions in the pyramid cells of the cerebral cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactate, severe hypokalemia, curry topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogenous atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for the elimination of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">Based on studies on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, it is assumed that sodium phenylbutyrate is recorded for each gram between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Existing neurological deficits are unlikely to be reversible either, and a further worsening of the neurological condition can occur in some patients.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in granule form, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were detected 15 minutes after intake.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of the shelf life the patient can store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not more than 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this procedure the small measuring spoon is 0,95 g, the measuring spoon is 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medication by means of a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water prior to use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so they cannot excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate in the body after consuming proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If you perform laboratory tests, you must inform the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS because sodium phenylbutyrat can influence the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">If you take AMMONAPS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is a non-prescription medication.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During breastfeeding, you may not take AMMONAPS as the medicine could go over to breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases confusion, headache, taste disturbances, hindrances of hearing, disorientation, memory disorders and a worsening of existing neurological conditions have also been observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you notice any of these symptoms you immediately contact your doctor or with the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of initiating appropriate treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with "acute coronary syndrome" (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example with instable angina (a form of pain in the thorax with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) (an anomalous measurement value for electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If Angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients undergoing a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help in patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angiox in combination with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another medicine for preventing blood clots) was compared with the conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anti-coagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, the patient often used a stent (a short tube left in the artery to prevent a closure), and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots such as Abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, Angiox - with or without the administration of GPI - was as effective in preventing new events (deaths, heart attacks or reascularisation) after 30 days or a year as effectively as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients undergoing a PCI, angiox in terms of all indicators was as effective as heparin, except for severe bleeding in which it was much more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to biologicaline, other hirudine or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who had a bleeding recently, as well as in people with severe high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable replacement for Heparin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the Company The Medicines Company UK Ltd approval for the transport of Angiox in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina / non-ST-lift attack (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of emergency intervention or early intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended indose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous infusion of 0.1 mg / kg, followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is carried out in a further consequence, an additional bolus of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resumed for 4 to 12 hours after the PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure, a value of 0.5 mg / kg should be given, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dose of angiox in patients with a PCI is an initial intravenous infusion of 0.75 mg / kg of body weight and a subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of any angiox bolus application has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is reduced to less than 225 seconds, a second bolus of 0.3 mg / kg / bodyweight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted pharmaceutical should be carefully mixed prior to use and the bolus dose should be administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1,75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate renal function (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subject to PCI (whether treated with an ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is less than 225 seconds, a second bolus dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolus dose to be checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate renal damage, which were included in the phase III- PCI-study (REPLACE-2), which led to approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after the administration of the Bivalidin-Bolus without dosage adjustment with an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe renal damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in patients with dialysis, angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with Angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intravenous administration of fractionated heparin or 8 hours after completion of the subcutaneous administration of low-molecular scissor.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• well-known hypersensitivity to the active substance or other ingredients or against hirudine • active bleeding or increased bleeding risk due to a disturbance of the hemostaasesystems and / or irreversible germ disturbance. • severe uncontrolled hypertension and subacute bacterial endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and in patients with dialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially if bivalidin is given in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if the majority of hemorrhages on arterial occlusions occur in the case of PCI patients, patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may occur throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients receiving warfarin and treated with biologicaline, a monitoring of the INR value (International Regised Ratio) should be taken into consideration to ensure that the value after settling the treatment with bivalidin is again achieved prior to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytica or Thrombocyte aggregates) it can be assumed that these active agents increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivalidin with thrombocyte aggregations or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemostasis parameters are to be checked regularly.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The animal-experimental studies are inadequate in relation to the effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, debonding or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to Bivalidin alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivalidatdin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomised to either unfractionated Heparin or Enoxenaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">In both the BiValirudin Group and the comparison groups treated with Heparin, women and patients over the age of 65 were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe hemorrhages were defined according to ACUITY and Timi standards for severe bleeding like in the footnotes of Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and heavy bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and Bivalidin plus GPIIb / III- Inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular hemorrhage, hematoma with a diameter ≥ 5 cm at the point of puncture, reduction of hemoglobin levels ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding point, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed bleeding localizations, which occurred with more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" point positions, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information on side effects is based on data from a clinical study with a bivalidin in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalidin Group and in the comparison groups treated with Heparin, women and patients over the age of 65 were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects that are not listed above have been reported in practice after comprehensive application and are grouped according to system organ classes in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In the case of overdosing, the treatment with a bivalidin should be stopped immediately and the patient is closely meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalidin, a direct and specific Thrombininhibitor, which binds both the catalytic centre and the anionic binding region of Thrombin, irrespective of whether thromboin is in the liquid phase or at clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">Binding of biologicaline to thromboin, and thus its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin on the other hand slowly splits the binding of Bivalidin-ARG3-Pro4, which regenerates the function of the active centre of thromboin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, a platelet-induced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS) was induced.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children aged six and up with diabetes requiring treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thigh or the upper arm injected or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level (sugar) in the blood or to process the insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin-lulisin differs very marginally from the human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration than a short-acting humanising.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in people with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, where the body cannot work effectively, Apidra was studied in a study involving 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of the efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed after six months (from 7.60% to 7.46%).</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the lowering of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% with human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin lulisin or any of the other components, or in patients already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">Doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Sanofi-Aventis Germany GmbH a permit to transport Apidra to the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra can be applied as subcutaneous injection either in the abdominal area, thigh or delta muscle or subcutaneous by continuous infusion in the area of the abdominal cavity.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Because of the reduced gluconeogenesis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, the insulin requirement in patients with a reduction of liver function can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the active strength, the brand (manufacturer), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the method of production may result in a change in insulin requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An inadequate dosage or abortion of a treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. these states are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Changing one patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change of dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of the occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change when changing the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">Substances that increase blood sugar-lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramid, fibrate, fluoxetine, methamine oxidase, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulfonamide-antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, sympaolytics such as beta-blockers, Clonidin, Guanethidin and reserpine may be weakened or absent.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal-experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin is transferred to human breast milk, but in general insulin does not occur in breast milk, nor is it absorbed after oral use.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are the unwanted drug interactions known from clinical trials and grouped according to the decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very often: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rare: ≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10.000); not known (frequency based on the available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold weldiness, cool and pale skin, tiredness, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, lack of concentration, dizziness, excessive hun- ger, changes in vision, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy If the injection site is constantly changing within the injection area, a lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycaemia with unconsciousness can be treated by means of an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), given by an appropriately trained person, or by an intravenous injection of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After glucosal injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycaemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake (especially through skeletal muscles and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at subcutaneous GA- be of Insulinglulisin the effect occurs faster and the time of action is shorter than with hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes, insulin sensitivity in the therapeutically relevant dosage range from 0,075 to 0,15 E / kg showed a dose-proportional dose-bearing effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucosal effect, just like humanising.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin-lulisin has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the full glucosal effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it became apparent that in an application of Insulinglulisin 2 minutes before the meal a comparable Post Abdendiale glycaemic control is achieved, such as with a human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin sensitivity was taken 2 minutes before the meal, a better postdendiale control was achieved than with a human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin is turned 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycaemic control such as in human normal insulin, which is given 2 mids before the meal (see Figure 1), is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulinglulisin at gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the start of meal in comparison to human normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min.) before the start of the meal (Figure 1A) and compared to a human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin lulisin at gift 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the start of the meal in comparison to human nor- malinsulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
