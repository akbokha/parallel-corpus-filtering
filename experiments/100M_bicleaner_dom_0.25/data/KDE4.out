&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; translate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; module can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras Website . select the source and target language of the translation from the drop @-@ down list . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated into place of the entire &amp; URL .
machine translation is only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . in the best case , bab@@ el@@ fish produces a rough translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore , the translations should not make important decisions without checking the translation beforehand .
only web pages on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated on the Bab@@ el@@ fish page , where you can directly insert text to be translated .
the package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them more readily available .
more information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the Manual to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings extensions ... Open the Tools tab and select the modules you want .
this is a list with default settings from the box k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that there may be more modules on your system if you have installed additional software .
you should install the package k@@ de@@ base , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; it contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Tools crashes . then you can view the page that has caused &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crashes , if available .
the view filter module ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras address filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed page . as default , the display starts with the root no@@ des of the document , example : document@@ Elements , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a more view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory on local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different tool@@ - and text views to view the contents of your local fil@@ esystem .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of plot@@ ting ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies using a so @-@ called tree map . tree Maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
with &amp; FS@@ View ; mirrors the size the size of a file or folder , with the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can be easily recognized even if it is far below in the folder hierarchy . consequently , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; -@@ command you will be considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap rendering a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your file system . for simpler navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have meaningful color and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle that is switched to View Mode can either display depth for easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or figure of another file property , such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ elled with the different properties of the respective file or folder . for each property you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rect@@ angle is to be used . furthermore , you can set the relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rect@@ angle .
when performing algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is proportion@@ ate to the size of the entry . in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always maintained . it will be frames to indicate the ne@@ sting of entries , and this box will need space that will then lose the subordin@@ ate entries . note that less space is lost for the frame if the rect@@ angle is square .
the distribution of the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . here it is always advantageous for lab@@ eling and to avoid space loss by frame , that rec@@ tan@@ gles are formed that are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are rows , columns or recur@@ sive divisions .
you can set the minim@@ ally represented area for an entry via the menu entry View Att@@ ach on Area . instead , a space pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally it was &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get , which was developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
the picture gallery module can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras image gallery ... or with C@@ trl ; I .
when you visit the Picture Gallery module , a dialog opens , which allows you to specify the image of the gallery .
the title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the images per line has a sli@@ der and a rotation field to set the number of thumb@@ nails in each line in the gallery .
use the check box to indicate the file name of the image and see if the file names are displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
the check box file size of the image tells you if the file size is shown in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
with the image size check box , specify whether the size of the images is shown in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
in the dialog folder , specify where the gallery is saved and which sub@@ folders are to be included .
in the Save in HTML file , specify where to save the HTML page .
using the sub@@ folder check@@ box , you can adjust with a sli@@ der or a rotation field , up to which level the sub@@ folders are included .
copy the original images with the check box to see if the original images are to be copied to the gallery .
use the comment field to use a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
in the check box O@@ wn colour depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original pictures .
the module &amp; HTML ; Settings provides easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; Settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
the media playback for the navigation pane can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Windows navigation pane or with the short@@ cut F@@ 9 .
to play , click in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or navigation area ; and drag the music files you want to listen to in the media playback .
change browser detection adds a menu entry in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; in addition to which you can change browser and operating system recognition for individual domains . this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers .
the default browser recognition of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a web page that refuses to access this browser , change browser detection in one of the following options .
changes the password in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that deny access with browsers on the basis of Mozilla . for example , you need the M@@ SI@@ E browser detection to connect to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail .
pages that do not correspond to the W@@ 3@@ C standard or use your own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identi@@ fier of this out@@ dated browsers .
with this option , the displayed browser detection is used for all pages of the website you are currently viewing .
with the menu entry Add ... you can set the extent of the information on the browser used and the operating system in the individual .
with this &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; module review your &amp; CSS ; style sheets and &amp; HTML ; documents in accordance with the recommendations of W@@ 3@@ C and other standards .
check the module website in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; check the menu under Extras Website . the following checks can be performed :
with the &amp; HTML ; check out if your &amp; HTML ; document of the syntax of &amp; HTML ; matches any found bugs will be displayed . with this test you can make sure your pages are displayed correctly by all browsers .
allows you to review your &amp; CSS ; style sheets embedded in a &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; document . with valid &amp; CSS , your web pages have a uniform appearance regardless of the browser used .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface will be made available to you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ plug ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , any medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ cam ; work together .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; includes a fast image processing with basic image processing tools . you can use these to view , comment , review and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ plug ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion via li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC colour management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; via the camera or the lens , which can be searched .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; Programs is also digi@@ ti@@ zed ; an open source project . that means it is dependent on the support of end users . therefore , you should report problems and opportunities for improvement .
if you are using these links , your web browser will open a page in the error report system . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . all required information is entered here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ plug , then we would like to encourage you to answer questions from other users . however , in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
you can also visit the digi@@ plug ; homepage to learn news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ BO@@ s ; to learn .
the best way to get started is to register in the developer mailing list . instructions for registering in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ BO@@ s ; .
when you start &amp; digi@@ plug ; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your pictures and database . you can enter a local , remote or removable folder . simply enter the path name or click the Fol@@ der icon Fol@@ der icon to select a folder .
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer , where the data is stored . this path stays the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you would like to add . &amp; digi@@ plug ; will also be used as an al@@ ame library .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder that contains pictures , as base folders . &amp; digi@@ code ; views each sub@@ folder as an album . no image will be changed .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; thir@@ sts recur@@ sively the library path in its entire depth . you cannot exclude sub @-@ folders unless it is i@@ ste in hidden folders . this lets you insert ex@@ hal@@ bs &amp; digi@@ plug ; do this by inser@@ ting a dot in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as basic folder , you will notice that the albums in My al@@ ben@@ directory do not have any photos as symbols . you can change that by using any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up &amp; digi@@ cam ; set up your digital camera . after that you should learn how to use My Albums and My Key@@ words to manage your photos in the albums .
raw File Support : if you are using the raw mode of your camera , it can be digi@@ ti@@ zed ; support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help Roh@@ art Support menu .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface will be made available to you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ plug ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , any medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ cam ; work together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera then appears as a disk drive . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; uses the g@@ Photo@@ 2 program to communicate with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and trans@@ missions via the serial port are slow , this connection is now obsol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ plug ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that digi@@ plug thumb@@ nails can be read out reliably . if the Ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might not be able to see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things to digi@@ plug ; is how easy it is to expand its functionality through modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ BO@@ ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ gs and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in almost any way as a user can . their advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; digi@@ code ; by writing a small module to complete a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ code ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; or change them to full screen with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
pulling and dropping images works everywhere : you can put an image in another part of the al@@ um@@ tree , above the horizontal dividing line or into another application window . the only limitation is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords , data list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is only used for the fields currently displayed in the symbol view . in this way , filtering on the fil@@ en@@ ame only works if this is shown in the symbol view . which fields can be displayed in the dialog of the Al@@ pe settings .
the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ BO@@ s are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date on which the album was first created .
if you have set up a scanner you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select Album Im@@ por@@ ate pictures . you can also add a screen@@ shot to an album .
in order to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the then appearing menu you will have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album features , right click on the album and edit the album features in the context menu .
album collections : are a method of marking your albums so that you can group under a common name . the collection you have set will be used to sort your photos by selecting or sorting items from the collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do so in the settings for collections .
the album date : used when you sort your albums by date with View albums sort by date .
the Buttons El@@ der , A@@ verage , New Year : these set the date on that of the oldest , the newest picture or that of the average of the album . for this purpose it is first tried to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder .
if you first have an album in &amp; digi@@ plug ; open , the first picture in the album will be selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this should help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , you have to click the picture with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu &amp; quot ; As an album preview , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can always be included only in a collection and collections can &apos;t be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; supports input of keywords for single photos in the section My keyword list at the bottom of the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection always includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window will provide you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images in this album will be displayed in the picture window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the toolbar .
when you open an album the first time , you need to wait short while the preview images are generated . you can avoid this in which you use All preview images in the Tools menu .
information on each image is displayed below the corresponding preview . which information this is , you can edit the Edit menu ; set up the albums page and adjust the preview images to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the screen shot at the top of the introduction to the main window shows such a help window .
photos are all that is about &amp; digi@@ plug ; works . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . image editing displays your photos and allows you to reach a number of improvements to this . you can reach all the functions that have been edited with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can choose between viewing the images , a slide show or the editing of the images .
you can open the image processing with a photo by clicking either F@@ 4 Image Edit ... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing ... . in the Edit section , you will find a guide on how to edit your photos . with image editing , you can view and change your photos .
it may happen that &amp; digi@@ BO@@ s ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the File menu . to do so , and how to adjust it to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after processing other image editing programs , problems with the metadata included in the picture may occur . some programs do not store this data when you save the modified image . this information is lost from the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data such as orientation , aperture , etc .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select rotation . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , right click on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . keep in mind that you will retain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you delete a photo &amp; digi@@ plug ; delete it , it is moved into the garbage dump of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 Image Del@@ ete or Del@@ ete If you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
the View &amp; quot ; My Data License ; organize your photos by means of the data . &amp; digi@@ code ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last modification of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be displayed in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the date page so that you will only be shown the photos of the selected days .
photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found again by selecting this keyword or searching .
if a keyword is selected , all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed .
keywords can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword , so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking on &amp; quot ; My keyword ; or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword . if you add a new keyword after you cli@@ cked on an existing keyword , this keyword will be used for this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting dele@@ tion . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword is removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by pulling it to the desired position in the tree and put it there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting a keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword ; change .
to select another photo as an album icon , you have to click the picture with the right mouse button and select Set as Album preview in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
this can happen in two ways : once you select the photos you want to use with a keyword , you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword ; drag and drop them . alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the thumb@@ nails and select from the context menu keyword .
you can add a photo with any number of tags . the photo is displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way you can give a keyword for each person in a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made , etc .
once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will be displayed in the main window under the preview of the image .
you can remove a keyword in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and select Rem@@ ove from the keywords menu . the menu only shows the keywords assigned to the photo .
the time beam view displays a time @-@ dependent , adjustable hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . in order to select a time frame , you only have to click on the bottom rect@@ angle of the selection frame , which indicates the time unit . this will display all the corresponding images in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . this will then appear in the list below .
includes all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , dat@@ est@@ amps , and more .
ne@@ on er Search box is a small lamp that will be green when the search finds hits . if you click on this , the filtering will be deleted and all images will be displayed again . if the search has not found , then the lamp becomes red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this you will get a simple search box like the one described above . however , you can save this search here as a live search , which will always filter what you have entered as a search criterion .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search will be executed . the results will be displayed in the My Search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after searching , you only need to select the corresponding entry from the My Search list and select an option in its context menu .
if you choose to edit search , the search form will appear again with the search information you entered . if you select an advanced search , the dialog for the advanced search will appear to change your previous search . more information can be found in the Advanced Search Tool section .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Search in the context menu Search .
advanced Search provides you with an advanced search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields of digi@@ plug ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ database . all rules are displayed line @-@ wise , separated by operators . an option can be associated with others about logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ...
&amp; digi@@ plug ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows images to compare by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two picture signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop every picture to find a similar . by means of a si@@ gh@@ ing , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you push a picture from somewhere over the icon of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , it will open and you can drop it there .
sket@@ ch : free @-@ hand colour sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and &amp; edited ; find the matching pic@@ s . also here a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini program . you can zoom in or out using the mouse wheel . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this requires , of course , that your images contain ge@@ o @-@ data .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter , which is then added for a later use of the list below . it works like a live Geo@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; provides an illuminated table in a separate window that you can easily compare pictures . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L To add the lumin@@ aire from the context menu . the selection will be added to the lighting table and its window will be opened .
from the preview toolbar you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window . a small arrow indicates which copy is to be seen in which window area . if you select Pre@@ view from the toolbar and move the zoo or move operations on one of the images , you can compare the same area of the two images .
another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images . if you use pair @-@ style navig@@ ating from the toolbar , then the two first pictures are automatically loaded into the fields . use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to see it in the right pane . this makes it easy to work through a series of similar pictures .
of course , the normal delete actions work directly from the lumin@@ aire like e.g. F@@ 4 file editing ....
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the light table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in p@@ anning function that you can see on the crossed arrows . to rotate the visible area of the image , you have to click on them and the &amp; L@@ MB . in the preview mode , both images will show the same image area .
the zo@@ oming works just like in other views . just use the zoom knob under the images or C@@ trl ; scroll wheel to zoom into the image and out . this happens in both images if you are in the preview mode .
what is a digital inventory management - apart from the fashion word ? digital inventory management considers every part of the process following after the image has been made up to final output and permanent storage . each of the photos receives , scans or digitally records a form of digital inventory management . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to back up , find , protect , and use photos again . we consider downloading , ren@@ aming , removing , group@@ ing , archiving , optimizing , waiting and ex@@ porting image files .
&amp; quot ; digital inventory management adop@@ ts , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , conf@@ ec@@ tioned and exports assets that have a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data on data . metadata is based on your definition of data that provides information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
I dare say if you find more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you need to find no longer a certain photo without inventory management . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then do not use &amp; digi@@ plug ; . the approach to save the metadata in both a database and in the image files guarantees very fast search and secure archiving which you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate anything into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you must decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure that you have to switch to a larger drive at some point .
you might be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can quickly be found across your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; then export is a folder for images that you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have different requirements such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images to different subjects and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % of archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the batch processing easier . separate new ones from old files .
the separation of original and work files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know whether you are looking for an original or derived image .
we also recommend the metadata option to be saved in &amp; digi@@ plug ; this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ? to do so , digi@@ cam provides them with a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work starts , because you should assign keywords , labels and an evaluation to every photo . of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos while working .
now let &apos;s talk with keywords , keywords , as you frequently call other programs , or continue categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded stit@@ ch , then digi@@ ti@@ zed ; automatically build the tree for you or place the images in the right place . sorting the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dra@@ gging a sub@@ tree to another . the modified key words are edited by &amp; digi@@ BO@@ s ; updated as the sub @-@ trees are followed .
the graphic shows how different metadata is overl@@ apping . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you don &apos;t want to let anyone just see your photos , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . you are sure to be interested in how your photos arrive .
take a look at this panorama . from far away is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look closer , start seeing some details , people , the place .
and now I &apos;ll tell you this one of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! one starts to dream , have associations , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence .
for others who view your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the observer to help him understand what you understand .
it is fine if an image is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , as let@@ tering . you can even export it for a selection of images . if you export your pictures to web galleries , these labels will be exported to the cap@@ tion and / or the title of the web gallery system . so you don &apos;t have to tell the story a second time .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system ? wasn &apos;t it a boring planet before Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of spatial presentation now drives with speed of light .
the possibilities of using ge@@ olo@@ cation are countless and will become even deeper in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually rer@@ un your travels with images with geographic information . &amp; digi@@ cam ; can also export k@@ ml files that you can open with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and den@@ otes the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the works of others .
the following description tells you which information in the direction page of &amp; digi@@ BO@@ s ; as information should be deposited :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can be used . this field does not support comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators .
author &apos;s title ( syn@@ onym for publisher line ) : linked to the author . this field contains the work name of the photographer . examples for this can be titles like : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for vendors ) : use the provider field to identify who works the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer works for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here that you can see the picture .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not offer protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in the work with computers can delete or modify these , in the picture . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ cam ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .

of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section it &apos;s about problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes a loss of data .
of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archi@@ val @-@ quality which last longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVD , &amp; Dollar ; 2 the piece claiming a lifetime of 100 years .
CD / DVD discs can become un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk where you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write a lot more reliable .
75 % of the data is only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and check@@ sums . despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bo@@ ster that apparently works wonders in CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux , but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical Media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to win the format war against the HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disk can store 50 GB and thus almost h@@ exag@@ onal the capacity of a Dual @-@ layer DVD with 8,5 GB . all that was said about CDs and DVDs is of course also the Blu @-@ ray disk .
burn slowly with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ate format . afterwards , read the media with a description , date &amp; author and store it on a clean , dark dry and protected spot . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
your manufacturer &apos;s warran@@ ties include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard drives on this topic : dis@@ cor@@ t study
the most common error reason for S@@ MA@@ RT is the most common error reason , S@@ MA@@ RT is not able to detect these errors . some of the errors detected by S@@ MA@@ RT indicate the im@@ minent failure . these are especially reading errors and displacement meters . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you saved the files , but these losses can normally be recovered without great problems .
while most electric appliances don &apos;t make a lot of electric sho@@ cks , it looks different in devices with computer chips and high speed processors . these can cause severe damage . on your computer these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause lost key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware aging , destroyed motherboard and other defects . so protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy heat and ends up the rest . it is normally available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar . however , remember that not every connector also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection , you should ensure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard , which guarantees a certain minimum of protection .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are also protected . some manufacturers also supply voltage cont@@ actors that also have a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while over@@ voltage protection protects your system against minor fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds may lead to loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . therefore , it may be useful to invest in un@@ interrupted power supply .
in addition to protecting against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power ou@@ tage occurs . some models allow you to continue working until the current exp@@ ires . if you purchase a U@@ PS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with the cost of avoid@@ ance . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can cost you up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W U@@ PS you can pay for less than &amp; euro ; 40 .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Sim@@ ple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can mount it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software . Google Shared Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data .
you are in comparison to the hard drives at home however very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; Dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; Dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data about the comparatively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution for a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are fed to photos . the professional version provides you more at your disposal , in the case of Fli@@ ck@@ r .
from the viewpoint of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and with large companies included in the offer a backup and a distributed memory . thus , they are safe .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all transfers are prone to transmission errors . the Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs file system ensures at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing about it is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . all these disturbances remain und@@ et@@ ected until you have no protection in your computer . no one seems to have ever thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data route than the one in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . you will see thousands of mistakes per year already in 2010 .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with record defects on a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon also be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows .
Oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . it is still alpha @-@ status . it uses the same protection mechanisms used by the Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not yet part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss of the not@@ ebook and 46 % in the workplace systems . in not@@ ebooks , the share of theft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to lower damage , e.g. theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; has been seen for a long time .
open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process at a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not stored completely before the problem occ@@ ured , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss .
digital cameras &apos; sensors are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel cameras . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is rather worse . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DS@@ LR cameras have a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard disk today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t worry anyone else for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected every year from a data loss . so , back up your data to a plan and test this backup before you make any hazardous such as the re@@ installation of your operating system , the replacement of disks or the size change of hard drives .
suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , a flash will hit you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget plane crash : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house .
therefore Des@@ ast@@ er@@ gen prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above is a common reason for a data loss despite backup the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential lock : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snapshot at two time points : the complete backup and the last differential lock .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . it generates several snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup has been made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only copies the difference between files that have really been changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security over ss@@ h .
back up important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or any other optical medium .
this procedure allows you enough time to detect and restore losses . at the same time , you will get a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . any further di@@ lution should be done manually after you have made a complete review .

so that valuable pictures survive the next 40 year that is approximately the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature you have to look at all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate while time goes by . unfortunately , there is no other way than the current system backwards compatible . the less variations you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered on the basis of the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alisation is now available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , keep it and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , storage and backup technology , or change your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have set the scal@@ ability with you and have placed the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . with * ni@@ x systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and store it onto a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record was detected by the system , but do not hang it .
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of this if necessary
open Source Standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software that can read it , then you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more .
it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can store g@@ amma and chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved color assignment for hetero@@ geneous platforms . the disadvantage is that it requires relative many administrative information , but not as many as TI@@ FF and has a slow compression . this format we would like to recommend to you to save your pictures .
TI@@ FF is widely used as an image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss @-@ free compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . therefore , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a roy@@ alty @-@ free and open format format developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and required to use metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are now available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it some@@ time .
this is possibly one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block quot ; technology of the 90@@ s . it is a coding technology that allows users to em@@ bed their data into a file itself . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ ml quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers drag it in front of an original of your photo , mostly in raw format . X@@ MP is capable of storing the metadata separately from the image file , but it can cause problems when linking the metadata file and the image file , and as mentioned above , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put it all together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include working on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in D@@ C@@ MI communities and D@@ C@@ MI work@@ groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera edi@@ um , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save it to your raw archive . this function is not implemented yet .
for a subtle editing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; digi@@ plug ; edit , then you should add the metadata again , which may have been cut off by the other programs .
protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . only export them in web galleries , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print them , etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ plug ; to get . in section adding a photo to an album you can add a description on how to add photos you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; to use , connect it to the computer , turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on . another description for this can be found in the manual of your camera .
if you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a fer@@ ential indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are shown on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the Met@@ adata displays the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer notices , GPS , etc. of the image . this information is the same as the metadata side bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ plug ; or image processing .
the easiest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection of All . this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ plug ; . downloading the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all the photos , you can only select the desired by &amp; k@@ de standard selection methods ; once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and then download Sel@@ ected Sel@@ ected . the Sel@@ ected button will be download as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New downlo@@ ad@@ able is available . in this case , the new images have been selected with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , of course , only the new images will be downloaded .
if you use the All Download or Sel@@ ected buttons , a dialog appears where you can select the destination folder where the photos are stored . the list of existing albums is displayed , like normal folder . then , you can read the list of folders in the My Albums section . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ plug ; download the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all by using the Del@@ ete All Del@@ ete button . if you want to delete only some , you have to select them first and then delete the selected delete .
please note that there is no possibility to recover photos that you deleted from the camera . so you should carefully check if the photos were successfully downloaded into a &amp; digi@@ plug ; -@@ album before you want to delete them from the camera . if you want to delete the camera cher completely , you should do so via the camera &apos;s menu , as this is much faster .
the file names are usually used again after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can lead to double file names if you upload photos from different recording locations to the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image was made into the file name .
in the next section , you will find options for turning and mirr@@ oring the image and for dat@@ ed@@ res@@ ins . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created automatically per day .
the options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three more options that are executed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two relate the data about the author in the section Standard Car Identi@@ ty . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the Ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
for example , if you want another date format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix fot@@ o- % Y@@ - % % d % H : % M : % S . turn on the date &amp; time option . for more customiz@@ ations , you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command .
if you use the option camera file name , you have the possibility to change the file names in lower case letters when downloading . or in capital letters , if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , which &amp; digi@@ code ; used for a photo , is shown below the name that the camera provides in preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and used automatically when you next open the camera window .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera at the time of shooting to make an automatic rotation during the download . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar Met@@ adata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic turn is usually turned on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t provide this information , it lets &amp; digi@@ plug ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the automatic turn in the bottom of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date that the photo was made , it can be used to automatically create sub @-@ albums on the target album . all images with the same date are uploaded to the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ a @-@ data section , you can read which information your camera might have embedded in the photos .
this option is usually switched off , and in this case , &amp; digi@@ plug ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based lower at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the download button . then select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files you want to upload . you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; you where the pictures should be uploaded . select a folder selection dialog for the camera . select here the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a generic term in this document . this refers to a position indicated in length and width graph and which can be displayed on a map . the data can be determined by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographic location . not everyone uses an airplane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this capability .
if you have forgotten where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser that shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ plug ; users who want to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that exi@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields such as direction , saddle and card references . there are at least three ways to achieve this . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , about a post @-@ processing of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic assignment ( manual ) and last about the manual entry of known sites .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that integrates a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS receivers . either as card module or by transmitting data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you must save this data in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format supported by the geographic assignment module .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and the GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the l@@ ati@@ tude and l@@ ati@@ tude or other data , you can use this script which works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool of Phil Harv@@ ey . it uses the signs ha@@ iry coordinates that are created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , showing all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; tries to give you as much control over its work processes as possible . there are many settings that digi@@ plug the behavior of &amp; digi@@ plug . to access these settings , you need to select the Edit menu ; set up . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons on the left .
select action can be displayed on embedded preview or start image editing . you can set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ plug ; specify when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the appropriate IP@@ TC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface .
this field should be a photographer , freelance photographer , or an independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author field , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo that the photo offers . this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be listed here as they offer the picture to others &amp; quot ; .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the appropriate IP@@ TC platform . this ensures that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the digi@@ plug database ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be digi@@ ti@@ zed without going lost .
cap@@ tions as embedded labels ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images store : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the images . this allows your cap@@ tions to be read from other picture viewers .
the settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse cursor is in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ plug ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ code ; to display , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . any file that has none of these extensions , edited &amp; digi@@ BO@@ s ; ignored .
you can reset the default settings again by pressing the button Update to the right of each category .
the settings of the brightness of &amp; digi@@ plug ; can be set on this page to the default values . however , each time you open the lumin@@ aire , these settings are not available . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one , you can get better picture results .
by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed pictures . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the toolbar if you use the image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in image processing , this View Mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling means that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for more information .
using P@@ NG compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality , since P@@ NG requires a loss@@ less algorithm . the only effect is that the image data takes more time to expand and un@@ pack . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression .
with the option to comp@@ ress TI@@ FF files , you can turn the de@@ late compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of TI@@ FF images . it does not affect image quality , because the de@@ late algorithm works loss@@ less .
with the setting of loss@@ less JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss@@ less . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG . when this paragraph is written , metadata has not yet been supported , but was in the planning .
in earlier versions of digi@@ plug , image processing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it is quickly becoming a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image processing .
the standard assumption is that all green pixels are equal . if the straight @-@ line green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensi@@ tively to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels in odd lines , this difference creates a lat@@ tice pattern in output . this option records the picture a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 lat@@ tice pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the Automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard it is a solid color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights . for other cameras , this option is ignored .
the default is the top lights , so the parts of your pictures are burned out due to the inability of your camera to capture the top lights as a continuous white . use the setting colors to trigger some unusual results , since it shows the top lights in various shades of rose . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights .
this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red . and d@@ rap@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct missing green and red portions from the still un@@ saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want .
when you select the re@@ constructing option , you will get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can / should be individually adapted for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can be done later in the image options of the digi@@ plug ; -@@ picture editing . in order to keep the time for the demo invo@@ icing , you should proceed conservative .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the partial raw data that comes from the color @-@ filtered image sensor that many cameras have and which makes a matrix of colored pixels available . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&amp; D@@ rap@@ w provide you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like this . V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ rap@@ w . however , it creates color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with acceptable results .
if you know the color deviation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color sof@@ tening correction , as it is performed during the shell conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions such as these should be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ BO@@ s ; information on how to translate the color information from a color space in the other , so that the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions when an image is opened in image processing / start color management module with raw files .
color Profile folder Set here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ cam ; will then examine these folders during startup .
settings of ICC profiles You have here the possibility &amp; quot ; default quality ; for your profiles . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures color @-@ administr@@ ated not the entire screen .
the input profiles should fit the camera manufacturer and model you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain any color ton@@ ics mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ rap@@ w G@@ amma is not corrected for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth .
there are other options such as the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , which allows you to em@@ ulate how your picture would be returned from a device . this is very useful before you can print a picture as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated . this could be manually corrected , rather than rel@@ ying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it &apos;s pretty obvious which color profile is intended for . unfortunately not with the models from Canon . hence , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course , this answer is un@@ official :
the Canon profile extension leaves the style for the goal : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image editing . by deplo@@ ying this interface , &amp; digi@@ plug ; many modules that were written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use , and these will then be loaded by &amp; digi@@ cam ; these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition , you will also find some in the context menu of the preview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the Settings menu &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Settings &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained through the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper regulator adjust@@ s the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the ad .
the camera features show on the left a list of all the currently supported cameras . on the right @-@ hand side there is a button Automatic detection which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . below are the port settings . below are the port settings . currently , Seri@@ al , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage are supported .
at the bottom you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you select a USB or Fire@@ Wire stream camera from the camera list .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn on .
if not , you can set the camera model and port manually . once you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera , which is displayed in the main window &apos;s menu . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the option &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ firm dialog for moving images to the M@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you will be able to edit &amp; digi@@ plug the dialog ; if you delete a photo in an album , you will find more details in the sections &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Del@@ ete a photo and delete an album &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly activated by &amp; digi@@ plug ; apply if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without re@@ questioning . otherwise , you will need to save the changes using the button changes .
you can also disable &amp; digi@@ plug the display of the welcome screen ; under certain circumstances , this acceler@@ ates the start process of digi@@ plug ; .

different color schemes can be edited in &amp; digi@@ BO@@ ; used to customize the main window to suit your taste . these settings can be selected using Settings Design from the toolbar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ plug ; to create , you will find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; includes a quick picture editing with some basic tools . you can use these to view your photos and for correc@@ ting and improving . image editing can be started by one click with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selection of the item A@@ ds / Edit .
image editing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ plug , so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see the section Image Processing section .
a status line at the bottom of the window displaying the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file number , enlar@@ ging factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently used functions .
the editing functions of image editing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before using File saving or the Save button from the toolbar . note that you can no longer recover the original photo once you have saved the image .
you might need to make a copy of your image before you change it . you can do so with File Sav@@ ing as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by restoring or using the button The Rest@@ ore the Image Processing button in the toolbar . you will then lose any change you have done in the photo since the last storage .
nearly every action of image editing can be und@@ one or restored . the last action can be und@@ one by selecting Edit Re@@ c or Rest@@ ore by selecting Rest@@ ore from the menu .
if you frequently use this , use the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z for und@@ o and note C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press the Return or Rest@@ ore button in the toolbar for a moment , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu items , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started the image editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , picture high , picture or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them .
you can zoom in and out in the photo where you use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : choose the magni@@ fication factor automatically
view Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . if you do not want this , you can view this in the Edit menu &amp; Edit . you can view it from &amp; digi@@ plug ; main window . see the section for setting up image processing .
if you want to print the current image , you can select the image in the File menu and get the Standard &amp; k@@ de ; Print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual images or whole sentences . whole picture templates can be prin@@ tet from your selection . you only have to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu Album Ex@@ por@@ tioning Print As@@ sist . if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; main window has a side@@ bar on the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation arrows , also in image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicking on the same tab allows the side@@ bar to appear or disappear to the edge .
the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label field in other applications , you should consider these limitations .
after you have commented it , use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions will then be saved .
next to the application button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always done when you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the images .
the evaluation section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars into the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select them and use the context menu .
the rating is written in the Ur@@ gency IP@@ TC field . the code follows the schema in the following table :
the keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used previously ; -@@ session applied keywords .
the keyword is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can quickly restrict the number of options when searching for a keyword . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering random keywords in a series of images . if you have entered different keywords , these are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set in the tree by checking the corresponding check boxes . all keywords of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC @-@ field keyword .
if you select multiple images in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please refer to the Key@@ word Key@@ word section .
the Key@@ word Key@@ word Filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side@@ bar is used with their Album , - Date , keyword and search views . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all generated keywords are available .
you can also drag and drop keywords . in the main view , suppose you have selected several images to provide you with keywords . if the keyword is already existing , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and select it . then a dialog appears asking if you want to set the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day . the keyword is on No keywords , which reduces the amount to three pictures . they were selected using C@@ trl + a , and after that a keyword has been drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there . a dialog promp@@ ts whether this keyword should be set .
this search for changes takes place at each start of the program . it can also be disabled on Settings Mis@@ cellaneous .
if you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or two , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , key word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator that is a name or string that is already in the database .
for example , you can specify an Advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the group button . the options then look like this :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web and Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? free disk space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution there .

the reason you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable vari@@ ance of the actual photographed or scanned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that correspond to the colors you print or publish in the web to those from your digital dark room .
when the topic comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at every point in the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions so that you can get the desired result .
if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
your only other picture issues are email or web where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life for everyone so easy , why should you use a different color space and thus have to worry about color management ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all the colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I need to crash my monitor if I decided to work only in s@@ RGB color space ?
yes ! whether you are working in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to k@@ alli@@ ze your monitor , since s@@ RGB causes your monitor to be rec@@ ali@@ br@@ ated . if you are working as the color space of s@@ RGB , you either need to calibr@@ ate your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve one image in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual processing .
the functions norm@@ alize , synchron@@ ize , automatic balance and contrast extend from the menu Cor@@ rection Automatic correction try automatically to make the best of your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the lumin@@ ance values over the entire image , so that the dark@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or out @-@ washed .
compar@@ isons : this method adjust@@ s the lumin@@ ous re@@ actor of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . it sometimes achieves very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only garbage . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in an image or destro@@ ys it .
automatic balancing : this method maxim@@ izes color range in the red , green and blue channel . it detects the dark and light boundary tones and adjust@@ s the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range .
adding Con@@ trast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and a new adjustment of all values in between . this is only visible with balanced pictures and can be a good correction for poor photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ BO@@ s ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is a bit limited because of a color space with 8 @-@ bits per color . if you can do so far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can do the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by copyright by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it using the menu item Col@@ ors White Balance of Image Processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image . the preview will dynamically adjust the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance , click on the sub @-@ window .
the preview of the target photos has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel below this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
right above , a hist@@ ogram shows that dynamically changing as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or the sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . shadow Ali@@ gn@@ ment lets you improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos .
to play with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the Pre@@ ferences list . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will see the combined result in white balance . this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Save As and Load &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; buttons make this exactly . any setting of the white balance you set you can save to a text file and load them again later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Pre@@ ferences knob re@@ stores all filter values to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that neutral settings will also result in a different photo than your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed .
you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image here . 8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high quality images . this coding also requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color ton@@ ics can be done by the sub @-@ window for the brightness . a detailed guide for using color profiles can consult the chapter on color management .
this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously and allows you to save your settings so that you can use them for multiple photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always need the same error and therefore you will always need the same correction .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find in color gra@@ dation in the menu .
the digi@@ plug ; tool color effects provide you with four colour effects , a solar energy effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation was also known as Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect that was created when a partially developed pressure replaced a short flash light . the colored , darker areas protected the delicate photo paper from the additional light . this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second lighting . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely .
the intensity controls the pol@@ arization . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment finally generates a negative picture so that it cannot be produced on photographic paper .
this is an example of the solar energy effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that edi@@ ts the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . just try it , it beauti@@ fies many photos .
Vel@@ via is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Media aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts . the characteristics make it a film of choice for wildlife photographers . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated colors are too much for some photographers , especially those who have hardly any landscapes .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and lumin@@ osity of the photos . you can experiment to look at the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the result use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you make a photo in poor light conditions , you can get the reverse problem : a too big satur@@ ation . even in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex mold gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool ton@@ er correction is located to improve the exposure . even if the dialogue to this tool works very complicated , you only need the area of sli@@ der for the use purpose described here .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected range . below the graph three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the controller and make sure that the image changes .
on the right , the original and the preview of the image can be viewed . the preview will be dynamic , based on the settings of the image . the following options are available on the left @-@ hand side .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it can be set whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic y axis . for images of a digital camera the linear hist@@ ogram is often dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic classification is more useful .
three kno@@ bs : the upper one for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma values .
the three color pin@@ pet@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the entries of shadows , medium and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as with the input values . for example , the compression of the output values can be used to create a light image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground .
automatic : with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and loaded again later . for this purpose , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input value is automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels .
the Over@@ all Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , that means you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect at the final result .
below you see an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
the left @-@ hand side shows half of the original and the target image . the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modified channel : this selection box allows the channel to be specified by the module :
in addition to this box there are two icons to switch between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for images taken with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most useful . for images with large areas of a constant color , the linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode also helps .
for example , if you move a short arrow to the right , for example the bright tones , you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and that the associated image pixels become darker .
a red marker is shown on the preview of the original photos . if you want to change this selection to the area you want to change , a matching line appears on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it down and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve that you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p Cur@@ ve format .
if you use this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes buttons automatically create the check@@ points of the curve for all channels of shadow , mid@@ - and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the Over@@ all Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , that means you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect at the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ plug &apos;s channel mixer ; image editing is a tool to enhance the color channels or change the color shades of the photo .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing .
with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first notice how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left part of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed by comparison with your own tab .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to display the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are at the bottom right : controls for red , green and construction permit you to mix these channels . if you activate lumin@@ ance , the image will also retain the overall brightness as the channel mixer is then THE tool for generating great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour space . it consists of small noise art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear in the same place in the color channel and whose noise patterns appear differently in each channel . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by reducing the color noise first .
the Save As and Load Buttons are used for this purpose . any mixer setting can be saved for later and then loaded . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the Over@@ all Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , that means you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect at the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the Blue channel has been read@@ just@@ ed . the option L@@ umin@@ ance Store is enabled . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your ability to abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography black / white is a work step because color images can easily be converted on the computer . also with a set of film rolls profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky .
Oran@@ ge@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure using a red lens filter . this creates dramatic sky @-@ effects and can simulate lun@@ ar scenes at the time of the day . similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure using a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ ece : produces warm light and medium tones as it adds a bit of cold in the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of ble@@ aching a pressure and re@@ development in a s@@ epi@@ ped pad . this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) s@@ epi@@ ece filter .
with &amp; digi@@ plug ; apply tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image .
by adding a texture to your picture , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can let it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the engraving of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall picture on a wall . the menu entry Image texture apply to image processing can be used for it .
relief : post@@ p@@ one this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper text effect is applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to see . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool box Add a decorative frame to add an image .
keeping the eye of a be@@ holder in the boundaries of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep one &apos;s attention is to set the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
type : with this parameter you can adjust the desired frame type for your picture . the image bor@@ dered with a coloured line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ and @-@ white pictures ) , finishes it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame , which is ideal for a kno@@ ck effect and decorative frame with patterns added .
width : specifies the width of the frame in percent . the range of value for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image , decorated with the frame , will be bigger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have previously used the tool After aspect ratio .
with this handy tool , you can insert simple a format@@ ted text into an image at any place . this also works at several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it . the bigger the picture , the greater the character set . to conclude , simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
every setting you selected for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; OK . &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed any more .
with &amp; digi@@ plug ; apply tool template you can put a template over a picture .
the Image template used in image editing can be used to create templates over a picture .
for the template there are no limitations concerning size and orientation . however , you need to take the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to minimize the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to digi@@ plug @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the button Basic Fol@@ der in dialog . select the folder where you have copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . the selection of a folder will automatically update the preview strip of the templates .
under the preview you can find three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and position of your image .
enlarge : this knob increases the displayed image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shrink : this button res@@ umes the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . to do so , take the image and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adjusted automatically to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but generates gra@@ iny images especially in dark areas .
we can use it to remove atmospheric dun@@ st and it does a really good job . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is perhaps the best of the three since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adjust .
images without focus as well as most digi@@ ti@@ zed images need a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because of the digi@@ tization process colors with only minimal differences to form a color point . this in turn causes sharp edges to merge into a common color . this again causes sharp edges to be printed together . S@@ LR cameras normally require more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for the home user .
JPEG images often have a camera internal sharpen@@ ing . images in raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some scann@@ ers use a focus filter while reading the image . if you disable this , you will get control of your image .
in some situations you can get usable results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing tool . this allows you to use the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ting Sever@@ al .
however , you should be careful because the results do not work very naturally : the sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also rein@@ forces the noise . in general , the most useful technique to shar@@ pen an image will re@@ focus the tool . by re@@ focusing , you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too crisp . the solution to draw the picture a little bit sof@@ tly is much easier than to shar@@ pen it . use the tool for soft character with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ting soft@@ keys and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ inten@@ sely mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview will help you to edit the image . the preview window will display the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tried first . an increase of radius or amount increases the effect .
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , you should best shar@@ pen images in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped image which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference amount to be applied . thus , it is possible to define a minimum difference thus for an edge of the filter . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from sharpen@@ ing and therefore avoid beauty errors in faces , an@@ an@@ ties and water surfaces .
this is an example for the blur@@ red mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . blur@@ red mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 .
the digi@@ plug ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focused an image by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright protected design algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Vienna Fil@@ tr@@ ation . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Vienna Filter . re@@ focusing usually results in better results than blur@@ red mask . you can start it from the menu by re @-@ focusing colors in image processing .
in practice , the circular folding works much better than the G@@ auss &apos;s folding . the G@@ auss &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which causes the mathematical result also from the source pix@@ iles , which are far from the original source pixel . in most cases , the FI@@ R Vienna In@@ verse of the G@@ auss &apos;s folding is even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels . this causes un@@ desirable results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular fold . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images the default value should result in good results . you can set a higher value if your picture is blur@@ red then pay attention to hal@@ o notes .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very poor .
G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your sharp@@ ness Gau@@ ß is . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a non@@ zero value , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
die Size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase of the die size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular focus or the G@@ auss . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save As and Load Buttons are used for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to make all the trimm@@ ing , color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations make changes that are not visible immediately , but leave some unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts later .
when you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
in general , un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by the blur@@ red mas@@ king a larger neighborhood used as sharpen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically un@@ sharp mask must always produce art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blur@@ ring . for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal lens filter . practically the result of the FI@@ R Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blur@@ ring mask . the FI@@ R Viennese filter is often better in processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused image :
this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the sharp@@ ness correction methods , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the smoo@@ th@@ ness controls the bl@@ ur of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink ink allows a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , you can adjust this here .
the image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove un@@ desired arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the tab smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detail conservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of details . a small value leads to an even smoo@@ th@@ ness over the picture . whereas larger values mainly smooth homogeneous regions and let details sharp . a value of 0.@@ 9 should get details in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary .
directional depen@@ dency Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes in all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ulation or CCD Rau@@ schen a high value wave @-@ like patterns will generate . JPEG &apos;s art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 .
smoo@@ thing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all@@ . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore set this value to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary when very much noise is present , because it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is going through . normally , here is 1 or 2 .
angle @-@ width since &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is chosen small , it should be cho@@ osen too small . make sure that small angles create a long run@@ time . so , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs .
integrated step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integrated step width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never larger than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the more of the quality you receive by selecting this option is minimal , but it doubles the run@@ time . we recommend it therefore to om@@ it it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Save As and Load &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; buttons make this exactly . any setting of image errors can be saved to a text file and loaded again later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
correc@@ ting graphical errors is relatively fast at work . however , it can take a long time and draw a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Canc@@ el button .
below you can see how image errors can be corrected with small arti@@ facts . the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a peculiar black arti@@ fact in the foreground that caused by poor film storage during the trip . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts that come from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; -@@ effects of scanned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot at the top shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub @-@ window details and the Advanced Settings panel can remain with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time that the filter needs per pixel and can bl@@ ur the image . the area indicated by the radius is smoo@@ thed over the image and the color in it is smoo@@ thed and therefore smaller bugs removed .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel pitch behind the filter to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if it is increased , noise peaks are deleted . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be obtained and noise or lubrication occurs again .
edges : controls edge accuracy for sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong it cannot be removed the entire noise or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak his@@ sing or j@@ peg arti@@ facts without losing any details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend to change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend to change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ eplay tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas , which are typically more severe , but also mer@@ ges the shadow areas .
d@@ amping : controls the adjustment of the phase j@@ itter d@@ amping . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is raised , the edges appear smoo@@ ther if it is too high . if it is at its minimum , noise and phase j@@ itter may appear on the edges . it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for it .
store under and load : these buttons are used exactly for this purpose . all parameters for the noise reduction you set can be saved to the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose . fortunately , the solution to draw the picture a little bit sof@@ tly is fortunately much easier than to shar@@ pen a picture . use the tool for soft character with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ting soft@@ keys and experiment with the smoo@@ thing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the digi@@ plug ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film gra@@ ining , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that appear in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images .
the same algorithm can be used for color and texture replacement . the texture mapping is performed with another tool , image error correction . the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG &apos;s art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a loss@@ less compression algorithm , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ ef@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Save As and Load &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; buttons make this exactly . any setting of photo restoration can be saved to a text file and loaded again later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo restoration is relatively fast at work . however , it can take a long time and draw a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish .
below you can be restored like a photo with uni@@ form@@ ly noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera to an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film bas@@ kets on the faces .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures were applied to an old color photo that was read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts caused by the scanner illumination and the photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project that are copy@@ righ@@ ted by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels quot ; and &apos; quot ; Light pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark picture sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
load this file into the wizard with the button dark image . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the matching dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wizard will notice the last dark picture and will automatically load it in the next session .
the image area and preview will help you correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
select an area around the broken pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixels . these are the available filters :
average : an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the faulty pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to comp@@ ute a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to comp@@ ute a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the faulty pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a faulty digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is shown under ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ plug ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image .
wide @-@ angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range evenly . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ te@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior .
but it also has disadvantages . many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter , which may increase the necessary shutter speed under certain circumstances , which makes it impossible to use the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also use a center filter , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller as otherwise blur@@ red effects arise through motion .
with the large exposure ranges of today &apos;s fil@@ mic and grey scale depth of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a blank image without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting Cor@@ rection applies the transformation using a C@@ enter@@ filter to a picture . the algorithm is copy@@ righ@@ ted by John Walker .
with three regul@@ ators you can control the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction filter and with three more exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the largest density of the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which compens@@ ates for an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1 , or at random a light intensity of 2 . increase the density by a larger degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting , reduce it to compensate for a small degree .
brightness , Con@@ trast and G@@ amma Settings : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction decreases the brightness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide positive values , since you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a more fine read@@ just@@ ing of the exposure of the target image , leave the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the Edit menu ; image processing from the Color Gra@@ dation menu .
this is an example of the correction correction applied to an image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture .
the digi@@ plug ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar circular effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s at the edges . this correction is not applied in the mold .
the coefficient of fourth gra@@ dient correc@@ ts the remote corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can almost be eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of the distortion second gra@@ dient . with negative values , sound @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth degree . this value acts more strongly at the margins than in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner parameter has the reverse character of the parameter .
zoom : this value res@@ umes the image size and thus results in correction of the first gra@@ dient . negative values increase while positive the image decreases .
brigh@@ ten : this value adjust@@ s the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase them .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog provides a preview of the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start .
the t@@ onal or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or res@@ izing changes . the best way to do this is to perform this correction as the first one . if you re@@ open a picture and then perform a barrel @-@ shaped correction , the effect would be apparent .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal help line . move the mouse cursor in the image preview to display the dotted lines . move it to an important place , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . subsequently , you can correct the barrel / cushion distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove it using the blan@@ king tool in the Trans@@ former Editor menu , or via the Zoom controller of this dialog .
the next logical step for some motives , e.g. shots from the front , frame and paintings , it is the perspective to correct that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera by hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective .
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method of simul@@ ating infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ ra feature film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left of the window you can select the area for the preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can set two parameters for film gra@@ ding and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the merge option if you want to simulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator changes the amount of film grains and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in conversion . green meadows are white like snow !
since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the top lights .
the digi@@ plug ; filter film is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool for re@@ producing film bas@@ kets on your pictures . this is known from classical high @-@ speed films such as B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the makers mix large silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film gra@@ vit@@ ational effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere from everyday life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gran@@ ular sight especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you need to use this filter .
the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , set to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film gra@@ ining effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the digi@@ plug ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the digi@@ plug ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
the upper one sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brushes are better suited for large images . smoo@@ th@@ ness controls the smoo@@ th@@ ness or , viewed from the other side , the sharp@@ ness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the processor is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel wide image is 1 and smoo@@ th@@ 17 .
the digi@@ plug ; filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a coal cap . images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to sket@@ ch yourself . this would be good pictures to start .
there are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob chooses the pin size and the lower knob adjust@@ s the contrast ( smoo@@ thing ) .
this is an example of the char@@ coal drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed picture ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the digi@@ plug ; filter engraving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the digi@@ plug ; filter engraving is a fast tool to give your pictures a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , where color is not the most important in content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a gray , mon@@ dar@@ y landscape .
the depth allows to set the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is considered through glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wavel@@ ength 1 , the image is distorted using another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and produce a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the Be@@ aming button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using bl@@ ur effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines that run from one centre . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
motion blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image through horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train taking photos , camera .
sof@@ tening blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image sof@@ tly in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the picture through a random shift of the pixels and simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur : finds the bas@@ ins in the picture and blur@@ red them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divide the photo into rectangular cells and then recre@@ ate it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time with the Be@@ aming button .
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool for making rain@@ drops on your picture . this makes it natural to your pictures a wet look . it uses a patented Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm .
dri@@ p size allows to change the size of drops . since the dri@@ p size does not automatically increase with the size of the image , it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of drops in the picture .
you can with &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing keep an area free of rain@@ drops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you start the filter rain@@ drops , the area will remain free of rain@@ drops .
this is an example of the rain@@ drops filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture ( 2 ) suggests a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can place it in the right direction by mirr@@ oring or turning . the tools for this can be found in the Trans@@ former Rot@@ ating or Transform@@ ers menu .
blowing photo is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo at a minimum loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom in an image when the boundaries of the resolution are reached ? how can you restore or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select transforming size in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is visible below .
the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to increase a small picture with better quality , then try the tool to blow up .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ plug ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo bubbles was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you have to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the new size tab and are listed below :
maintain aspect ratio : when this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image is maintained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary when very much noise is present , because it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Save As and Load &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; buttons are used for this purpose . any em@@ ulation for photo magni@@ fication can be saved as text file and loaded again later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
blowing photo is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long time and draw a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish .
you can see below an example for photo bubbles by enlar@@ ging a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magni@@ fication for comparison .
trimm@@ ing a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a commonly under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . in order to cut a photo , simply click the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drawing up the rect@@ angle , you will see this rect@@ angle as you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again , the area of the photo will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo looks like after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by simply clicking on the corners of the rect@@ angle .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The C@@ utting button of image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the file Save or File Save as in the File menu to save the newly cut photo .
in the preview section you can change the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog remains unchanged .
in the tool Fol@@ lowing aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format . in portrait mode , the greater value of height and width is always assigned to the width .
the tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimet@@ res , inches or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog two buttons exist to center the selection automatically horizontally or vertically .
at the bottom of the dialog you can use the Max . ratio button to cut the area to the highest possible depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool After aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( horizontal or vertical ) . if you use the cutting tool next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the modified image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image .
the setting up aid settings allow you to blend aids so that you can put your pictures together better . these aids are :
harmonic triangle : harmonic divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ country re@@ ins , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to share a rect@@ angle in a similarly harmonious tri@@ angles at the diag@@ onal .
golden center : the golden center is a division which affects various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us Mus@@ cle or the flower leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things we perceive as beautiful .
the golden partition is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number deri@@ ves from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; the resulting divi@@ der is equal to 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle .
the golden center provides more fluid guides when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
the Golden spiral will give you good results for your photos . compared to the third rule , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition guides the observer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual river in this way .
a further rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . there should be something that distra@@ cts the eye to the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the Golden Tri@@ angles also derive from the golden spiral discussed above . your verti@@ ces are the center points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that unlike harmonic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equ@@ il@@ ateral tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to these lines can be released a static object more dynamic .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise .
the horizontal mirr@@ oring and vertical mirr@@ oring options can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions .
with the button color you can set the color of the help lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the help lines can become invisible . in this way , you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
when you make a photo , it happens easily that you do not hold the camera exactly vertically or horizontally . this creates a picture in which the things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can do this with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing and the tool free rotation . select Transform@@ ers Free Rotation and adjust the target angle .
rotate your picture with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are given in degrees . with the button Pre@@ ferences you can reset the sli@@ der to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the upper right .
for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines . after you moved it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after you shot an image you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the Trans@@ forming function from image processing .
an elegant way to crop the image is to slice Automati@@ cally . select one of the following options :
the Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing option smoo@@ thes the picture a bit after the turn . however , keep in mind the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tival transform@@ ations are performed by a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by transformation , in pixels .
angle to the top left : indicates the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle on the right : indicates the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle to the left : indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right below : indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the picture is slightly s@@ me@@ ared . this effect is small for a single adjustment , but two adjustments create a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adjusted the perspective , you get un@@ happy tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean this is to cut the picture with transformer cores from the image processing .
a horizontal she@@ ar , for example , will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the bottom part to the left . this is no rotation , the image is distorted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via transformation scissors .
rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview window .
to your help , a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the locking tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sc@@ aling , the picture is a bit blur@@ red . for a single shot , this effect is mostly neg@@ li@@ gible , but two sh@@ ear@@ ings produce twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after the sc@@ aling , the picture has tri@@ angular tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate this is to cut the picture with transformer cores from the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , of the way these libraries are compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ plug .
because of this depen@@ dency on other libraries it is impossible to make a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF below .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; displays only files in formats that know . this happens by means of the file extension and a comparison of these with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , it will change the file in image processing . you can change this list of file extensions that &amp; digi@@ BO@@ s ; Acc@@ ep@@ ted . in the Con@@ figuration section , you will find more information about this .
nearly all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found on Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ plug ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression techniques to digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG for the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss@@ less if it is stated in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the shell image format , see Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful guides in English . you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TI@@ FF with the Video Converter of &amp; digi@@ plug ; in the Con@@ figuration section , you will find further information on how to use modules with &amp; digi@@ plug ; .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; supports loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ BO@@ .@@ With this , more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all support cameras can be viewed at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coff@@ in .
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often recorded in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ plug ; but is not a film editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in possibilities to view or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ plug ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playing movies use the program to start playing .

K@@ IP@@ I module exports a series of images to a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth .
if you change steps 4 and 5 what you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good then you can do the first four adjusting with the white balance module .
many tools that you need to edit the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ code ; included . your description follows here .
all image processing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , soft characters , noise suppression , re@@ focusing , blur@@ ring , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog box that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture apply ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image . to the left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
the left pane displays the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected for@@ esi@@ ght .
horizontal parts without dup@@ licate . the upper section shows the original and the bottom shows the filter applied to the area below the selected foam area .
the left section shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper section shows the original and the bottom to compare the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the preview section and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame for selecting the preview . you can drag this box with the mouse inside the picture and put it on the part of the image from which you want to preview the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module will be noted .
the Properties page shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo characteristics : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data come from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini program . you can zoom in or out using the mouse wheel . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this requires , of course , that your images contain ge@@ o @-@ data .
&amp; k@@ olo@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the pallets stored by &amp; k@@ de can apply either for the entire system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors .
in the dialog box , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders for files .
the cursor is displayed as a line in the palette view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the color beside it . the color is described in the palette view . here the color name can also be changed .
to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor to it . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box B@@ m C@@ ursor is activated under the button color , the color is inserted from the color table on the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes a different ; depending on whether the cursor is selected over@@ writing . this mode you can set by selecting the check box over@@ writing under Bei@@ m C@@ ursor .
a selection , which was created as described in the last section , can be used in conjunction with the actions copying , cut and paste .
&amp; k@@ olo@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line ending sign , if another color follows . if there are three figures in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ;
the colors in the palette and the selection of the color selection can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color sel@@ ector on the left .
&amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there has been no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs that include &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; programs with only a few functions have been out@@ dated according to the program author .
the &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graphi@@ c@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Gra@@ ph . &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphi@@ c@@ viewer ; shows graph with all the options of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration into &amp; Po@@ sters ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in the graph in &amp; kate ; re@@ counting the graph and in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ c@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; posters ; to open or to open the graph in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ c@@ viewer ; in a &amp; kate ; component
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems starting from around 1000 no@@ des and a h@@ ack to represent more than these no@@ des )
further required software : &amp; k@@ graphi@@ c@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for displaying the graphs . requires in detail :
the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub @-@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graphi@@ c@@ viewer ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot . in this case , the toolbar only contains the symbol file and the ( empty ) list Rec@@ ently opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
after selecting one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the bottom of the screen :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( up and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt key ; -@@ key ) ;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by a factor of 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the uploaded file has been changed by another program , the following window will appear :
you can choose whether the graph is to be re@@ charged or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphi@@ c@@ viewer ; can also remember your decision , so that later will proceed as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can set up the menu item Settings c@@ et@@ viewer ; set ... , see also .
if you open a graph file outside of a running &amp; node instance , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphi@@ c@@ viewer ; instance or to display the graphs to be loaded in a sub @-@ window of the current instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog .
at program start , you can re@@ open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice as well as change later .
you can also specify how the graph is to be split into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the sections of the graph coming to one page will be adjusted to this page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph .
page preview with a page distributed on several pages without header and with another font
the Er@@ ne@@ ut Load page gives the ability to specify behavior when a file has been changed on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or let the program ask for each time .
the opening page gives the ability to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ c@@ viewer ; specify when a graph is opened outside a running session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub @-@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is requested .
the session management page gives the possibility to specify the start behaviour of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ c@@ viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session ) or decide to be asked at every start .
the context menu , which usually appears at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , opens up additional options :
here you can choose from various &amp; graphi@@ c@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries described on the &amp; Graph@@ vi@@ z website are :
the algorithm puts the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overl@@ aps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ ic@@ ol@@ oured graphs . it produces representations based on the spring@@ spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .

the K@@ IP@@ I Module to read images provides tools to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the San@@ e project or another source such as video streams . to make this work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you open the menu entry images , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to fetch the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears in that you can replace your default duc@@ ts to select your image accordingly . see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you press the button scanning the image . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information .
make sure that the window is completely displayed , as some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
after you have pushed the button scanning , you wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the options of the target image appears . here you can specify the compression and type of the image file . please remember that type BM@@ P does not comp@@ ress and therefore create very large files . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; to save it by saving the image .
you can create screen@@ shots after you have selected the screen shot in the Import &gt; screen shot menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so that you can view other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ space .
the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other work areas , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there .
after the screen@@ shot has been created , the dialog box displays the options of the target image with the options described above .

Fli@@ ck@@ r makes it possible to send your photos to people who are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world , make photos of your camera mobile online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world .
the Export module to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
if you use the module for the first time you will be guided through the process of generating a token . this will be used for your authentication . it is thus virtually your ID to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so that you can log in at Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after successful login , the module can send photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r website . the following page will be presented to you after a successful login .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after pressing Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
if the Export module is started to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which shows the current access per@@ missions that the module displays . currently , the module does not support any other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to proceed with these per@@ missions .
the button to add photos should be pressed once you have set all the other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . if you press the O@@ k button , upload the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r server .
the keyword field can be filled with a comm@@ a separated list of words . these are added to the image as the keywords during the upload .
with the Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie options , you can set the access per@@ missions to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you select the option Change the size of the photos before upload , the photos will be changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value entered at maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed in such a way that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Galerie export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Gallery Export has no documentation at the moment . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Res@@ p@@ ect : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows you to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools for loc@@ ating images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and width degrees are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and enter the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears then . in order to run a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you must load a track file with GP@@ X file . this file contains of course data that were recorded at the same time at the same locations as the images of your camera .
if the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed which shows the coordinates in red . GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone .
the setting for maximum time deviation indicates an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time . if the deviation is below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you don &apos;t have trace data from a place for images , you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add it to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you have no matching dates . if you know that in reality a location is located in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then push the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos in the same place . since the dialog is changing the coordinates from one call to the next you only need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and placed with the displayed map . select the region in question and zoom in . enter it again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the map can be switched between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Photo Gallery is a tool for ex@@ porting a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums which are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set will be enco@@ ded by U@@ TF @-@ 8 to provide the best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted . the Ri@@ der selection allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML . the albums are not displayed hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums .
the tab Ap@@ pear@@ ance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . the option For each picture creates a page creating a gallery in which each image will also get a page . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show
the Ri@@ der Album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all of your associated images . select a folder where you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG image format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images .
you can change the default color depth with other color depth . this naturally also influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the thumb@@ nail tab allows you to adjust some of the settings from the Album rider for thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . therefore , you can read the program messages to see if errors occurred during the creation . the web browser will be automatically started at the end to preview the gallery .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool for viewing images .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as turning , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons . it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is shown by default in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less Module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
this module allows to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases , since no compression of the color information takes place . this can be found e.g. in the P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Digital Camera Client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client has no documentation at the moment . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Res@@ p@@ ect : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the Import function of the metadata module you can copy data from one image to another . select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the import function . this will then open the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere but not in any target format . JPEG is supported while writing . please look at exi@@ v2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG En@@ coding module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG @-@ encoder module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages . you can also add an audio file to the MP@@ 2 or WAV of Sli@@ deshow .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can select a background color for slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD Player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
first , you need to select the images to be packed into the MPEG Sli@@ deshow . after that , you can create the MPEG Sli@@ deshow Creator module to start the module .
the images you have selected are then listed in the portfolio under image files . there you can also modify the images or the content of the list .
the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should specify the time in seconds a picture is displayed . the speed of the image transition is defined below . a low value creates very sudden , a high , very smooth picture change .
the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should leave it black . you can specify the name and path of the generated file by name of the MPEG output file . keep the extension mp@@ g as soon as possible .
if you specify an audio file with the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adjusted all settings to your wishes , you can start producing the movie with the knob . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now quickly or quietly drink a coffee and enjoy the slide show if you are back .
if a suggestion appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages via the button Settings at the bottom .
print Assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together with standard photo prints . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is , for example , useful to enhance or print directly with the Gim@@ p module .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your RAW @-@ format images to one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ rap@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from him is : do not expect from d@@ rap@@ w that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer .
first select the RAW file you want to convert and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window then appears in mode for a single image . with the Pre@@ view button , you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance . the essential parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amps can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch does not have any effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame will remain the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tag@@ ged Image Format , TI@@ FF , retains all the information of your image and uses the loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you plan to frequently process your images or otherwise use it elsewhere , you should not choose the JPEG format , since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is wor@@ sen@@ ed . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el .
the batch editing mode allows you to convert different images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ ride existing files automatically . however , this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can reduce or enlarge the image . in addition , four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 dig@@ its . ) : size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . for example , you can use this option to adjust your image to the screen size .
not proportional : a dispro@@ portion@@ ate size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
print preparation : prepare the image for photo printing . the user can set the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , will be adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
after you started the module , the images window will be displayed with the images selected by you . you can add more images via the button Add images . for the last image you have selected , you will see a preview on the right side .
you can also drag pictures to the picture list and place them there to add the list of images to be sent .
using the button to remove images , the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent .
after you have selected all the images , you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client using the OK button . you only have to add the addresses and the subject . the images you have selected are attached as attachments .
pay attention not to send too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations on the size of sending emails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it .
select your E @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you will need to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below .
if you are using the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments to the images will be added to a text file and attached to the mail .
the P@@ NG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats like TI@@ FF . therefore , you should use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format .
if you select a JPEG image file format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original Excel data will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status messages , in search of errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will be automatically started at the end .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au a window appears with questions like you want to have shown your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL option in the presentation activates very elegant image transitions by using Open@@ GL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphic card because otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the File en@@ ame option ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an endless loop . you can then manually cancel it with Es@@ c .
the option to select images random@@ ly makes sure that the images are displayed in random order . so , not the order of the images is used in the album .
between the images the temporal distance between the images can be set . 1500 mil@@ lis@@ ec@@ onds are 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect .
there are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly , each transition between the images sel@@ ects another effect .
during the slide show you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn it on .
with this tool bar , you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next image and stop the slide show .
on the left lower edge of the screen you can see the current file name , position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .

the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool for setting a picture as background image for the desktop .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop .
as soon as you have ann@@ ot@@ ated your pictures and videos with notes , you can browse with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; browse through them , see picture . as you can see by comparing them with the image , there are now in each group , i.e. in people , places and in group keyword entries .
in the browser window , you will see the categories for which you have entered information as you have provided your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course see the current thumb@@ nails .
when you mouse on the entry persons , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
if you select another person , only the images are displayed on which both persons are to be seen . through this selection method , you can restrict the number of displayed pictures from a few thousand images to a few individual images .
if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can display thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area of action .
in the picture , each person has the same icon in front of her name . you can use &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; however , for each person to save his own thumb@@ nail , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself .
to display pictures next to the names , select the button located on the right side of the toolbar . in the appearing context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can display icons with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have suitable images for your keywords ) .
however , you will need to specify which image is to be displayed for each individual . to do so , you will need to open the image view window ( described in more detail ) and display the image for the corresponding person in the context menu . in the view window , you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
when you call the Search in the main window , a dialog appears , which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog once more .
if you enter a string into the cap@@ tion or description field , the descriptions or descriptions of the images will be searched by this text . if you would like , you can also enter a date after which it is to be searched ; the date can be either a part of the total date , i.e. , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all the pictures for certain names , as you can see in the picture . here , pictures on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the User Manual for &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather want to try functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the home page of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo in case you start &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; start the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ Photo@@ album ; demo . as a result , some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo album .
if you prefer to print out this manual , you will find it on the home page of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar you can see here : . as the name says , this bar shows you data statistics about the images in your database .
you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date will be displayed in the preview window ) and the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select a section of the time line by holding the mouse button down and drag the mouse over the ruler of the time line , i.e. the tim@@ eline . if you select an area , you will only see images of this period in the preview window . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a tim@@ eline bar .
&amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; provides you two ways to create HTML pages with your pictures . one is in &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; integrated and the other as module available ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo album ; integrated version which you can create through the menu File HTML ... can be called .
before creating HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and target . in the following , each area is described more precisely .
first enter the title of the title and a description which should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo album ; HTML example pages you will see an example of these settings .
next , select to create a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file should be created on the overview page . you will find more information about the export files in .
finally , you can choose which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid displaying information that is obvious to the viewer without a description . for example , that all images are from a party .
in this area you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are un@@ ambig@@ uous , which is why this is not specifically addressed .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . this means that those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , do not have any images , for example having a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time you defined . so it can browse your images with low resolution , which results in a lower transmission time . if he wants to get an image bigger he changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting area you specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
for all of your HTML files , select a basic folder and create a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first you need to select the main folder where all your images are saved . this folder will be saved and added next time . this allows you to select the location for all future images . here you can either select a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if they are really all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created will be started . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files you created are not yet in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them there . in order for the import function , see , correctly , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings that have just been described have all of them related to basic folders and URLs . a sub@@ folder will be created in this folder , whose name you specify in the output folder .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo album ; coming together , you may want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . however , if you have already spent a lot of time applying the image information , people on the pictures , recording location , etc . , you will need to work with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work will not do again .
with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file , which you can import others into your database .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or whether the file is only a short@@ cut to images . the advantage of storing all images in the file is that you have all the images together and that you can share this file independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the Export menu ... or along with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are located in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , then the images of the URL you have entered when creating the HTML files are scanned . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described , which you can view from the Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are three choices available to you :
with option Manual in the vicinity of the .@@ k@@ im file , you have to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automati@@ cally copied file near the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most images were already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth comp@@ ressing the files . if you want to do so , simply choose the export file option .
the last option of this page is to limit maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the images in full size since the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
when you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the Import ... menu , will select &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; import the exported database as described in .
the Import wizard consists of four steps . first you have to select which images you want to import , then in which folder the im@@ porting images should be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category people of the file to be imported ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) while this category is in your database . therefore , in the third dialog window , you will be asked what categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories they correspond in your database .
in the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen in the picture .
it has to be easy to browse and view pictures : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you look for example pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will go through the various steps of ( 1 ) inser@@ ting information about your images , over ( 2 ) viewing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program for managing your pictures . however , it has been extended and today it takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about images , but often this also includes videos .
&amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top@@ most folder of its images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in CVS , where you want .
&amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; re@@ members the folder where your images are stored and automatically re@@ stores it at future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo album , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
the menu entry settings k@@ Photo@@ album ; set up ... get to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; in the following section of the user manual , you will learn the different settings .
on the left you can see six different icons that allow you to view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can access by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the desired option .
it has been described in detail how to set different properties for each picture , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog that is used to edit existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a cap@@ tion and a symbol .
sub@@ categories have already been mentioned in the section . in the Options dialog , you can set up complete member groups , i.e. all members of a group at a time in a group , rather than explaining all groups of a member as explained in .
in the list box you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window there is a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; divi@@ des its module system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ BO@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this modular system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface .
the modules can be called via the Module menu . the modules can and will not be described in this manual since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , but are sold separately . however , most modules have a help page , which you can call through the module itself .
since the modules are shared by several applications together , it may be that the modules were tested with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; this is why you should always test new modules first with the demo database before you apply them to your own pictures .
the applications that the modules use in common with K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible for some modules to work with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo album and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications put their pictures into albums : an album is simply a folder . even though &amp; k@@ photo album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates the order for some modules for albums so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album .
simul@@ ating &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , so all the pictures you see at the moment .
in addition to the current album , &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album , the modules also have to pass a list of albums . here goes &amp; k@@ photo album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the contents of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it is used the category you set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category people , &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; so do so , so if you would have selected people to view and pass this on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select modules to load modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are accustomed to using any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and toolbar at the top . at the moment , it does not contain a lot of information , since you do not yet have any information about your images . in the section we will go back to this window , but just click on the picture to show you an overview of all existing pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to provide each image with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons appearing in the picture , etc . you can set each picture individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if for example , shown on all pictures Jes@@ per and all pictures taken in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for browsing and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these notes when using the built @-@ in viewer .
in view , you can see three lists with a text box by enabling people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo album , since you will always be able to use them when you enter information about your images .
the following idea is based on moving images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are depicted , you can , because the names used are shifted upward , the people find and assign them faster .
if you would rather like to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the S@@ ort button below the list .
if you have selected notes for each image individually , you might want to edit all the selected images and ann@@ ot@@ ate these images with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case simply click on the before and back buttons located below the thumb@@ nail of the picture on the upper right .
if you have recorded multiple images , e.g. with the same person , it can be more comfortable to mark all these images and use the menu item to add more entries at once with a comment .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the US . San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California .
in the picture you will see a browser window that shows the USA as an over @-@ group . to show you that it is an over@@ group , a special icon will be displayed .
in the context menu of the comment dialog it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition , you can simply drag an entry to a category and put it there to make it a sub@@ category of this entry . caution , this assumes that you just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically .
you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the buttons that form the top edge of the frame . you can also make a separate window from a frame by dra@@ gging it outside the window area .
if you have adjusted the appearance of the window to your needs , that you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options button ... , among other things , allows you to save the current setup and appearance of the window .
you can also completely fade out a frame . if you would like to see this window later on , use the Options button ... and then pop up a window . this will be seen in the picture .
if you select the image display in the browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected pictures , or all images in case you have not set a filter . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails , by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button . just try it .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set as a background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this will be shown in the picture viewer . if you have not opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the image preview . simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the Rem@@ ove button or select Del@@ ete Sel@@ ection in the Edit menu . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; you can use &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album for this problem . you can also use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album without saving you on your hard drive . of course you have to store the pictures somewhere , thus &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the picture you will see the view of &amp; k@@ photo album ; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard drive .
images in which the right upper corner is cut off are not stored on the hard drive . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 the thumb@@ nails are present , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album can show you the preview of these images . however , you can &apos;t view these pictures with the picture viewer .
as you can see this feature requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them again . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not support it until now you want to avoid inser@@ ting the respective CD . so if you want to avoid the confusion of your pictures , please buy a larger hard drive to save all images .
in the menu pictures you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that at the end those you want to make for others in@@ accessible and click &quot; Update View &quot; in the Privacy menu . alternatively , you can also select all the images that your little sister is allowed to see , and select the menu item All except current view .
this means you have defined which images should be hidden in the case of the case . if you now give your laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry images , whereby all the images you have locked are hidden . if you want to see the pictures again , click on the lock .
it is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply change the password in the Privacy menu .
please bear in mind that this photo protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , all images on the hard disk and on the other , anyone who can access the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only used to hin@@ der the view of private images .
the reason you spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is , of course , that you want to look at them some@@ time . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo album ; through an image _ and video viewer .
you can see the viewer in . it shows , of course , the picture , but additional all the information you have entered across the picture , such as who is in the picture , when and where has it been made , etc .
if the info box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and put it elsewhere . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether any information is displayed at all . all these options are available right @-@ clicking on the viewer .
some words in the info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click on this , the browser displays matching entries to this . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser displays all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you would have selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have downloaded several images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image up and down . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and End . these functions are also available from the context menu .
if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be checked by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus or minus .
a very useful feature of the viewer &apos;s &amp; k@@ photo album ; it is possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the entire space on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can zoom in and zoom into the image . you can simply zoom in a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the minus button you can zoom in again . the plus button zo@@ oms in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom angle is selected and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the key @-@ key , the zo@@ oms set , so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos that are in and out with the plus and minus key .
with the screen@@ shots from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current image using the menu item Not@@ ices from the context menu .
when you look at images it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the image . at the moment you can view this and open configuration dialog of the image to include this name . however , you may prefer to select only the image and view more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad as you view one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to provide images with features while you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . see a picture in which the features A , B and C are set .
once you have added features to your pictures , these are available in your browser . so if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have chosen , just add all of them at once . then you can use a module to copy the selected images onto a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in thumb@@ nail view . if you want to view categories in the preview view , you can add features to the images by simply selecting the characters for the feature after the image was selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you can use the photo album on the picture .
the batch is not saved with the image but in the database . in this way , you can rever@@ t your painting later .
in order to activate the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , select View on the image from the contex@@ tual menu . to finish painting simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er , you need to have the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not complete control , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you have absolutely read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wire model views .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the sub@@ object of an object already selected , since all objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and either click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the In@@ sert menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu is displayed to allow you to select the correct position :
del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button context menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click Apply to take these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message with a fault description will be displayed . then you can correct the input errors and click Apply or Sub@@ ject the Chan@@ ges with Canc@@ el .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view .
press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a sub@@ item element ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , tick locally .
the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and thereby change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the check@@ points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse inside the whole window .
each object has a Visi@@ bility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the point of view of the parent object or as absolute value . objects will only be displayed when selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility level of the scene selected in the toolbar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the default window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it as required . you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different configurations .
to anchor a window over or under a present view , drag the beginner to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then displays the new position .
to create a new column , drag the beginner to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to order several views on top of one another , drag the beginner right in the middle of another view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the flash@@ cards at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to solve a view from anch@@ oring , drag the starter to the desktop or click the small arrow pointing to the left in the bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the Ad@@ dress bar . to prevent the closing , click the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu you can find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any place .
the current window view can save you with View window order ... Save . a dialog appears where you can save the window order under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render it ren@@ ders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 current . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene , click on Ren@@ dering the Ren@@ dering icon in the toolbar or select the menu entry View scene render .
a render mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of render modes , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or select R@@ ender modes in the View Mode menu , the following dialog will be opened :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is a name that makes sense to recognize the properties of the mode .
in the size of the map you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the picture , select the check box sub@@ section and enter the image section to render into the input fields .
in the quality drop @-@ down sel@@ ector you can select the properties , the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection light . a detailed description of render properties can be found in the User Manual &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel , various errors can arise . these images often have a mo@@ ir@@ é pattern or stepped effect in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel in the picture . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , pictures with this feature look better .
if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calculate and connect &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tively because the super @-@ sampling refers to the neighboring pixels . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is fragmented and adapted again and again because the rec@@ ur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a beam per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then both pixels are processed by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4 extra points will be calculated , at a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the default threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are followed individually and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn on J@@ it@@ tering , changed &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection is calculated . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the corresponding beams have not hit the object .
opens a new window for displaying &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly terminated , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; file , select the Import menu item ... and select a file in the dialog box .
currently , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full command range of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if error messages or warnings appear when im@@ porting , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; import , write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ RA@@ w@@ Begin and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source text for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this inserts the source text of the object into the opened text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; and in your editor you can paste source text for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation for the displayed object . set the path to your document and the version here . supported versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example height @-@ field data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the scene folder , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file occurs in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used to display the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used to display the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window @-@ type registration plates .
you can set the object by@@ catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wi@@ re@@ model views . here you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation .
larger values result in a more precise wire model and therefore a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects like the sphere , you can set the detail level separately for two directions .
if you cross the high level of detail for extended projections , all wire model views are further sub@@ divided when the camera uses an extended projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions to the perspective and the vertical projections . this property results in a better approach for projections , but requires more time to render .
if you tick the wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a check@@ er@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you tick the bottom , a bottom is rendered below the objects . the floor is displayed in a check@@ er@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors .
if you check out edge smoo@@ thing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value .
on this page you can modify existing window orders or create new window orders . in the window directive section explains how to create and store windows orders .
drop down sel@@ ector Def@@ ault window arrangement : shows all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the list of existing windows orders shows all existing window orders . a new arrangement allows you to create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement using the Rem@@ ove button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views for the selected window order . you can create new views using the Add button and delete selected views with the Rem@@ ove button .
with New column , create a new column on the right hand side of the existing windows , with Un@@ ten you can fix the window under the existing window , with tab card you get a flash@@ card view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only receive a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules for rendering can be applied , as a result you will get a black picture .
if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you will only get a black picture .
if you have installed everything without error , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; the following default window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing toolbar icons . please read the documentation so you can get an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols frequently so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application .
in order to follow this guide you first have to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit Del@@ ete menu item . thus you have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera views the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the User Docum@@ entation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; see for it more details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location .
using the Apply button or the Enter key , the wi@@ re@@ model views and the object tree immediately change according to these settings . as a result , you can see the scene from the view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . for example , you might insert a header ( insert End@@ licher C@@ ad Qu@@ ader ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method of solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; actually offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
a good advice : select the layer in the object tree , change the name and then press the Apply button or the Enter key . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view now also displays the level , even if at the moment only a limited fin@@ ite level . when you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon .
you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will only see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and displacement . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene , you should move the soil to the horizontal line in order to get to know some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment select something simple .
in both cases a dialog opens , in which you can select how the object is to be inserted . the pigment will then be displayed in the property tree . you can change the name in the property view ( Name = bottom pigment ) , by clicking on the Pre@@ view button you will see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the preview of the pigment only shows a matte black material because you need to re @-@ enter settings for the pigment . therefore , always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on the preview .
if you don &apos;t see any color on the box and sphere in preview , just click on the Apply button and then click the Pre@@ view button .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you now render your picture with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color you expected . here are additional settings necessary . in the color list you have to enter two new attributes , called single color . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more often , but the board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , select single @-@ colour and change the colors in the object properties view :
you should be able to do this step by simply because you should have understood the basic method of working &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; already understood . the ball can be created just as easily as the ground :
in the view of the object properties , you can instantly change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget to press the input button or the Apply button ) , so the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground as you moved the ground around one unit down@@ wards .
of course rendering now gives a strange result : as seen before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . in the following step , set a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already with the floor , give the sphere a pigment as color :
select the first sub@@ object and change the name for example in sphere pigment . click sphere pigment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots and click Apply or press the Enter key .
the gloss effect and reflection sometimes result in good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ mium @-@ plated surfaces even if metal : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you and k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er have . hopefully , you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two dimensional image of a three dimensional scene or model .
when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the render shoots hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected and broken through the objects , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you view the scene . without a light source you can see nothing , the picture is just black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and a disk space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since last saved are dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have un@@ saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last rever@@ ted command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit .
save the current window order and open a dialog , in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , keyboard short@@ cut and the default behavior .
opens a dialog for modi@@ fying the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can use this option default short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up the toolbar . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er , using this option .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each bite on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical form of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both a dump @-@ map as well as for a texture map .
basic elements are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of this basic body . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel base by applying an image file as a color map .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser . the application has a file browser where you can select images for viewing .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Return key .
you can set whether each image should be displayed in your own window or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are searching for a specific file , just type the first character of the file name in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the bottom right corner . if a suitable file name has been found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialog Con@@ figuration - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; in the two other , short commands for the display window and short instructions for the browser , the short@@ cuts for each window can be specified .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color you can set further below . default is not full screen mode .
this point activates , loads &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still look at the current image . this reduces the delay when you select the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slideshow .
with this option , &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; at the end , the name of the last opened folder . at the next start &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; set up that only some of the file types that the program can display .
with this option , the display window is enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
determines whether the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows on the right of the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows on the right of the input field . default is 1 .
here &apos;s the short@@ cut for the different modes of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short instructions for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in one window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
shows small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
shows thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
reduced the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; will also be closed if no browser window is open anymore .
display the image in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
open the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ photo editing based on the digi@@ plug ; image editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of &amp; digi@@ plug ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a quick picture editing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform corrections and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is a show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user contributing his part to at least issues and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ photo ; makes it as easy as possible to report bugs or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu contains an entry reports you problems or requests . this shows a dialog with a link . if you use it , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . all required information is already filled in , and you can simply follow the instructions to give your message .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers help each other . if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ photo , then we would like to encourage you to answer questions to other users of &amp; show@@ photo ; however , in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
the best way to participate in a show@@ shot is to join the developer mailing list . instructions to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; .
&amp; show@@ photo ; tries to give you as much control over its work processes as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ photo ; to access these settings , you need to select the menu settings show@@ photo ; set up . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons on the left side .
in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator was selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display the colors with what you want to display . under@@ exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposure to a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side@@ bar on the right edge that provides you with important information and actions on the selected pictures . the same side@@ bar can also be found in image editing . you can view these by clicking on one of the five tabs :
&amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that no longer makes them scan and store images .
&amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that no longer do as images to scan and save . &amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for saving each image or save the images immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images before saving .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog for selecting the scanner will be opened .
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not handle these options particularly .
to scan an image , the user can start a preview scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
to better select the image the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also set the zoom in such a way that the complete preview will fit into the window .
when the image was selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if Before the Save a preview is selected in the settings selected , then the image will be displayed in a preview window as shown below . if saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and Sch@@ lie ? en will lead to a demo@@ lition and you will get back to the main window .
the button settings open the dialog of the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image , if desired , before saving . in this case , the option Before saving has to be displayed preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the type as &amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; Save images . open dialog for saving each image opens the dialog before each scanned image . if &amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; this will automatically save with a generated name in a pre @-@ defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking for a file name .
this setting defines where the images are stored at option Save without asking for a file name . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the dialog for saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... .
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the images to be saved automatically , and is also the suggested name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that is up each time a picture is saved . the # # # character string is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if the image quality is not selected , the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the Help button starts K@@ DE Help with the &amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button About launches the K@@ DE About dialog for &amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; the button Settings shows the dialog for settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; cann@@ ul@@ ite .
&amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; is licensed under the GP@@ L and the lib@@ ks@@ ane library used by &amp; cann@@ ul@@ ite ; used under L@@ GP@@ L . attention : lib@@ san@@ e is licensed under the GP@@ L with an exception .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses like all other programs ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes . below you will find a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . you can set up the global keyboard short@@ cut by right @-@ clicking in the player window and selecting Global key short@@ cuts . select the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; click with the right mouse button in the player window and specify short commands ... Select .
you can set up any existing multimedia keys in such a way that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Sh@@ ort@@ cuts . this makes your keyboard a &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe D@@ CO@@ P functions from collection , context browser , player , playlist , playlist browser and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports command line options from Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some of its own command @-@ line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing depen@@ dency . please check in your script whether all required modules are present and use c@@ dialog to make the user know why a script does not run .
begin require &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates directory , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand it with the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which each K@@ DE installation should be included .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow exec@@ uting external programs and commands . for this , the ex@@ ec ( ) function is usually used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this purpose , strings are written to the default script input . for this reason , scripts should continuously monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore events even if there is no use for it .
configure Wei@@ st the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok puts the work folder on the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change signals that a new piece is being played . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions , ask for more information about the new piece ( for example the metadata or the piece length ) .
the volume change new@@ Volume signal changes the volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ is@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub @-@ menu it@@ em@@ Dri@@ ll : contains the path to the selected files of the playlist , when a custom menu entry can be cli@@ cked . to remove an entry , you can use the D@@ CO@@ P function d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( Sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Album ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to perform e.g. cleaning up data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages which the user &amp; z@@ b has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , which can also be comp@@ acted with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , so that the user can clearly see the archive as a Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the mark@@ up amar@@ ca script . for this reason , you should correctly name your script packages .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file per@@ missions :
when your script package is finished , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and link to the Wi@@ ki script page by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps , you should use the Amar@@ ok category ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you just search for a very specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s Collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but can &apos;t decide which you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is exactly the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music based on certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . furthermore , many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose to listen to your music . these and many more useful features make Amar@@ ok the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right way to re @-@ experience your music !
usually , in the basic folder of the Amar@@ ok sources , you have to enter the following to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
since &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should not have any problems when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options to enable or disable the compile @-@ time point with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the compile options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met so that they can be used . for details , see the section system requirements .
activates Deb@@ ug@@ ging Symb@@ ols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with developing &amp; Amar@@ ok , you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without effort over the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the player window displays the player window in addition to the playlist . if the option is off , only the playlist window is displayed ( Ju@@ K ) .
use bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . the option switches the experimental function of the mood bar@@ ometer .
create atmospheric : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this will change the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer .
save voice files from music files : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files will be stored in the memory location of the respective music files . otherwise the .@@ mood files will be stored in the Settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok should be started when a browser is needed .
using other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser that is not in the list above .
save Play@@ list when you exit , save the current playlist automatically when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist while you finish .
relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , will be stored . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
to keep track of the current piece change , the playlist window will pop up / un@@ roll in order to always keep the running piece in the visible window area .
when changing parts to context @-@ browser , the context @-@ browser automatically changes as soon as the next piece is played .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can adjust the appearance and Amar@@ ok &apos;s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the fonts section you can set the use of various fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok . by selecting Custom fonts , the otherwise gray represented section is enabled . you can select fonts for the following area : playlist windows , Player Windows and Con@@ text Browser . click Select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the selection Custom color scheme you have the choice of choice and can set up your own color scheme . use the color sel@@ ector activated , including the color selection for foreground and background color .
re@@ play at the start causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after the program start , repeat the play automatically with the piece at the place with which it was stopped at the last exit .
set up the On @-@ Screen display allows you to turn on the O@@ SD . when using on @-@ screen display , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
you can use your own colors to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . clicking on the color spaces will open the dialog for color selection . if you do not use own colors , the default colors will be used .
the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ in@@ ama users , allowing you to specify which screen of a multiple monitor environment the O@@ SD is to appear .
the Audio Output tab lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers enable further settings in this tab card .
the collection card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folders and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes for setting how to proceed with the selected folders .
Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to browse both the selected and their sub@@ folders by music .
monitor changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folder on changes ( e.g. added or deleted music files ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; add all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will appear later in the playlist browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the drop down sel@@ ector driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setup in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window is necessary .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used to insert the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; on calcul@@ ator : will the host enter on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . afterwards , the network port under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data required for the connection to the database .
the debit card last@@ .@@ f@@ m set up the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations for the current piece as needed .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send played pieces and thus update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
get similar performers : after activating this setting , you can access the list in the context browser . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs so installed ( including the included programs , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) .
some functions , such as the O@@ SD , assume that your window manager keeps the relevant standards from fre@@ ed@@ es@@ k@@ top@@ .org . so Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will support for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t as these provide an excellent development environment .
you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and app@@ end the file that caused the crash . after that you can delete the file and let the collection be created again .
mostly this is because tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a little more mature .
make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when editing met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then disable automatically when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens at a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed .
this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 in the met@@ a @-@ info , but do not mark it as a Uni@@ code . the following per@@ l script resol@@ ves the problem .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repeat / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the icon effects are easily forgotten under Ap@@ pear@@ ance symbols . note that in some cases , you have to click on a symbol up to three times until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . you can see this with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf in such a way that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first .
most installation problems are resolved easily by the help of an expert on your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under er@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net on Channel # Amar@@ ok .
bu@@ g@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for searching for help . please only make a mistake there if something is related to fixing a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only an empty playlist appears . how do music pieces come inside ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
in order to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the Start Sub window has been converted to the Statistics window . you will find it under Extras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are for the evaluation by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
to rate pieces , the rating column must be displayed in the playlist . click the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; click on the title bar of the playlist and select column view rating . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select From Play@@ list Rem@@ ove from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse to the playlist and let them fall there , just as you would do with other files . that &apos;s as simple as : - )
in the toolbar of the playlist , right next to the Add button , the button Play@@ list is to be saved . click on it .
probably the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config is missing . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also check for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer can be found in the context menu ( right mouse button ) . you can also find it using the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no ! yes , this really is true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one of the back@@ end independent approach , so the actual question is : which media types does G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support almost every imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and P@@ NG !
it may ! perhaps use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which in default no MP3 deco@@ ders are provided ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input key
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s : - )
if you are using the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved using a sound card with hardware mixers ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you find the cause and solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to specify a different sink ( e.g. , sink ) .
you can &apos;t just send a MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would only hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also deco@@ ding the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can print directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound server with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
in K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia code@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this bug report . enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been heavily optimized for analy@@ zers ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you have to register all the components . follow the register to register all the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t work , you can also ask the IR@@ C Channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( finish Amar@@ ok beforehand ! ) : - Download as system administrator and once as your normal user . then delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer ( you will find the module folder with you @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
please report it under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. If you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . also , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm run this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command leaves &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before going to bed , then you will be awak@@ ened by the soft tones of music that you have stopped before going to bed .
how to get the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running titles when you are on another computer ?
if a working SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command will give you interpreter and title of the running piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ username Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and User@@ name with your User@@ name . this assumes that your identification is available in ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ windows . press the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will open in an independent , in the size variable window .
the combination of C@@ trl + right mouse button sets a piece in the click sequence into the queue . pressing the Enter key after a search in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search .
OK , the player window and playlist have tri@@ cky features , but what about the icon in the Control bar ?
click the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browser should be displayed .
my Personal Fol@@ der $ HO@@ ME is on a NFS drive . after the startup of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console .
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you have to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click Play Audio CD in the menu . for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic coding , instead , take files from folders mp3 or o@@ gg .

basically , this matches the previous valuation with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the piece was played . the more often the play was played , the less influence each individual rating has on the overall result .
you can enter the evaluation for a piece by clicking with the right mouse button on a column header in the playlist window . there you can change the rating of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by clicking with the right mouse button on the item and selecting Edit : select the rating or press F@@ 2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the Met@@ adata dialog .
the developers don &apos;t want you to tell you when you want to release a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a set publication plan that cannot be combined with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new function in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find ner@@ vi@@ g . de@@ activate the option icon while playing anim@@ ate in the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the toolbar . select Settings tool bar ... and set the desired changes there .
download a design , or create your own . then install it under Amar@@ ok ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance context @-@ browser design , click New Design ...
the icon was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties , it was removed .
Kon@@ quer@@ or &apos;s navigation pane allows you to monitor and control &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while browsing in Kon@@ quer@@ or . start Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to display the navigation pane . then click on the Settings button ( top ) and select Add Amar@@ ok from the drop down menu .
audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free user name and password . Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok .
if you want to use AL@@ SA then please check the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have caused a lot of crashes and therefore a lot of bug reports .
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you must re@@ configure and install Amar@@ ok .
now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ?
you probably need to install the package G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel . the same applies to x@@ ine , you must install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you need to re@@ compile and install it .
I get the error of G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix this ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you must compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .

I have a second sound@@ card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use Amar@@ ok to use the second sound@@ card ?
set up Am@@ ok Settings ... Audio output specify the device . typically , for example , h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with a on@@ board AC@@ 97 code@@ c and a USB audio device :
p@@ c@@ m.@@ int@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type plug @-@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm } h@@ w : 0 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 } h@@ w : 1 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
in the setup dialog of x@@ ine now insert us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of sample rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the check@@ box at the sound card supported m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio output with Arts won &apos;t be taken care of . you may naturally like to take this issue yourself into your hands ! if you want , you can become the new much @-@ needed suppor@@ ter for Arts : )
listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard that will be displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you don &apos;t like your collection later , or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , then this Quick Start Guide will help you . with your help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; set up in a few minutes .
creating a playlist is very easy . drag items from the collection browser to the playlist . the small text field for filtering the collection makes it easier for you to search for certain pieces . if you are happy with the playlist , you can save it by using the button Play@@ list . you will find this button in the toolbar of the playlist window .
if you have own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the folder of your collection , and you have enabled the option to import play@@ lists , you will find that play@@ lists are already in the tree view . by right @-@ clicking on a playlist , you will find various ways to load the playlist .
to play an audio CD , please select A@@ ctions Audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and CD pieces in WAV format . simply drag the wa@@ v files to the playlist and press the button to play .
the audio CD function uses the protocol Audi@@ oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . just right click on an entry and follow the burning menu . you have several options to burn a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . in addition , some additional packages are listed that make work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more pleasant .
if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player has also &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important features .
this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok are used , including creating a collection and playlist .
the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window is a running text display showing the currently running piece or the current stream . just below is the area , the game time , bit rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current piece . a click on this area changes the display of the already expi@@ red season to the remaining time of play .
in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the run@@ time display . you can switch by using the available analy@@ zer by clicking with the left mouse button on the area .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will be displayed in an independent , enlarged window .
the button PL activates or de@@ activates the playlist window while the E@@ Q button is used to set up equ@@ ali@@ zers .
the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the play @-@ posi@@ tional sli@@ der . use the sli@@ ders to adjust the play position or volume . with the playback buttons you can start / stop playing and switch to the next or previous piece .
using the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is easy and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own preferences .
to display the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you select the E@@ quali@@ zer check box , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation .
the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many functions that do not exist in any other player . but don &apos;t let the abundance of functions deter you , they are all easy to use .
the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , the navigation pane is on the left . in the navigation pane you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context browser . the playlist itself is easy to use , but even for advanced users Power@@ ful enough .
the context @-@ browser displays various information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context @-@ browser design . the context @-@ browser contains three sub @-@ windows : music , text and artist .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you might notice that the sub @-@ window has dropped off . the information displayed there has now been distributed to other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; furthermore , the information can be viewed in the statistics window ( Extras statistics ) .
the music below shows information about the currently running piece , as well as the artist and the album .
the first section in this sub @-@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to look up the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon you will find further information on the current piece . you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
to display cover images in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ ng are supported . the context browser will also display cover images , which are either downloaded with the cover management or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended plays . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
among the receptions there are the favourite pieces of this artist . this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current artist .
you can set which information is to be displayed in the music sub @-@ window . right @-@ click anywhere in the sub @-@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work out and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all pieces in the individual fields to start playing immediately . you can also click with the right mouse button on it and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites with the help of self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click the text sub @-@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is yet running , you can choose which should be started .
the Edit button allows you to edit the song text . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s Collection database . no running text script is needed .
the Search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - group@@ ed only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are ignored .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - First the pieces are arranged according to the artist and a further distribution is made after the respective album . if you want to see compositions or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view on your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list among different interpre@@ ters .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / year - Album - sorted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is used .
group@@ ing Album - All records of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically among each other . the artist will be ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - your pieces will be listed first by genre , including by artist .
group@@ ing genre / artist / album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album under the artist .
with the help of the remaining buttons you can adjust and combine the group@@ ing as you like .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically re @-@ record your collection as soon as you change something to the selected folder . if you own many pieces , this might take a while .
a search filter is located directly below the toolbar . it is the same in the list view as well as in the tree view . instructions for using this filter can be found in the section to the playlist in this manual .
under the search filter there is a selection field with which you can filter the recently added pieces to your collection . you can also select different time slots , from the last 24 hours to a year . furthermore , you can of course select your entire collection , whereby the filter is practically switched off .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser you will get the following options .
load - This cle@@ ars the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play .
app@@ end to playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you will reach the same effect .
set pieces in queue - This function will add the selected pieces to the queue . this will play you next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected songs as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
transfer to media player - add the pieces to the Media Player queue for transfer to the Media Player . see the Media Player browser section for more details .
all pieces of this artist burn / burn on CD - This will enable the selected pieces to be sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data CD or as an audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not be displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) Move files to the garbage bin ... - Op@@ ens a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
as a compilation , select the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears among different interpre@@ ters .
pick up a compilation @-@ mark - Change an album marked as a compilation , back to a normal album . after that the album will not be displayed under different interpre@@ ters but again under the associated interpreter .
the playlist browser makes it easy to handle many play@@ lists . among other things , it also contains smart play@@ lists .
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with pieces in your collection that have never been played .
even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click on Smart Play@@ list to open the dialog for creating a new smart playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the Media Player sub @-@ window is used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod sorted by artist in the top list view of the Media Player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired songs from the playlist and drop them on the list Interpre@@ t . if you &apos;re done , click Apply . this will upload the pieces to your iPod . if the transfer is finished , quit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and solve the drive integration for your iPod .
under the toolbar , there is a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden , which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can fetch music from a given URL . if you enter for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press Enter , you can access music in the file musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files can be difficult by simply dropping down . in this case , the holding of the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
you can change the order by simply drag the entries with the mouse to the desired place . once you enter alphabe@@ tic letters , only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed . in order to reset the filter , press the return key until the text box is empty again .
if you enter search terms separated by spaces , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all search terms . for example , if you enter a two three , the search will find all entries containing one , two and three .
for example , one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces containing one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) are found .
if you want to search for entries containing spaces , then en@@ close the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will look for entries that include Mike Old@@ field , but not for entries like Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a particular search column , you can also search for larger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50 . this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something searches for pieces that do not contain anything .
you can combine these syntax variations as you like . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this is looking for all pieces that either include Mike Old@@ field or a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bath .
you can set the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ trl key , and then right @-@ click on the entries . the entries will then be marked with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some of the functions of the playlist . on the left you will find the Add to which you can add the playlist items .
next , follow the Buttons back and restore , so you can rever@@ t or restore any changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the toolbar , there is a unique , larger analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the toolbar is menu . it opens the same menu as that which you can see in the player window using the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s configuration .
there are many more buttons available for the toolbar , for example playback controls and volume control . you can set up the buttons displayed by clicking on the menu and setting up toolbar buttons ... Select .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total play@@ time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval can be easily changed by clicking with the mouse twice in the corresponding display area .
you can also hide the status bar . to do so , disable the Status Bar option in the general settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking in the playlist on the menu . using this menu you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
a click on this entry will open the Visu@@ alization plug @-@ in window . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
behind this entry is a sub@@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start them by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover management includes a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the artist on the left .
with the View menu you can choose what to display in the cover management . choose from :
the queue management received your big move into &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this function you have even more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece in the queue , a number appears in the playlist next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on .
if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also easily add the pieces to the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre@@ defined ( the details to set up these later ) .
fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds further random items while playing .
add pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile for this dynamic playlist to work .
double @-@ click on the playlist you want , drag it to the playlist window , or click with the right mouse button , and then select Load . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new one . so , you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances !
the two pres@@ et modes Fe@@ atured mix and playlist mix will instantly fill your playlist and you can start playing directly . the featured items will start with an empty playlist and you will need to add at least one piece from your collection , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the latest playlist , then enable the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . in addition , dynamic mode can also be disabled via the same menu entry .
the New Ref@@ ur@@ ns the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . edit playlist opens the dialog for editing the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings .
right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist allows you to click Edit , and the dialog will open to edit the playlist settings .
enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the settings for coming pieces will be ski@@ pped and you will not hear twice in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the played pieces will be removed while listening to the settings .
played pieces - this is the number of played pieces that should be kept at the top of the playlist . thus , you can easily see which pieces have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you set more than 1 here , the playlist will continue to grow , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right side have already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog you can select from existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you tick multiple play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; random items from each of the selected play@@ lists can be added .
some scripts enable your own settings . you can adjust the settings by starting the script and then click on Set@@ ting up .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; scripts by clicking on the script . once you have installed the script , a new entry appears in the list . after you have installed the script , a new entry appears in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .
if you no longer want to use a script , you can delete it . select the script to delete and then click Un@@ install .
if you are looking for information about writing your own scripts , please refer to the Script Cont@@ ents section .

this Quick Start is intended to show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b in four steps . to understand the steps , you must have a run @-@ up installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog box where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 or other los@@ sy compressed formats then remember that when re @-@ encoding to MP3 , you will get poor quality no matter how high the bit rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created by a loss@@ less format .
in this dialog box you can do nothing . please wait until the computer has completed the burning process .
this Quick Start is intended to show you how to copy with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps . to understand the steps , you must have a run @-@ up installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have inserted the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
to copy a data CD , please choose Extras , CD copy ... from the menu . you now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning .
after you have made all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the Start button . you will now see a dialog that looks like this :
in this dialog box , you can follow the progress of the copy process . once the original image has been copied to the image file , you will be prompted for an empty CD media to burn the data .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you must wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .

c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . on the Internet , such programs are generally referred to as Ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional technology for audio encoding and for handling audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis profits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and encoder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 Decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . L@@ ame is used by the MP3 encoder module .
fla@@ c : a free open source code@@ c for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : other libraries for processing different audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg , for example , it is possible to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co

V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a fully equipped auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analy@@ sing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can be useful e.g. to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ attractive effect that the music pieces are reproduced differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to run from CD and automatically reproduce all the videos in the basic folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu includes a list of these projects . clicking on an entry will open the project .
save the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name .
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is displayed , with which you can select folders and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would like to view files for each project file .
closes the current project . if a project has been changed and not yet saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then choose between saving and making changes . you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open so .
includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project what to do with it , just as if you had called for each project file closing .
closes all opened projects and ends &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for each project not stored there will be asked what should be done , as if you called file closing .
when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you move the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD .
this dialog is basically the same as the project &apos;s properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button firing , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the medium . the burning dialog can only be opened if the project already contains data .
open the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them will be described via the What is the ? solution ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry will only appear with an active data CD / DVD or Video @-@ DVD @-@ Project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; files from a previous session to import the current project . this is useful if you want files for a multi @-@ session CD . it is intended for you rather than help so that you can see the files and folders already available on the medium .
this function only appears on an active data CD / DVD or Video @-@ DVD @-@ Project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project .
this also allows you to create an image from a CD , which you can then burn some@@ time later . furthermore , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
this also allows you to create a copy of a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can only create an image of a DVD which you can burn later at some point . furthermore , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . the converting / editing of a DVD with the help of the copy dialog is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to record all ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form .
opens the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
open the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD + R ( W ) , whereby the contents will be completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
burn a previously created CD image . the dialog will prompt you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then immediately be burned by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ o * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported yet , but you will need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog will prompt you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the button .
this dialog box will typically appear after reading a DVD in the table of contents , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the read , encoding settings and even possibilities for changing size and cutting black edges .
this information is displayed in the content view and contains the properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is enabled , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is enabled , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not enabled , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view contains an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is checked , their contents will be displayed in the contents view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with features such as media info , locking and unlock the drive or ej@@ ecting the medium .
the content view also allows selecting and dra@@ gging files to the project view . the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs if a drive is selected using a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
the header is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ line does not have any real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog box to change ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key signature for this further down .
this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup assistant . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs , so you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) at the start of the wizard .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work immediately . this dialog is intended for person@@ al@@ ising and fine adjustment of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many others &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can , for example , be controlled via a shell script .
in order to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program , or use the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and the type of tasks you assign is crucial .
in this chapter , we assume you use the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must first make sure &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then enter something like the following on the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ functions common to all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program , supported &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and other functions to generate new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD Project ( ) void copy@@ C@@ d ( ) void Bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void Bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void Bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project using the # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which can only be applied to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) void add@@ ur@@ l ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ String Transpar@@ ent ) void add@@ ur@@ l ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String sake ) void set@@ volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ string id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders , and then add files to the new folders :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ reader for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it , simply audio CD ; s can be read out and stored in MP3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on encoder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard disk ) and by many enco@@ ders that enco@@ ded these wa@@ v files ( these enco@@ ders need to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . more enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these wa@@ v files ( usually one per cap@@ tion ) comp@@ ress into the MP@@ 3- oder O@@ GG format or also in other formats like loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , the reading of the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now .
for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders have to be installed . all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is probably not necessary to compile something yourself . however , if FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required either .
which encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction about encoder , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to b@@ ypass any copy@@ righ@@ ted audio CD ; not even the mechanisms of copy protection .
while setting up only once ( the setup dialog can be called as often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , the daily handling for reading a &amp; CD ; on the hard disk explains . this leads ( hopefully ) to the understanding of the lean approach of the user interface that you will often stum@@ ble across at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which code programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; collect information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network , whereby everything is manually recorded .
this is just a short list of the commands of the main window . on the page step by step example are more information on how this program is used , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tabs for the configuration of the program .
starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data according to the setup of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the internet must first be established . )
starts reading and - if an encoder is configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup catalog - encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection can be read with another encoder than the default . it is to be noted that before the encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog .
opens the File Manager so that an existing file is selected for encoding instead of a full &amp; CD ; read out and code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , be@@ xes ) for program events ( such as read out the &amp; CD ; quit ) .
opens the main dialog from &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different card flash@@ cards ( like enco@@ ders , for setting the encoder ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , coding and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoder .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C , there are others like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psych@@ o @-@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but the differences are less important because both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still included with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions
+ high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) but slightly lower quality compared to O@@ GG at lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play@@ things is present .
MP3 - if music should also be listened to on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly support only the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems of high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . always needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate approx . 11 , 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and auto stereo systems . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you want to have absolutely top quality without regard to file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or fet@@ ched from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet is available in the program as a list of parameters . you can hand / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the encoding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD ; add title to keyword ( English : tag ) when encoding MP@@ 3@@ s with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameter from &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = but@@ ton@@ er in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read out the audio CDs that can download information instead of entering the computer . it is to be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translator : that &apos;s the author ) I am not attorney . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; information without the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be damaged . all information can be obtained anyway with a stroll through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b may be used with another ( fake ) address than the one in the system . in this kind of configuration , it appears that the email address is not used when invo@@ king the data from the server ( This can only know the programmer who has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , set up to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the hosts .
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which read program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more closely , search in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this has not yet been done .
for saving the read WAV files , the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected . the first opening contains pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( loss@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab to set up the encoder . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the encoder package must be installed by the respective Linux distribution before the encoder can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined enco@@ ders . more information on Ko@@ di@@ ers is found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a encoder , you can obtain more information about its switches by entering a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and read real on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia as well as the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) .
check if you do not want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check the cover of the &amp; CD ; this won &apos;t succeed !
there is a chapter with one step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understand everything , but are still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we &apos;ll use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords .
both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example with a search engine , since it is considered as non @-@ totally free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure the directory / usr / share / cd is and that you have write permission on it ( eg by trying to copy something inside the console ) .
the first section covers the basic set @-@ up of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something that is probably done only once and
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each reading &amp; CD .
here we determine the enco@@ ders to be used for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) and the resulting sound quality ( M@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program with the fre@@ ed@@ b to use the &amp; CD ; download data from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not change them on any output of a &amp; CD ; once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is passed to the reading program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device desig@@ nations for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the tab General Settings . here is not much to do . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is left as left / inserted as shown in the screen@@ shot .
select only for incomplete information , so that you will be informed if information on creating keywords ( tags ) is missing .
the CD ; Settings . simply select both entries . we are convenient and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b machine .
note : the computer must be connected to the fre@@ ed@@ b server while reading the &amp; CD ; it must be connected to the Internet .
the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found , immediately starts reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / file names or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory and file name will be changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or@@ - &gt; and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to enter all manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b is not used . however , this is more than 6@@ 20 MB big , consider this twice if this is worthwhile . to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card card .
CD@@ DB is a fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data the CD should be received ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b .
mode : we haven &apos;t downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB Server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server in your vicinity . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work equally as far as the server is concerned , as many fire@@ walls log the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , as the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example , we do not want to send &amp; CD ; data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . dis@@ abling the first check box should suff@@ ice .
just take the settings from the screen shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of simultaneously available pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one is at the same time with just one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author does not know , therefore simply try yourself .
CD ; disc@@ ard after reading the last piece : tick this to the &amp; CD ; disc@@ ard at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then the path / folder can be specified in which the WAV files are stored . this can be useful if there is only space on another drive . if the field is not enabled , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget to make this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself .
enter everything as it is on the screen shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something has to be fl@@ atten@@ ed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as already mentioned before , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for limiting the generation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags may also be deleted if necessary . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneously enco@@ ded wa@@ v files : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to code more than one WAV file at the same time .
this is it , we just have the basic set up of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; finished . this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; used . if you chose the organizational structure of your music clever@@ ly , you never need to change it again .
in this section we describe how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , was described in the previous section and set up . first , a connection to the internet is built up , since we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b is to be retri@@ eved . the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each read &amp; CD ; repeated .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a bit different from the data collected for a &amp; CD ; with successfully fet@@ ched data . therefore , you will learn to enter the &amp; CD ; data manually instead of retri@@ eving it from the internet . comments will point to the differences .
do not try the &amp; CD ; this example can be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this has not yet been done , the &amp; CD has to be inserted into the drive defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen then search in the Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers section after the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully fet@@ ched from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album are displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; a window is displayed and you can select the database entry that best fits your &amp; CD ; matches your opinion .
if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the Options dialog ) , you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the toolbar . if you have no local database , but fetch the data from the internet , you will need to connect to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - Input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the artist no longer has to be entered in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; input field unless you have a compilation of various artists for each piece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lower commentary box can be used for individual comments per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that are common to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you can not only be satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later at any time with the Tag Editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the help of the encoder to get more information .
simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the out@@ going CD ; in this example , this is not important since we don &apos;t provide the &amp; CD ; data anyway . for more information , go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org &apos;s website and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , return to the main window . just click on the line with the second one .
the CD editor window appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ; enter .
warning : this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the piece list .
note that there is a check mark before each line of a piece . only the titles that are so marked will be read out . a simple click on the line will turn on the selection of the piece . make sure that all pieces are selected , or press the All pieces at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once .
if you click on the button selection to start reading the selection process , this window will appear to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on .
click on the Ri@@ der orders to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the toolbar .
this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
you will see this error message when trying to work with a code that you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we entered here in the example . did you check if you have write access to the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . thus , read and code parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found any configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding . in performance @-@ weak machines , the result is unclear .
now the last title is read while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third job is in the queue of the encoder . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window with a message is displayed for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the code of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; today , you can download CVS as part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package . however , if you are familiar with CVS , you can download from there an anonymous copy . most distri@@ butions , however , already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , since &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator . install the k@@ de@@ multimedia package from your distribution . if you are reading this , you probably have already done it ...
this section is aimed at people compiled from source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running , then the following is correct for you :
a program that calls out many different programs has many variations of settings . it &apos;s best to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different tab card settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program without any indication of how to proceed from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it all about ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; let it do . at least after cont@@ acting with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and therefore agrees to this proposal .
strange if you managed to get the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke player of &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke live high@@ lighting of texts , he also has some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support . &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports the Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver that is needed for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the song text on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the track .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop to drag &amp; drop to drag &amp; drop any MIDI file from one &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Windows to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid will automatically determine the procedure used .
session Support . when you finish &amp; k@@ de ; when playing a song , k@@ mid will start again with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog , with which help you can select the song you want .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows into the &amp; k@@ not ; window . this also works with multiple songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the button Play in the toolbar , select the play sequences from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts when you draw it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( with multiple pieces they will be added to a collection and then played succ@@ essively . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and moving back and forth with the controller .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows to the left and right of the speed display and thus change the playing speed . to get back the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a play is played , a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the pause button or selecting the menu item Pause in the menu item , thus interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no play is played , start &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be saved in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text , others use lyrics and others do both . some pieces do not have a text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined which a song is used , so that you do not have to manually adjust the automatic text selection . however , if you select the Auto Tex@@ ts option in the Settings menu , you will still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to specify a type of event type , select the entries of text events or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has the 1 and 2 buttons .
a collection is a list of MIDI Files that you summari@@ ze . these are played back in series . in this section you will learn how to use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the menu collection under the item Organ@@ ize .... Click here on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . at the beginning , this collection will contain the same songs as the original ones .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the desired amount in the collection manager .
the temporary collection contains all the songs you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
when you leave the application , this collection is not stored . remember that when you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , you must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the Add button . it appears in turn the file dialog , with which help you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on the automatic addition to the collection .
when Automatic add to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Drag &amp; Drop ) .
if Automati@@ cally add to the collection is not checked , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the still opened items .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series from the sub@@ menu collection sequence of the menu collections , the songs will be played in the order as they have been added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to continue a song , select the Next song button , the next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right .
to jump back a song back , select the Previous Model button , the previous item from the menu item or press the arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter , since it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers which are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map transl@@ ates general @-@ MIDI events into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano type into events of the Change Her@@ patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type and thus always makes a trumpet sound if originally a piano should play .
if you have only one sound@@ card , you do not need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM equipment and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI maps , so you have to edit the appropriate file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all required transform@@ ations for playing a piece .
each section may appear only once except the Key@@ map section which may appear as often as desired . however , the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Name of Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Ano@@ ther Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ IF ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is used to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an email so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
in this section you specify how the patches of General MIDI are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the code sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to place all the sounds of this instrument to sound with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported for example ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) which sounds similar to a gun . to do this , enter the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP :
so if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that this refers to the term drum patch of the patch , where each sound is a different percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the always same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) .
the Key@@ map section is used to specify how sounds are displayed on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as is the presence . you must create 128 entries .
you can define several maps for each channel and each instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
first of all , the key@@ maps are used to make sounds on the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel . take a look as an example of the provided maps .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swap the first and second channel , just make it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards that have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need 16 or 9 channels ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel that is m@@ apped to the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the keyword is used with the name name for that channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch Option , all events that attempt to change the patch on this channel will be ignored . in this case patch x will always be used .
for example , For@@ ce@@ Patch can be useful to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates in which ratio pitch @-@ benefit events are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ benefit event with the value n , it is converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that no dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as are in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM pre@@ tends that a keyboard , which receives a pitch @-@ benefit event with the value 40@@ 96 , should play a tone higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards try to play two tones up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you &apos;ll have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog MIDI Settings . this can be found in the Settings menu , MIDI Settings
the channel view is a window with a complete range of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you can see which sounds are currently being played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button lights no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has two different views ( up to now ) to display the played sounds . in the Settings menu , select Settings at the Settings menu : settings
the speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so , for example , if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it . to change the tempo , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , etc . , so that the same MIDI file can result in very different results on two different devices , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
well , I can &apos;t force anybody to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; compiled without AW@@ E support . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I have no desire to add all files individually .
dis@@ agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ windows .
previously , enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the standard tempo you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop one &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or attached ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) , I just need to change to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows and drag the desired file to the window by &amp; k@@ mid .
if you just want to listen to a file , without adding them to a collection , turn off the automatic addition to the collection , and the new one ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so , set the setting Automatic add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly that one MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , it encourages me to write to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; I studied mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Mal@@ aga . at the moment I &apos;m in the third year , so I don &apos;t have much free time for my hob@@ bies , but I &apos;m trying to take a bit of time . as hob@@ bies I have programming , collecting MIDI files , making music and demonstrating phrases .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make me a joy when you send me a postcard from your place of residence or a MI@@ DI@@ - / Kar@@ aoke file from a local group . if you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file , please en@@ umer@@ ate ( if you want ) .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; written entirely in my spare time and won &apos;t get any money for it . I would like to point out that I only use it because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch at AW@@ E cards was too high .

a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , since the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use an FM radio device or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you must compile and compile with the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL parameter . it then runs as if you have a sound card , except that you can of course not hear any music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists or send an error message right to me .
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or Phon@@ on supported formats , as well as for playing DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished than &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine .
for additional help please check the site The K@@ DE website on new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user Ma@@ iling list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is returned .
it is possible to save the preferred connections under the book@@ mark menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category permanent playlist .
of course you can add groups to groups in order to obtain an additional hierarchy level . if you select an entry , his group and all his sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and the playback will start with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current play &apos; , TV and permanent play@@ lists can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course you can only do this if &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; not running . to do so , simply click on a name of a category , then select from the View menu and next edit mode . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part will be displayed .
after changing XML files , you have to select the same with playlist from the menu and select either the editing mode or select another category .
all changes are lost when the editing mode leaves or another group is selected without equal to the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player , some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation while starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c and changing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be inserted easily .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation while starting needs not to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . this would be annoying in the end animation but the user can therefore finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be the viewing of a favorite picture : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ current &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / etc ; &amp; lt ; / sw@@ il@@ lies ; In the directory test / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L are supported by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; supported .
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player configuration dialog ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the intermediate storage size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; in the toolbar of K@@ M@@ Player . here the output of mp@@ layer is visible .
there is no tab for this playback device in the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player configuration dialog ; everything needs to be configured by manually editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c , just like setting up the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how a flash is played with the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :

to ensure that a given back@@ end is always taken for a specific mim@@ e type ( of course only if this is also determined ) , this must be done by manually changing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c file . for example , Phon@@ on is supposed to play all o@@ gg files :

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is required to compile &amp; dump .
latex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to be applied to the package &amp; ly@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution should include the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; -@@ Project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages from &amp; Ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; web page .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users probably don &apos;t have to read this manual . however , all the suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , contact via the box ; web page should be established .
if you have any questions about or comp@@ iling &amp; Ki@@ le ; or if extensions are requested , this should be addressed to the Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net mailing list .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; latex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this easy , immediate and customized access to all &amp; latex ; furthermore , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wizard , the &amp; latex ; reference and powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; Po@@ sters ; and to experience its possibilities , the manual to K@@ ate should be used . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start working there directly by reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; kate .
for &amp; latex ; is the correct language : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , can also use a lay@@ man ( engl@@ . lay ) &amp; latex ; mac@@ ros . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while here only a good overview of latex ; given , it is not the ultimate book about it . in order to be able to master properly , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
the introduction contains at least the command \ \ document@@ class , the body begins with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ end { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ end { document } and must be closed again .
the Quick Start Wi@@ zard of &amp; Ki@@ le ; is an useful feature for fast creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; . the selection of the wizard ( menu ) offers some options for creating the document . you can also make some settings related to the document .
document classes : this describes the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , report &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ de@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) , film &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user defined .
encoding : this is used to set the character encoding . modern systems use U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . best of all should be U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X ( for the correct processing of the &amp; latex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used supplementary packages for &amp; latex ; they only have to be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . they should always be used when creating German texts .
new users don &apos;t have to worry about this . it is just a brief description of the functions and further information about this are given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - as well as other source text editors - high@@ lighting the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; if you see larger areas of a green text on the screen , it is with great probability that some mathematical environment is not closed .
when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) from &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically generates a blank line ( for entering the text ) and the corresponding line for closing the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be de@@ activated in the Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; latex ; allows sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most common and sub@@ category the lowest element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse .
when creating your own &amp; latex ; files can be very helpful if a DVI file is created . once a DVI file is created , jumps &amp; Ki@@ le ; by a click with the middle mouse button in DVI ; viewer to the appropriate line in &amp; latex ; source .
a DVI file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and other information such as the font and is next to PDF the standard output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing of DVI ; files for various systems and devices .
when using the DVI file , the elements of the DVI file are drawn with the editor and as soon as an element is cli@@ cked into the DVI file ; the default search is the exact opposite of it . as soon as on a section in the &amp; latex ; source text is cli@@ cked , the corresponding section is jump@@ ed into the DVI ; viewer .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , work with other embedded .@@ tex files will be simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set on project project settings .
quick @-@ construction : the &amp; latex ; source code is compiled and the result will be displayed automatically ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI file is fed to the outside and there is no call by &amp; Ok@@ ular ; after quick construction .
when viewing the edit toolbar , you should notice the three large selection fields . the selection boxes have been developed for quick insertion of joint elements into the document . the first selection field is for quick classification of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ...
the Other is for inser@@ ting items such as keywords , knot@@ s or references . the options available include :
name : with this command , a term for a section , an image or a different element is created .
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( choice of a selection field possible ) .
when using quote , a selection list will be shown with literary entries . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file is committed to a project . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; -@@ files can also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; by hand .
the last drop @-@ down box named Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã e is used for determining the size of the let@@ tering . it is possible to specify the let@@ tering for the main text , the joints , etc . the following characters are available :
when calling &amp; Ki@@ le , two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand .
the brackets after the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; defines the font . if the font is not specified at the beginning , this can also be done in the text .
as soon as the above source code example has been typ@@ ed , the &amp; latex needs to be compiled ; the easiest way to do this is to use the Men@@ us Construction or button fast construction .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; it automatically retri@@ eves the storage .
if the comp@@ iling of the document fails , it should be searched for errors in logging . when using quick construction , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be taken into account .
an environment ( environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font 12 is created and only a few places should have another font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } then allows the change of the let@@ tering in the surrounding area .
the changes are considered only within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no reduction ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to obtain the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fonts , li@@ pos@@ ure , ital@@ ics pressure , sub@@ titles , etc. can be added . these commands either end with the \ \ end command or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the ital@@ ics pressure and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in one sentence can be represented recur@@ sively with \ \ emp@@ h { word } itali@@ c .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { ratio } and ends with \ \ end { ratio } .
after the background to write the source text with the &amp; latex ; -@@ mark@@ up language is represented , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le is now followed .
as soon as a bit of text is entered in the wizard , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be made . for this , min@@ d. a quote , a few places in the bold and cur@@ sive print and a poem can be applied to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , it can be returned to the editor by an editor @-@ View or C@@ trl @-@ E ( in the internal viewer ) . an external viewer has to close its window .
once the DVI file has been created , the document can be printed out or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . just try and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format ( English D e V ice I n@@ RNA ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI file , the same steps as for the creation of the document are necessary ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed by file printing ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the toolbar permits the conversion of the DVI file into other formats . as soon as the DVI file was created from the &amp; latex ; source code was created , converting into desired other formats can begin using the buttons in the toolbar .
the submission search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; latex ; -@@ bin@@ dings . for this you just have to set up Modern under Settings box ... Tools can be selected .
in order to select the default search , the mouse cursor has to be positioned in a line of the source text and then click on default search . the jump to the appropriate place in DVI ; -@@ viewer is then inserted .
with this function in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; is opened with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; latex ; Document from &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; as text editor .
if there is no error in using the Quick @-@ construction of the &amp; DVI file , there may be an error . if there is an error , this will be shown in the log file or in the message window .
the log file inv@@ okes the source code error source . in the editor , the buttons Previous La@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ Ã ¤ t@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used between the errors . in order to view the faulty row , the error in the Log@@ ging must be cli@@ cked and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jumps to the defective line .
as soon as the corresponding button is cli@@ cked in the toolbar , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document . the default options are :
when selecting a blank document , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the wizard can be used to quickly create a new document .
ugly users of &amp; latex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be stored in &amp; Ki@@ le ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file must be opened or created a new file . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by using an existing document and selecting file template from document ...
when creating a new document from a template by file New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings box ... Settings can be set .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by entering the document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { article } .
the easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps must be executed :
when creating a new document , you can then select your own template instead of the default .
a template can be created from any &amp; latex ; files are created . if a simple way to create a template , it should be searched for on the Internet and the steps described below should be executed .
&amp; Po@@ sters ; uses &amp; kate ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the ability to read and produce from many different types of text files ( including &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; Po@@ sters ; can be made directly from &amp; Ki@@ le in the menu .
to learn more about &amp; posters ; and to experience its capabilities , the manual to K@@ ate should be used . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start working there directly by reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; kate .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; latex ; command reference , which can be inv@@ oked through the Men@@ Ã ¼ help La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be used in &amp; latex ; and its syntax .
double @-@ click with the C@@ trl key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that in this way , clicking on \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ big@@ skip is only \ \ par .
when dra@@ gging the text with the left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
using the arrow keys with a pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse the most different types of source code and highlight these . for example , the latex is different from normal text and mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color .
many assistants can add additional diving marks within the text . these are an own type of book@@ mark within the text . the menu items Edit jumping brands or the corresponding keys allow the leap to the next or last jump mark . thereby , this jump @-@ mark is also highlighted , so that at the first input of a character it is automatically deleted .
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; Ki@@ le ; although &amp; kate ; already excellent features , have been added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; latex ; source code always needs many environments and groups , and therefore supports &amp; Ki@@ le ; special commands for their selection .
he@@ als a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing an empty line on both sides ) . this added value does not include a text with continuous lines ( as in other text editors ) . this expanded meaning includes tables , &amp; latex ; commands and all other lines of the source code .
the word is selected from the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , since this command also contains &amp; latex ; commands with a rinse layer ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) will be selected at the end .
to delete a part of the document , it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; Po@@ sters ; offers the key C@@ trl ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers with its own commands for a faster option .
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is included in the description to edit select he@@ el .
it has already been made clear that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; for further orders under the working environment for a possible simple work with &amp; latex ; .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly before the command to open the environment .
this command moves to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment .
if the cursor is in front of or inside the \ \ begin { environment } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands , the overview can be quickly lost . this command then closes the recently opened environment so that the ne@@ sted surrounding structure is not destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also provides special commands for the &amp; latex ; groups that are determined by par@@ enth@@ eses { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to those from working environment .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket .
this command moves to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ling clasp .
if the cursor is in front of or behind the cur@@ ly clasp of a &amp; tex ; group # , jumps to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted bra@@ i@@ ded par@@ enth@@ eses , the overview can be quickly lost . this command then closes the recently opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups is not destroyed .
in &amp; latex ; two simple suits are used as g@@ asses . for the pur@@ pos@@ eful implementation is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign is used for two simple touch signs . also for termin@@ ating the appropri@@ ation , the sign is used . &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and performs two closing notes for &amp; latex ; one .
this automatic entry of the double request characters can be set up under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
you can also use foreign @-@ specific settings ( e.g. n@@ au@@ rus or French ) and there@@ with German or French quotes . there are also many other languages available .
when shifting from Shift ; Enter key &amp; Ki@@ le ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is located within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not just a line break , but at the same time the \ \ item command .
close the current line with \ \ \ \ with an end @-@ to @-@ end line break .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is smart enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; latex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be added under Settings Ki@@ le ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X to be added .
some users want to classi@@ fy the columns in spread@@ sheets and thereby all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; Ki@@ le ; tries to achieve this . although this tab is not possible , for &amp; Ki@@ le ; some intermediate space for the columns position of the current tab .
although &amp; kate ; already provides a good source code completion , this has been added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; to implement special commands ( mostly for &amp; latex ; ) . three of these modes work for automatic completion . all these modes can be set for different modes of work under Settings Ki@@ le ... quit .
at the beginning a new environment by the command \ \ begin { environment } becomes &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } to an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the back key , the last letter of the input is removed and possible , therefore , the complete list can be gr@@ asp@@ ed . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are naturally removed when selecting a command . alternatively , jump marks can be found , so that a simple jump to these positions can be possible using the jump brand N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ste jumping brand and the desired parameters can then be inserted .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; set up ... box ; complete settings can be made to these lists . there may be different wi@@ per lists for &amp; TEX ; - and &amp; latex ; commands as well as wi@@ pers of the general language used .
the command mode is not useful for the execution of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the call to full support mode will result in a large list of environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for complete destruction of environments .
when the Alt + Shift key Alt + Shift key Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically inserted and it appears \ \ begin . afterwards , the ambient temperature can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input key .
once this has been done , the environment will be closed automatically . once &amp; Ki@@ le ; realize that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be filed .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; set up ... box ; complete settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ liste des ver@@ quit mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; supports custom lists of cuts that are immediately replaced by a string of strings . the lists can be set up under Settings box ... boxes can be executed . for example , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word &apos; full@@ filled mode &apos; via the menu dialog , or the key C@@ trl + Alt spac@@ eb@@ ar , the character L will be replaced by the \ \ La@@ Te@@ X string .
large wat@@ chers are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been noted that many guards are written more than once in a document . thus , &amp; Ki@@ le ; the completion for all already written documents .
this mode can be set up in the Settings box ... box can be turned off . here , the threshold for the display of the completion can also be specified .
the exec@@ utable files can be installed in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Ki@@ le / complete / mode / the Per@@ s@@ Ã ¶ n@@ lichen Home folder . mode stands for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
the dialog box displays the settings of graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics about the graphics formats , the sections and attention should be taken into account .
PS files are not as known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders of pages . if the PDF output is used , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
to view the result of the work , the source code must be compiled . all the construction tools are group@@ ed in the Men@@ Ã ¼ s Cre@@ ating comp@@ iling , converting and creating view .
for comp@@ iling the source text for viewer like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used the keyboard short@@ cut Alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI file can be viewed in the standard viewer using Alt ; 3 , by Alt ; 4 the DVI file is converted into a PS file and by Alt ; 5 the PS file can be viewed .
when using the quick @-@ build command , a viewer is normally called after compilation . if no built @-@ in viewer is used , a new window will be opened each time .
a new project will be launched on the New Project project . the following information is qu@@ eri@@ ed for the project :
when exec@@ uting the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows for the execution of EC@@ MA@@ Script code . the scripts can be managed using scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet developed and can be changed in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first , it is necessary to say that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = box ) with the following methods :
&amp; latex ; is a fairly elaborate system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different aids to support the user .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; ly@@ live ; supplied with many documents . included are a documentation for the included packages and one more &amp; latex ; reference .
this is not only a description of all the programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a complete instruction for the and latex ; it is therefore ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents shipped with &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tra@@ l ; the finding of the correct document is not always easy . as possible help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / ly@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database of all documents and boxes ; delivered documents and there@@ for a graphical surface .
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is searching for package names or keywords . from &amp; Ki@@ le ; only the results are displayed .
double click with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is available for different architec@@ tures of &amp; Linux ; - and Unix @-@ similar systems . &amp; k@@ de ; is available for different architec@@ tures of &amp; Linux ; - and Unix @-@ similar systems . &amp; k@@ de ; is also part of the Fink project , which can be executed on &amp; Mac ; also on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X .
many thanks to those who asp@@ ire after the continuation of the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project and offer for many hours for the development of tools that we all can use in compliance with the &amp; GNU ; License .

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . with the command @-@ line interface you can create random signatures or daily signatures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides signatures for external email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signatures , any signature will be extracted from the signature file by &amp; k@@ sig . by many signatures with different quotes , styles and information , you can create your e @-@ mails more varied and unique .
for daily signatures , the same signature will be read from the signature file by &amp; k@@ sig for the whole day . for each day , use different signatures , as with random signatures , create unique emails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ trl ; N file New . this gives you an lt ; empty signature ; in the Sig@@ natur@@ es section . click the &amp; lt ; empty Sig@@ natur@@ es ; and add in the bottom section your new signature .
you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for email programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always enough signatures .
to delete a signature , select it first and then remove it from the File menu or click on the icon with the red cross Rem@@ ove in the toolbar .
open the dialog Sh@@ ort@@ cuts . here you can select short commands for menu entries . to change a short command , select an action from the list . then right @-@ click on the Custom Button and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the button or key combination .
for the use of &amp; k@@ mail ; is &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 required . to attach signatures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature text from the output of a command .
all call stack elements are listed here . the older the pile entry is , the lower its frame number . see the example below .

anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has known my@@ pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . let &apos;s take it another piece , let &apos;s give it a graphical interface ! no longer dependent on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked the icon for the XML processor and done !
this application expects a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is in the default work@@ folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the current work folder and enter the desired folder in the other folder field .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted every time you start my@@ pro@@ c .
as I said before , anyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for it .
if the opened file is inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book then simply let the current work folder be selected . if not , select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
if it comes to an output on the screen , its file is faulty . please check the reported bugs and try again .
if the file to be checked is already selected in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then the current file is simply cli@@ cked . if not , delete the file in the current file and select the file to be reviewed by another file - file selection .
if you only want to know if the file well @-@ shaped is , click the Well @-@ Form@@ ed review selection .
to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; which is specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; file selection . both for the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema as well as for the Relax@@ NG check is the specification of the Defini@@ tions UR@@ I ; in file selection .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; already selected , simply let current file be selected . if not , remove the current file and select the file to be processed by means of the other file selection .
enter the name of the file as the result should have named , the file is normally stored in its home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , which &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; invite , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . this makes the plug @-@ in system very powerful . you can immediately benefit from the additional functionality and don &apos;t have to wait until someone uses the device in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we start with the Edit menu . this opens the following dialog :
this dialog allows you to manage all included plug@@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug@@ ins without a location used &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project several persons in a sort of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and is used for unique identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can select from the list of team members who he is . this happens by searching the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identification ) appears to be bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and setting of your own identity are important with regard to news and notes . see for more information on comments .
in addition to an overview of the team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : an event can be created for information to the team leaders when something specific happens . see for further information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later can be seen how much someone worked on it or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that launches a file into CVS , as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the page Con@@ figuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub @-@ project manager . see how to set up such a ladder .
remarks are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
insert notes is simple . either the comment entry can be selected from the Editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword can be entered in a comment area followed by ann@@ ot@@ ation text .
comments can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the team member , role in the project consists of the following possibilities : team Leader Sub@@ project Manager Ac@@ cor@@ ding to the enrich@@ ment and sub @-@ project managers , the corresponding area or sub @-@ project names should be given as in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages , which is DT@@ D @-@ agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up using Settings Qu@@ anta ... This dialog covers some pages that are dealt one after the other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; with respect to tags including car completion , it can be changed . the entries are :
big / lo@@ wer@@ case of tags : big / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal size / lo@@ wer@@ case means the tags are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tag XML files .
big / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal size / lo@@ wer@@ case means the attributes are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tag XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if checked , it is inserted for tags , for which the closing day is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted .
not include optional tags : as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
update start and end tag automatically : if enabled , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters to the corresponding encoding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for the detection of different types of files . the default settings can be restored using the Standard button .
standard character encoding : the encoding of newly created files or in other ways than with file open opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) , but this setting will be ej@@ ected by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not detected . however , this setting is em@@ itted by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates regular backup copies , so that in case of a power failure or crash when the program is started , the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . also for un@@ saved documents , a backup is created regularly , according to the set time .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in your own view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , making it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
reset the window settings to the default when the next start is useful when the user interface has been changed by modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and do@@ cking / app@@ ending views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning message area is used for controlling the possibility to disable the display of warnings by checking out any longer .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the PL@@ - and the source @-@ view in shared mode .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the representation of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be adjusted in detail .
in the field of mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible , which can be changed by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse button .
in the structural @-@ tree settings area , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the update frequency of the tree when editing and how deep is to be opened automatically when changing the structure tree . empty no@@ des are empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document .
short@@ cuts are divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ oul short@@ cut means something different than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript .
here the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug@@ ins are part @-@ applications of third side , which can be re@@ used by any part @-@ capable application , the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin , if it is not at a stand@@ ar@@ der like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed to the plugin at the start , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; load component in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; read @-@ only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load . only read @-@ only parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the plugin : if this is enabled , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the entered information is correct . select to save the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting was completely new developed . support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was set , as well as support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept was implemented that allows different implement@@ ations via plug @-@ ins .
currently only one plugin is available , support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inserts .
using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger Plugin select field , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface :
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . normally appears in the left dock .
a view in which all stops , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view showing the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , all or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , is made , or it shares the plugin with to listen to Deb@@ ug@@ ger &apos;s demands . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , which uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally it does not have to pay attention to it .
the counterpart to de@@ bu@@ gging session Star@@ ts the session . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or stops listening to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server for a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is shown in the de@@ bu@@ gger output view .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and to send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , execution will continue . if the script is started , the script will start with the request .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without having to send information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , execution continues . if it happens before a request is made , execution starts as soon as a request is made .
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script without entering the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script , and if possible in functions and include , it is corrected .
instruc@@ ts de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the statement and go to the next as if there is no current one .
opens a dialog in which a variable or an expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
this dialog can be used to enter a variable or set a new value to a variable .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work of Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g that they can find on ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g.@@ s@@ f.@@ net with many more works of Keith .
this chapter describes how you can customize &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; adapt to your needs and how you can help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; help to get better .
document type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to give support for mark@@ up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; their simplicity and flexibility makes from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or &amp; CSS ; s &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consists of two parts , the tag directory and the tool@@ bars . tag files are handy , symbolic buttons of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , which insert text and instructions faster into a document than a user ever could .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on conversion .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and contents of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the tag . the file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool bars allow a quick insertion of tags in a document without the risk of a typ@@ ist .
tag files are nothing but folders . they contain only file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag files bear the name of the description language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the tag XML and declares whether it is necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only happen once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains as only element type about itself otherwise nothing .
the type of tag is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 only )
valid only for type method . specifies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 only )
if yes , the day has a common attribute group and attributes within that tag can be added to every other day . ( family 1 only )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
this element can only appear once for each attribute . it sets the name and type of the attribute . additionally , there are other tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element .
specifies the source code used for filling the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; will be used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , this means the name of the current tag .
a container day that groups the elements of a list . it can happen only once for an attribute description . it is a only element type element .
defines the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
specifies a list of elements which may appear within the tag to be defined . this element is a single element type .
specifies a list of elements that end a tag . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces affect nothing , but watch &amp; &amp; &amp; lt ; Notes . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause any break@@ age , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is to start up in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Windows to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to follow .
this function is currently not available yet . currently the check is done only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
in the following an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .

the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor to be edited via DT@@ D editing DT@@ D settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = turn 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with Settings A@@ ctions ... click New Action leads to the same dialog :
the key short@@ cut assigned to this action . by clicking the Custom Button a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ einer the current short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the defined settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not restricted ) that change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) can be started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even are the quick start dialog or the various See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first you have to specify the name of the script and the interpreter . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we replaced the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name is removed .
% p@@ id : is replaced with PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text will be added to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , from the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the methods above , a script can be input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in the input field input can be specified , which is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally only useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types output : normal output , written to the default output ; error messages that are to occur with the output written to the default output , by setting the value of the selection field output :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary for each group to create their own toolbar . in the given case , it is not too many , so you can create a toolbar with the name of the mark@@ up .
once a toolbar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode .
fill in all the required fields and add them to the appropriate tool bar .
complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you plan their use , enable dialog &quot; Edit Day &quot; if available so that entry is possible when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let us replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics Other Programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size other .
please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the day start , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually considered to be los , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least be sign@@ aled to a message to the user that clicking on this symbol will be inserted ; start@@ led ; -@@ tag is inserted in the current document .
after creating the symbol it has to be connected to the action . this is done via the menu with Settings A@@ ctions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . in addition to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the Apply button and continue with other tags , if there are any , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Fun@@ ctions to the toolbar or it should be shared for a better overview by some separ@@ ators into several groups . open the toolbar and set dialog using Settings tool bar . make sure that the required toolbar is selected .
after selecting the element that is to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the toolbar .
for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the toolbar .
please note how Tren@@ ner supports group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my toolbar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new toolbar must be tested by using all symbols to make sure everything works .
after New e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your toolbar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust its file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that its toolbar ( s ) will be loaded ( s ) when a file is opened by the appropriate type .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language that you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; repository if someone has already done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you have to look for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . we leave the first part to you , the second we will handle here .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ 2.@@ html tag 3 = tag 3.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation such a thing :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x.@@ html Get@@ ting Star@@ ted = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # of Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub @-@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of the box ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it for yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will be shown ! ) .
spaces affect nothing , but watch &amp; &amp; &amp; lt ; Notes . they should be replaced by &amp; amp ; &amp; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resources files will be replaced .
the content section is the range of do@@ cr@@ c file used to design context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; scripts , the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( just as you specified it in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation has been used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; community . you will not be rich , but be proud to have collabor@@ ated with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the failed resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or otherwise . at various locations , there is an Email @-@ Send menu item , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with e @-@ mail , tool bar toolbar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the script tree .
the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all the others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . the contributions are checked and only made available if our team needs them as correct and useful for publication . in order to make a proper contribution , the source of the resources is guaranteed , for both our team and for the future users .
when up@@ loading you are asked for their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private g@@ pg key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event you have several keys , you can choose one . in the dialog New Resources you have to fill in the input fields ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) from the toolbar , upload tool bar toolbar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the template and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , examines &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing . in case of problems it warns and it can then be abor@@ ted . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the resource of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML @-@ languages currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; however , the creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tag@@ XML format . there is the easiest way to automatically convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D loading and converting a DT@@ D . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description which should be used . afterwards the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type definition line : the string that appears in ! Doc@@ type Tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d
fine setting of D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand them and to get full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you must first famili@@ ari@@ ze yourself with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to explain exactly these concepts without understanding their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the work@@ space is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
global elements are available for everyone named &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from tool bars to actions , all that is marked as global is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this enables the group of administrators to secure different tool bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which then are available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific samples and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a particular project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply said , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ powers the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the tree views , the index tabs with information and the toolbar . please check in , and for more information about these areas .
you can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , like closing , rel@@ o@@ ading , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , jumping to a book@@ mark or exec@@ uting CVS commands to the current document .
right @-@ click in the Editor area leads to another context menu concerning the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , editing the tag under the mouse cursor , or opening the file , when the string is called a file under the mouse cursor .
at the top of the editor window are the tool bars of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as a standard for which a set of tool bars is shown . in the course of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool bars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements .
the use of toolbar buttons is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; insert in your document , then click on the icon that represents the tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( like anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the site views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow for information on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , open and strip them . in the presentation with file managers are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation .
project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as addition , removal , up@@ loading or dele@@ tion of files from the storage medium can be performed with the displayed context menu .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website , etc . all options are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates are available only for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . clicking with the left mouse button allows you to access the available information to a script . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can access the available information to a script .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is set in the document to the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element , a list of commands will open in relation to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree .
this tree appears among the other tree views . with it , many can change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the application system aligned to the content allows the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; Docum@@ entation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be added , edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two tabs at the bottom of the window that can be accessed using useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ scripts that are executed give all error messages ( if any ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; toolbar buttons are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command . the toolbar &apos;s chocolate side is the ability to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the toolbar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a tool bar in an email , you can backup and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and do not run here .
if you have problems starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that there is no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the PAT@@ H before its bin folder . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE interface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimised for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ? well , this would make him the most powerful web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML , then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
well , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; developer community is based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follow , in good application of free software , the idea of Why develop@@ e what someone else has already developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not only possible for users and developers , and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; thus to expand as they need it for their need .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ level@@ ed actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost any task possible .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .

a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes each time you open a file that is not on it , and the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . check the section on Tem@@ plates . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project folder , only one error is reported .
converts when inser@@ ting from clip@@ board there contained special characters to &amp; HTML ; description , so that they are displayed correctly and cannot be mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions .
converts the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; description which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily used to insert &amp; URL ; s inserted into the anchor tag .
enables selection of block selection . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script releases error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . that &apos;s the window where you can see the display of script actions and de@@ bu@@ gger .
switch off and turn on the problem repor@@ ter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem repor@@ ter will be activated as soon as you change to the structure tree .
shows the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries previous or next depending on the position of the cur@@ sors in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu group@@ ed by the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . that allows you to copy graphics files to your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
upload the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; whether you have downloaded further input / output modules ( K@@ IO Sla@@ ves ) .
settings , like &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; manages the project . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects you will find the details .
downloads a project tool bar . these are stored in project files / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu when you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your toolbar . allows you to select the type of toolbar : local or Project .
opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . this only creates the name . actions must be saved by setting actions ... Tool@@ bars will be stored on toolbar toolbar , or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar .
removes a toolbar from the viewing area . it doesn &apos;t delete it from the disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the toolbar , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team so that the toolbar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as app@@ endi@@ x .
allows you to upload tool bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in .
load a &amp; DT@@ D ; that made you or someone else and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
loading / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it is useful if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; be refres@@ hed without renew@@ ing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and does not exist in the global K@@ DE folder , the store fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbar . if the default ( HTML ; ) toolbar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu Standard in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar .
allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
activation or de@@ activates the intelligent insertion of tags . currently , this only works with ( x ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent joining means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; past@@ ing by tool bar if this day contradic@@ ts the rules at this place .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed under the menu items listed above . click on them . clicking on an activated plug@@ ins is de@@ activated .
sel@@ ects the syntax highlight mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the posters ; version .
sel@@ ects the type of line ending identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document by means of the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; by means of the external application ti@@ dy .
instant switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching may sometimes take time or create unpleasant graphics . recommended is the index card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub @-@ window mode corresponding to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub @-@ window . selecting an entry will activate the corresponding sub@@ window .
switches the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window on / off .
the changes in this dialog affect any application using the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
set the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; kate , you will find details .
a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the toolbar or which can add and modify the sequences .
this should generate a help according to the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom , since , for example , the whole directory structure for the rest of the project is automatically completed . all of these paths and author information fields can be set later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project properties .
here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is filled in automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment might be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates for the project are saved . it is a relative path to the project and standard templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and tool@@ bars by default . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . for server side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
let it be checked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included . if a project is started from scratch , do not hook .
with this option , all files and folders within the main folder are displayed and you can make an exact selection according to good man@@ ners .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the files you want by checking or , by removing the tick , clips out of the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded from the Project Properties menu in the sub@@ window profiles or Shift ; F@@ 7 can be changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholders possible ) , which are ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional options to top , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ or , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this allows you to select the de@@ bu@@ gger you want . currently , only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set using the Options button .
in the Pro@@ files sub @-@ window , high @-@ load profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by adjusting its own tree view for each profile .
in the team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can turn event actions and add , modify or delete these actions . event actions are executed when a pre @-@ defined event occurs , such as backing up a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened . this behavior can currently not be influenced .
to open another project , select Open Project ... from the Project Properties menu or the Project Open Project from the toolbar . the dialog project will open and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folder beha@@ ves as well , but the entries are missing opening and opening with ... in the right @-@ click context menu :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows removal of the current profile . if there is only one profile , the button is blin@@ ded to prevent removal .
the password will be kept in memory and forgotten at program@@ ing . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is needed and the rather uns@@ af@@ e password on the disk store option does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high @-@ load profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the name of the server to which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally this does not have to be changed unless the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port .
depending on your anxiety threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a risk . use it after your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it can not be read easily , but everyone with knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only one set of files and tool bars . there can be many views in a project , that is , a simple exchange of views can load various files and tool@@ bars and replace the recently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be saved in the Project or Project toolbar , accessible via Settings tool bar project toolbar , opened or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; which one has to do most . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to their own way of working .
as mentioned above , toolbar elements in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best stack@@ able from the toolbar . the use and addition differ . adding toolbar buttons is being treated at the bottom of the Add toolbar section .
the toolbar and the symbols on it can be set either by context menu ( right click on the toolbar ) , in which with New Action , a New toolbar can be created , other actions can be executed like toolbar , ren@@ ame tool bar , or toolbar buttons , indicating which actions should be visible on this or other toolbar .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a toolbar , the entries will also be removed and action processed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the toolbar and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings tool bar ... and settings can be set .
templates are basically a document skel@@ eton , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files for linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses templates basically like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move , or link any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions that are presented to the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions listed at the beginning of each template before use .
binary is all that is not pure text . it can be any file except text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary templates are usually included in documents using im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates .
documents can be of any text document type . on the basis of these templates new documents can be created . usually , more specialized documents are ne@@ sted in appropriate sub@@ folders . one makes a simple sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding for the purpose and organis@@ es work in an appropriate way to be efficient . some examples can be found in the template tree among global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
this kind of template is useful if not a new document is to be included in the documents based on a template but the same text area . you can find everything from a comment to a final grade to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl basis . some examples are found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for entire websites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
create a document structure as you like ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As template save As a local template ...
as soon as this is done , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File As template save selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can simply be dra@@ gged with drag and drop to the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used , such as drag and drop or paste over the Kon@@ quer@@ or file tree .
in the file tree or in the project files , you can click a folder on the right and select Site template , enter and secure a name for the template . by default , it is backed up in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates enable a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can pre@@ define he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynamically link with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them to them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things while using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates .
to specify the behaviour of a folder , right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection field with the three types previously described ; files , text or templates . this selection is blin@@ ded as soon as par@@ ental attributes are blocked .
this is enabled by default and fits for everything except the regular folders in the template view . if a root folder is configured so it would basically disable templates in this path unless they would be explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder .
allows pre@@ defined or reproduced text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows for copying contents templates to a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , using a context menu ( pointing right mouse button ) , you have a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source editor that can be accessed through the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second will divide the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it downloads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cursor appears . then , you can edit and switch back to the source code editor when necessary , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor on a document containing &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; to edit &amp; PHP ; to edit &amp; PHP , the source code editor is still required . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that at the same time the changes are visible both in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor , and the cursor in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is activated . pressing F@@ 9 activates the active cursor from one window to the other , while maintaining the position in the document .
the synchronization between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor can be set using Settings Qu@@ anta .... After selecting V@@ PL ; you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation : a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website so tools can choose document properties . this allows editing of invisible tags when working with the V@@ PL ; editor . this will also be called when a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is created . this is used to reduce the Hang@@ ar encoding . this allows you to change the following :
met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list allows to change the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword key 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way to design the viewing of pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list . a change over the list is exactly as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style sheet by pressing the file @-@ open button and selecting the appropriate file .
it is possible to use the cursor as in a word processor , by moving with the arrows . in rare circumstances , the cursor is peculiar . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typing and del@@ eting by button or removed button .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way across the toolbar , as in the source editor . it is to be noted that inser@@ ting tags earlier is not removed , e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded by text , must be removed any other anchor tag .
some tool bars such as the table assistant or the Listen directive are disabled . they will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists must be used tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the study of style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the design of the style sheet can be followed .
to be able to compile successfully , except &amp; k@@ de ; nor lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml libraries that are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already existing .
pause in a template , at one point in a style or x@@ ml file loaded by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , you can set the wai@@ ved stop points in a specific file and line number and be activated later .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the complete path from a file name without path input . file names in the same folder as the top@@ most loaded style template file with relative path to the con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g work folder . for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ otted .x@@ s@@ l is possible as follows :
in this command , a partial or complete match is checked with a pres@@ age called QNAP or a specified mode name . &amp; eg ; template agrees with any QNA@@ ME that contains the template template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNA@@ ME &quot; will be expanded according to the rules specified by the nam@@ esp@@ ace in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 becomes &amp; eg ; extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a sought after re@@ taining point must be resolved for the associated UR@@ I and line number . this will automatically be executed when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . stopping points will be re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each iter@@ ation .

on systems with an installed Re@@ ad@@ line library , you can scroll through the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes of the previously executed commands using the arrow keys .
multiple commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to hand compound expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; as an argument , a holding point is set in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &apos; .

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ not 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation in many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts when merging .
the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see exactly what had changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , any number of other useful functions have been added .
for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and insert it into one of the comparison windows .
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and merging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a fully @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
also 3 @-@ way merging is fully supported . this is useful when two persons work independently of each other in a piece of code and make changes . the merge editor under the differences windows allows resol@@ ving conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when merging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps when comparing and merging complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently need to check code , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , you can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left . ( no more trouble if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is equal , and the other differs in a line , the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different .
if all files have the same name , but are in different folders , you can make typing easier by using only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example :
ch@@ diff@@ 3 folder folder 1 folder 2 -@@ o target folder k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 3 folder 3 k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 -@@ o target folder
the Open dialog allows manual typing of file names , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the opening dialog displays your selection and shows it next time . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of differences with two files is performed .
by selecting a folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the matching or merging of folders is initiated . if a file is selected for A , but for B and C a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders .
if merging is enabled , the input field is active for target and can be edited . however , it is not strictly necessary to specify an output file immediately . you can also do this step later when saving .
the Setup dialog opens a dialog with Settings . here you can specify options before starting the merge / merging .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in open dialog you don &apos;t need to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button .
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , this would be a relatively big effort . you only need to create two corresponding files , upload them into &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you can extract nothing from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only dropping text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copy and paste ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text window is the Info line . the Info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and line number of the first visible line in the window . ( if the path to a file is too long , allow the mouse to rest for a while over the line . then a small auxiliary window will show the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these preferences can be changed via the Settings menu . )
when a difference is detected , you can see in the color which file differs . if both files differ , the default color for this is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( merging ) well .
when differences were found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white signs are not so important , it is useful to only see the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + e.g. white signs are only relevant in strings and comment@@ aries , for pre@@ processor and in few rare cases . )
the vertical line dividing the abstra@@ ction column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line breaks are activated , the line is dotted with broken lines .
the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an Info line with the output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Ge@@ Update &#93; if you have edited the result . usually , it contains text by automatic merging , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the S@@ prin@@ ge buttons to the next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , each difference is also a conflict that has to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group belonging to the row is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this will also highlight a jump in the position in the windows , where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black bar .
sometimes by automatic merging or manual editing , no more line is left in the group ; this is only a plac@@ eholder in the event that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source . this text does not appear in the final stored file , nor in a marker that you may copy and paste elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the clip@@ board when you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : if the sources ignore or ignore C / C + + comments when selecting the sources , changes in numbers or comments are treated as white characters .
navig@@ ating is mainly using the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , side up , side , beginning , end , C@@ trl @-@ start and C@@ trl @-@ end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs .
in the release window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the In@@ sert key , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the Sum@@ mary columns syn@@ cs the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merge section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the toolbar contains seven buttons to navigate to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ Down / C@@ trl @-@ above ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ Image Up@@ wards / C@@ trl @-@ above ) or to the next / previous un@@ solved conflict .
to copy the mark to the clip@@ board , press the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ In@@ sert ) . if this is enabled , whatever you mark is automatically copied to the clip@@ board and the manual copy is om@@ itted . however , be careful with this option because you could accidentally over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board .
line end@@ ings are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use a carriage return + new@@ line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not keep the line ends of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using binary files .
the options and the list of the most recently used files will be saved automatically at the end and restored at the next start . ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 set up ... )
choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , there will be differences in itali@@ c script . if the chosen font does not support this display , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered as ast@@ ert . on these systems , the Pre@@ ferences knob automatically displays an odd color .
if this option is checked , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab character is inserted .
if you press enter or return , the return of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line .
when this option is checked , each selection will be automatically copied to the clip@@ board . the manual copy to the clip@@ board is then om@@ itted .
you can select which line type you prefer to store . the default value is the generally usual selection on the used operating system .
when comparing files , try &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , to find all identical lines in source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . in this step white characters are ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a carriage return character &apos; \ &apos; r &apos; and a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others can only look identical in the page @-@ to @-@ side comparison although they are different . if this option is checked , wag@@ gon returns could be visible , however like a white sign . during merging , this option must be disabled .
in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are nevertheless displayed , but they are treated like white characters .
this option is disabled in default . changes in comments will be treated like changes in white characters .
the option is enabled in the default setting . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in automatic mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue .
this is useful when white marks are less important in many files . if you only need this from time to time , use the functions Select A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the Automatic selection also applies conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments .
these options are discussed in the chapter on scanning folders and performing a merge . see documentation for directory comparison and merge for details .
if a file is saved and an older version already exists , then the original version will be app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
adapt the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you will need to termin@@ ate and restart so that the change is active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available , because the language is set globally via the control centre . )
the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you enable this option , the top setting is used for all entries .
in the selection fields for coding a short note appears , which is the local coding . ( this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal character . )
customize the file encoding for source files . this will affect how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the encoding for each file is individually configur@@ able , even files with different encoding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding should be used for saving .
if you define pre@@ processing commands , they might not work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) This option allows you to set the encoding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands .
turn this off to supp@@ ress emphasis on changes in white characters in text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , you may only see the differences between two of three files . however , sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files .
sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen for long lines . just stop the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for viewing long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes consider the differences and then ab@@ rup@@ tly choose to merge the files . a simple click will run the merge and use the file name of the last source file as default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it will first hand it to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor which meets your requirements .
when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . if a standard pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this pre @-@ processing command . you can write your own pre@@ processor which meets your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient .
use this pre @-@ processing command for new@@ lines to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) \ \ \ \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is an erg@@ ular expression that matches any character in a line . \ \ 1 in the replacement string refers to the found text in upper@@ case .
the \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you might begin to understand it and maybe you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for a further default command for new@@ lines . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing , so quasi deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several sub@@ stitu@@ tions at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . for example :
instead of sed you can also use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replace / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever per@@ l requires only ( and \ \ ) , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the previous \ \ &apos; . example :
the data according to the normal pre@@ processor will be retained for displaying and merging . further operations only change the data that the line distance al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus looks like .
note : in rare cases when using a normal pre@@ processor , the line interc@@ essor displays the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often program@@ mers have to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively .
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ,
... can simulate the merge and display the simulated changes without actually performing it ,
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and merging single files . you only need to specify a folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
when three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder is specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically , not the merge . to start the merge , you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . )
while reading the folder , you will be informed about the current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folders , only the files that have been compared to that folder will be listed .
if the scan of the folders is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded up . you can open a folder by double @-@ clicking on the + / - click , or double @-@ click on the object , or by using the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions , fold up all sub@@ directories and open all sub@@ directories with which you can open or fold up all folders .
if you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison will be started and a comparison window will appear .
the icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders then it is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be automatically selected . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this kind .
as can be seen in the above picture , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns .
for identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered to be identical if their entire content is identical . then also folders have the same color . in folders age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green , then yellow becomes yellow and later when it is old , red becomes red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such fla@@ wed objects exist , merging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such fla@@ wed objects exist , merging cannot be started .
the mode to synchron@@ ize is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified and if the option synchron@@ izes directories is active . then sel@@ ects &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B do exist , but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; copied &amp; diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders are merged and the option New file instead of merging ( unsure ) is enabled , then an error message appears : files are different , but the same date appears , then an error message appears : files are identical , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange of such errors can not be started .
when merging , one file is executed after the other . it shows Fer@@ tig if the merge was successful , and other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right .
if in the setup dialog the file comparative method is selected full analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display additional columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or O@@ dner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start merging .
please note : if you do not have specified a destination folder , C will be used as the target in the Three @-@ Fol@@ der Mer@@ ge mode . B will be used as destination for two folder conver@@ sions , and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B will be used as target .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check whether all entries should be in the destination folder , also displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that might skip certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( key short@@ cut ) . to only merge the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid merging actions , a message appears that points to the faulty elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when merging all entries , a dialog box with the options will appear , Sim@@ ulate and Canc@@ el .
select Sim@@ ulate if you would like to see what would happen without actually making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( note the screen@@ shot ) .
when you &apos;re done with a file , select again start / continue directory merge or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved it yet , a corresponding dialog will appear . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work will continue with the next entry .
at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to avoid the cause of the problem . if you continue the merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , lets you choose another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before you proceed with the merge .
if some entries have been individually compiled , it will notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and will not merge them again at the later merge . even if the merge operation has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries are considered to be done . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . multiple patterns can be entered . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders do not have to match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignor@@ es files that would be ignored by CVS . many self @-@ format@@ ted files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder can be set with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ or file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a default attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a previous score sel@@ ects a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled by default .
when the option is turned on , symbolic links are compared . if the option is turned on , the files will be compared to which the links point . this is disabled in default .
when the option is turned on , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is turned on , the links will be treated as normal folders and checked recur@@ sively . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; does not check for possible recur@@ sions . ) This option is disabled in default .
the full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders over a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the modified date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is switched off by default .
similar to the date of change . there is no real comparison . the files are considered to be identical when they are equal in size . this can be useful , for example , when copying the modified date . please use caution . this option is de@@ activated by default .
activates the synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for merging are selected in such a way that both folders are identical . the results of merging files are also stored in both folders . this option is disabled in default .
if there are differences , instead of merging , it is suggested to copy the newer file as an action . ( this is considered in@@ secure because it assumes the knowledge that the other file has not been modified . ) This option is disabled in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version will be renamed and will receive the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , it will be deleted without further backup .
usually , the folder mer@@ ges view while merging single files is visible ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want that , you can switch the option directory &amp; text window to switch main windows in the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between directory &amp; text window .
you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge . to do so , you can merge a single file directly from the merge menu . as soon as you save the result , the status will be set to completion and the file will not be merged again if you start the folder merge .
however , this status is lost when you re @-@ read the directory : directory - menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transpar@@ ence with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders for opening that are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file to an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . you should consider a few things :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , spaces &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link shows a file or folder . then a file is always accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or modification dates . therefore , the per@@ missions or the modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently a difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP first always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the differences viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part , from the context menu .
normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is applied as a part , accepts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program starts to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select in the context menu Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when part is executed , it only supports comparing two files , a very small toolbar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in part mode .
there are already tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now it he@@ ats comp@@ are ) already . furthermore , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge like the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs very long and have learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all program@@ mers who have gone this way or are going to do it .
you compiled the program from the sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in the default configure installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical .
the editor notices for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source text and selecting the A / B / C button . however , this important information is lost when the result is simply saved as text file and it is too much effort to design extra a separate file format that could store this information .
the effort for this has so far been too big . you can always restore a particular version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly r@@ ased ; No sr@@ c wins ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does this mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and mis@@ ses the purpose . please use a different editor for that .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
for information on how to use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE , please visit the homepage .
for a list of recent changes , see ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ not 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source package .
to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; use the following command in the basic folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir sets the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you can find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should not have problems when comp@@ iling . however , if you encounter difficulties , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists of it .
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) copies to the clip@@ board and delete the selected text . insert ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift @-@ Pa@@ ste ) inserts the text from the clip@@ board to the current cursor position or replaces the current selection .
show only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , you need to re @-@ read the refresh folder after making changes to these options . )
this also means that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder when merging . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after merging . ( the behavior will probably change in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default .
note the buttons to select the source with the cap@@ tion A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be app@@ ended to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed when you click on the button .
in default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displays a mini preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the working surfaces , change their size , finish them or shift them . this works both within one desktop and several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a desktop and on other working surfaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked on the empty Back@@ ground of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu only has to set up the two entries P@@ ager ... and exit . if , however , click on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries Minim@@ ize , Maxim@@ ize , On Desktop and Finish . the commands do the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows can be moved inside the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work areas .
if this field is enabled , in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the names of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed .
tick this box lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is enabled along with name , the names will be provided with ord@@ inal numbers , &amp; eg ; 1 . desktop .
if this field is ti@@ cked , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displayed .
if this field is enabled , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed to enable their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the windows with their default icon and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . remark : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classic lets &amp; K@@ p@@ ager appear ; in a 2x@@ N grid , as from p@@ ager applications appear in some other window managers ; horizontal displays all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a vertical array , which is very well suited for presentation on the side of the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size that can display and move windows as icons or with their contents . in addition , it runs out of the control bar .
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set up sel@@ ector switch ... allows the dialog to appear .
at the moment this cannot be changed in the dialog . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vice . if you do not have any write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or turn to your system administrator .

this application is interesting for different users : artists , web designers and people with visual impairment are interesting . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag .
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended to include new functions . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance computers .
when you &amp; k@@ mag ; launch , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; shows the enlarged portion of the screen . in the following , this window is referred to as the magni@@ fication window .
the default setting increases &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse @-@ cursor as a mobile magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you can &amp; k@@ mag ; to do this , set a selected screen area in the magni@@ fication window ( sel@@ ector mode ) or the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the setting mouse poin@@ ter . please note , that &amp; k@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default node ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter .
in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fier window . this also works with the arrow keys .
in addition , if you press the &amp; Shift key or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the selection window .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window will remain fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved .
&amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy it to the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the picture and much more .
starts or stops the display . stopping the upgrade causes the needed CPU time to go against 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window will appear . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to save files , opening a new window , printing , rel@@ o@@ ading ( with the button document rel@@ o@@ ad in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , magni@@ fying and reduction &amp; etc ; .
k@@ mag is also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a screen lou@@ pe . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; to zoom in an area of the screen , as if you would like to use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visual impairment .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse cursor persi@@ sts for a while on the same spot . it is intended to help people who suffer from R@@ SI &apos;s syndrome ( repeti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury syndrome ) and that each mouse @-@ click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse cursor persi@@ sts for a while on the same spot . it is intended to help people who suffer from the repeti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and that each mouse click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without any pain . unfortunately , pain caused by the use of your computer may also be caused by a doctor if this has not yet been done .
to make it clear : even though &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse , and as with all ergonomic aids : the result can be different for everyone .
using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and clicks a mouse click once you stop the motion briefly .
the smart move is activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pause after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button . in this way , you can drag the dra@@ gging with pressed mouse button . the smart move requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this residence time must be spread after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click exec@@ utes .
if Intel@@ lig@@ ent is switched on , the shooting range is activated ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button wait before releasing the mouse button again if there is no moving of the mouse .
a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .@@ txt , but it can be changed later .
if the sound appears delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose Sound System and here the Ri@@ der General . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; started at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de ; available . at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program there automatically .
reset all settings to the values set when you open the dialog . if you already have pressed the Apply button , the settings will be reset to the status after the last press is pressed .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , the smart move should let you switch off first . if you are used to the automatic mouse click , you can later move the smart move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it might be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; for sounds .
first of all , you should be aware of which places a mouse click does not have any effect : clicking on the neutral parts of windows or in the browser window that does not provide a link leads to un@@ inten@@ tional reactions . therefore , you can park the mouse at such places until you want to use them again .
when your mouse clicks , you should clean your mouse , which is usually rather simple . the trick is that you don &apos;t just clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first of all , you need to remove the mouse ball . how this happens is different from mouse to mouse , but it should be clear when you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and dirt can easily scra@@ pe off with a flat blade or f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . if you are using the smart move in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be stopped by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use a different window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can carry out a mouse click yourself . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cursor to another location .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor to where you want to have it . however , park your mouse on a neutral zone of the desktop if you want to make a keyboard input . thus , accidental moving of mouse clicks can cause unwanted reactions . secure zones for the mouse @-@ cursor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the title lines of windows .
I try to work with the smart move , but I don &apos;t make it possible to edit text .
the smart move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very comfortable to select text to copy it to the clip@@ board and insert any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . however , you will probably only have problems . here are some advice :
do not use the smart move if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . instead , select a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key while you move the mouse cursor to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this time , every time &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is played , the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the moving time starts when the smart move is pushed . later , you can also use the smart move without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some exercise .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to be able to use , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X window must be installed , which should already be the case on most of the system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and these are correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; activates the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter wa@@ its briefly . this program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI &apos;s syndrome and which prepares the stu@@ dies@@ t pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to wait for a certain time to start a drag procedure before releasing the mouse button . in this way , drag and drop can also be performed with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program with which silent users can let their computer speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation history sentences that are to be discussed again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) , enter the command , which will be used later for the text output of text . for more details , see the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the standard text reference book . from the text passages you can often choose text passages without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screen@@ shot ) you determine the vocabulary for word completion . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . additionally , you can synchron@@ ize the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be included in the word completion .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a snapshot of the already spoken phrases ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
if you are running k@@ mouth , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is app@@ ended to the default memory . you can select phrases to be re @-@ spoken .
with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , speech output and settings , the word vocabulary and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the language output file , enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection field under the input field , set the character encoding using the text to the language generator .
mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on to the language generator as default .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following wild@@ cards :
of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation on your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
if this is successful , the further settings on this page will be ignored . if this is successful , the further settings on this page will be ignored . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ äm@@ on , der &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standardized interface for voice output , and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . choosing this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage you determine which action is triggered by the keyboard short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the Text passage text@@ book or in the bar for text passages .
with the selection of Instant Mess@@ ages , the selected text passage is directly spoken and additionally inserted into the course memory . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is initially entered only into the input field .
with the second drop down of the editing window for text passages , you can specify whether the text pass@@ book should be saved automatically when closing the edit window .
with the selection of text passages , the book is saved . if you select changes , the text pass@@ book will not be saved . select before saving , become &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text reference book is to be saved .
the Wor@@ ter@@ itory Page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for word completion . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection box , you can choose the currently used dictionary for word completion .
with the buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field and in the selection field .
select the desired language for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the words &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of each word is simply determined by counting the occurrence . additionally , you can compare the wor@@ d@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically inserts into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary through time .
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are displayed as tree structure .
in the lower part , you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage book , you can only change its name .
you can either add actions like new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books either by selecting in the menu bar , toolbar or a drop @-@ down menu .
you can change the order of text passages or text passages by dra@@ gging the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected portions of the default storage .
the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected portions of the default storage .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if the text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected pro@@ positions of the default memory .
if this menu entry is selected , a sliding toolbar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . the toolbar is by default on the editing pane directly below the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and dra@@ gging the toolbar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is ti@@ cked , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window displaying information about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is enabled , a sliding bar for text passages is displayed with entries . by default , the bar is located directly below the toolbar via the editing pane . by clicking on the c@@ unning left side and dra@@ gging the toolbar can be moved to another location .
you probably did not enter the command for the voice output correctly or not completely . open the settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the page General Settings and enter the command for the voice output on the file card voice output . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . )
Festival is a voice @-@ over@@ ing system at the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wal@@ is@@ isch are supported . the license allows us to use festival free of charge and without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . the command to voice output then reads :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator written in &amp; Java . currently , it only supports English pron@@ unciation . the license allows free use of Free@@ T@@ TS without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in / usr / local / fre@@ ts . the voice output is then possible with one of the three command examples :
for the third example , the option must be enabled by default input . ( this is the recommended example for the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ e@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA free of charge for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax would like to swallow the last character of the text , so an additional character must be added . therefore , the full command is more complex than in the following examples :
/ usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as default input must be on .
the voice @-@ over@@ s of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service that provides a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
since the adjustment of the language generator is done only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to be able to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
for setting use the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additional memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application with which people who cannot speak can be able to print text by the computer . a list of already spoken sentences is stored , which the user can re@@ spend again and again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth does not contain voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . a voice syn@@ thesizer has to be installed on the computer .
for more detailed user documentation , see help : / k@@ mouth ( enter either this URL into the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ats ; - the voice @-@ over@@ s system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service that allows any application to read text via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ats ; is a sub@@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program@@ mers are ready to be equipped with their applications with T@@ TS capabilities .
reading texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; Po@@ sters ; even if &amp; kate ; is embedded in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications .
speech output is used by the speech tool program , which uses various background programs such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc .
enables the creation of voice output on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; utility .
in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech mark@@ up languages like Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java , Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up Met@@ a Language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the &amp; k@@ de voice @-@ over@@ s ; an application without visible windows offering T@@ TS services via &amp; d@@ bus .
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and configuration of kt@@ ts@@ d over t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a web page or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor &amp; kate ; with which a text file can be read in whole or in part .
in addition to the bu@@ g@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) , you will find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ats ; in the k@@ de @-@ mail mailing list . you can also subscribe to the list via ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ passwords .
before you can use the program , you need to install program speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher and set it correctly . see also
on the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or so long as no speakers are set up , the card card is indicated . see also . if you have at least one speaker installed , the card card is displayed in general .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as various male or female ones , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up several variants for one syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up a speaker , before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , since the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher is otherwise used the standard speaker .
various speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are similar to several printer sp@@ ans for the same printer .
if you click on the Poster pioneer speaker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card card is displayed . this will also appear automatically when you start t@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up yet .
all already furnished speakers appear in this list . the preferred actors appear in the list above . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not present a speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a click of a mouse , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with a click of a mouse , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
with a click of a mouse , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to move the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click on one of these buttons to make your changes to the running &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
choose a voice type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girls voice to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the tab card . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can &amp; kt@@ ats ; almost use it . go back to the tab General and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so the T@@ TS service starts . see . now you can &amp; kt@@ ats ; use to read text jobs and manage . see .
if you have at least one speaker installed , you can start &amp; k@@ de language output system ; click the General tab to open this card . here you can set some general options .
this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card card orders will be displayed and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the marker , will stop K@@ TT@@ SD and disable the T@@ TS System from &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is terminated , run &amp; kt@@ ops ; continue , if the field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the control bar while reading it , it disappears once the read @-@ out is complete .
with the buttons in this row , you can start , cancel , pause and resume text orders .
with the buttons in this row , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board , or open a text file for reading . you can also change the speaker for an order .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all sides .
the job card orders will only be shown when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab and check for voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed page . first check , if &amp; kt@@ ats ; runs . then select the text to be read before , and select Text in the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should start .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; he@@ aders and other invisible marks are also read .
in &amp; Po@@ sters ; the advanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; first , you can read the text displayed . then check the text to be read before and select the text to read in the main menu . then the speech output should start .
this also works if &amp; kate ; is embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
Noti@@ fy is the &amp; k@@ de news system that noti@@ fies you of events that you have set up . you can also read the text of this news from &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different types of messages . for example , set up that you will be notified when a message appears in an IR@@ C channel where your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the IR@@ C news text .
support a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry appears in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application .
the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is part of the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ats ; is a good example . it removes tags b@@ r and b from the messages that K@@ Mail sends , and also the expression / local / in@@ box since it can be assumed in most cases as presum@@ ed .
filters are one of the advanced features of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
in Fil@@ ters , text is processed before it is sent to the speech tool program . they are useful to improve the pron@@ unciation , to replace spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker , or to avoid certain defici@@ encies of voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand how filters work , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech @-@ pat@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distinguishes four types of texts .
the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the retained jobs are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is reserved to important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text .
messages have the highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg , you can read a long text on a website , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also news .
the rest are simple text orders . any order that you initiate from the postcard order is a text order . K@@ sa@@ y@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are meant for the output of longer texts that have no particular ur@@ gency .
all four types of orders are executed in queu@@ es , with the exception of Screen Re@@ aders . when an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ops ; just one such reader reads , this output is hal@@ ted and finished .
first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filter the text and pass it on to the next filter . at present there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future , there may be further types of filters .
string replacement parts replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; will be delivered with pre@@ defined string replacement filters , which allow the creation of chat emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for reform@@ at@@ ting messages from &amp; convers@@ ational ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable way .
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML , from a format to another format .
with subscri@@ ber selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . for example , if you have a female voice on the Kart@@ ei@@ card spokes@@ man , you can read text of K@@ DE @-@ messages about it . read more .
each of these filters has adjustable rules according to which it is applied for a speech output . if the filter detects that its rules do not apply , it continues the text to the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Noti@@ fication at &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the bottom . the processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the normal filters installed . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are executed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the subsequent setup di@@ alogs will be shown below .
for the setup of string replacement filters , you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparative sample . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it only has to differ from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the Re@@ place column . the list is executed in the displayed sequence from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries are app@@ ended from the file to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter will only be used if the speaker speaks one of the languages recorded here . click on the button to see a list of the languages . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ trl ; key at the click of the mouse .
if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID running programs will get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ numbers you have to om@@ it . if for example , the application ID kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may just type copies .
the string replacement filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply to an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter . if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . the words must therefore be limited to both sides by separ@@ ators ( whit@@ esp@@ ace ) .
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . but if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the package k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls .
X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such transform@@ ations . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility has to be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the environment variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough .
with the Spe@@ aker selection filter you can send texts to a particular speaker , which is set up on the card card speaker , or to a speaker with certain characteristics . for example , you can specify that text by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ats ; passes a text to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker &apos;s characteristics which the program gives , and the characteristics of the speakers set up on the card card .
if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions , you can call it by clicking on the button to get help from entering .
to achieve faster processing , try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , that is , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
here you specify the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected , which meets the requirements most likely . click the button on the right to view the dialog language selection .
use these buttons to save or load your subscri@@ ber settings or delete all settings .
the Spe@@ aker selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply to an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with which program@@ mers can lend their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , which can be added to the K@@ TT@@ SD voice syn@@ thesizer , so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can use .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the voice output API of &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice output services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from program kt@@ ts@@ d about the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
text of the text for reading and an option is a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands , type :
open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; -@@ windows . just start kt@@ ts@@ d in one window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my speech ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ XML ; but when using the module for the festival , web pages are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able works at all . you must do that yourself if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and found via the environment variable PAT@@ H .
certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation characters seem to cause errors in syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only Kau@@ der@@ wel@@ sh is issued . what can I do about it ?
first , make sure that the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be remedi@@ ed by a string replacement filter . see .

&quot; speech Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ops , please contact the developer team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used to support SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; but it is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to compile &amp; kt@@ ops ; to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) , including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and development files for the speech tool program .
if you get the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code library for ch@@ ev@@ ets or have downloaded the tar@@ ball each night , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before you start using the speech syn@@ thesizer , first check whether the speech syn@@ thesizer works correctly with your voice syn@@ thesizer . you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf to do so .
&amp; kt@@ ats ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &apos; kt@@ ats &apos; , which uses the program speech discs . the kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr utility is to be developed in such a way that the set up of speech discs is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer required .
a long text is broken down into individual sentences . the user can go back to pro@@ posi@@ tional or paragraph mode , pause , pause or break the output .
for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose gender is female , it will be used , otherwise the best matching speaker will be automatically selected . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ats ; select a speaker , look in .
if you click Add a speaker to add a speaker to the list , or click Edit , the tab card display will be displayed . as an example , the setup of the modul@@ s for Festival Interactive will be shown below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in PAT@@ H , you just have to enter the festival .
select the character encoding for text passed to the festival . in the case of voices that are known &amp; kt@@ ats , this setting is done automatically . generally , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some controls and display them in gray , the selected voice does not allow these settings to be displayed .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded for several seconds due to their size . when you select this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( with greater memory consumption ) the first set will be syn@@ thes@@ ized faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you haven &apos;t set up a speaker ( or click Apply . ) .
if this check box is selected , the program window is shown at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after the start only the symbol t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr doesn &apos;t run yet , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to pause or otherwise control the reading .
here are all the jobs listed in the queue , along with the application that has commissioned the job , the current status of the job , the number of sentences and the currently edited sentence . the spokes@@ man ID corresponds to the column ID on the card card spokesperson .
with the buttons in this row , you can proceed or go back in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of multiple sentences ) .
with a click on OK , all changes to the settings ( also on the other index cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to see the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the Audio tab . see also .
text orders are listed and managed here . screen Re@@ aders , warnings and messages are not displayed . read more about &amp; kt@@ ts news types ; see in .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled or purchased without support for the corresponding audio module ; it cannot load the required libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
adjust the speech speed here . 50 . % corresponds to about half and 200@@ cent ; % roughly the double normal speaking speed . to enable these settings to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click Apply to take the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you will have to find out which device works with you . in case of doubt , select Def@@ ault .
on this map you can set up special actions that are executed whenever the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of speech records :
the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops them . after reading the output of the screen reader , the retained jobs are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next highest priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
messages have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that says messages . if you have just read a long text on a website , you can speak with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who just enters the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output is included in the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both the introduc@@ tory sound and the introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the incoming message .
the settings on this card are only valid for normal text orders . there are no special actions for messages , warnings and the expenses of Screen Re@@ a@@ vers if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to start with &amp; kt@@ ops ; Noti@@ fy your Noti@@ fy messages , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click Noti@@ fications . the card card noti@@ fications appear .
select this check box to enable &amp; k@@ de . if this setting is not checked , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications with which a sound is played are not read by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not pre@@ defined .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click on the Add button , a dialog appears in which you can select the application and event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message before , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; ma@@ iled when somebody men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message .
all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts .
use this drop @-@ down sel@@ ector to specify what &amp; kt@@ ats ; do when an event occurs . you have the following choices :
if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the text you want . you can use the following wild@@ cards :
you can enter the properties of the desired subscri@@ ber here . standard sel@@ ects the speaker that is shown as the top entry in the list on the card tab .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a certain event of a particular application , the action will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application .
the event All noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can set the default noti@@ fications as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications in a file . use the Load button to load saved settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except All Noti@@ fications will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for marking text for voice output . this standard contains trademarks for controlling voice , speech speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . also marks for controlling the pron@@ unciation of for example abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ops ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) as this is the standard voice that the festival uses in the edition of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog are not set to 100 % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ous .
&lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; &lt; ?

there are two types of filters - normal filters and pun@@ ctu@@ ation detection filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . this can start &amp; kt@@ ops ; faster with reading , since only the first set has to be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text order .
here you can see the set definition filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; as a default , a set @-@ level detection filter is set up automatically . you can change its settings or add more sentence recognis@@ ing filters , but beginners will get away from it .
the easiest way to learn the setup of the language selection is to check the language selection and enter text for reading . switch on the language selection , change some features and check how the selection of the speaker is changing .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; then can start faster with reading , since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
you can then stop or cancel text jobs on the card card , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal set limit identi@@ fier is set up automatically when you start t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing .
set definition filters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and insert a tab character ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) at the set limits ( tab@@ ul@@ ator characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the standard set limit identi@@ fier keeps the character set .
S@@ BD filters will never be applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( notify ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen re@@ a@@ vers .
if you have removed the normal set limit identi@@ fier from mistake , you can insert it again by loading the contained file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c .
the language selection menu can be used to over@@ ride the subscri@@ ber settings for the application .
use of the default speaker ( the top one on the card holder speaker ) . in other words : there are no speaker properties defined .

I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the Internet . I installed them and can use them at festival , but respect@@ ts@@ m@@ gr doesn &apos;t show this voice .
add the new voice to the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / appe@@ en@@ d / vo@@ iced int / vocals . if this is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; where you have found the voice , to the developer .
on the Audio tab of Audio there is a setting speed . for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and be discover@@ able via the environment variable PAT@@ H . some syn@@ thesizer modules such as Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed even on the flash@@ card for speaker setup . depending on the chosen voice , it is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speaking speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ops ; &amp; HTML ; read .

before you start using the syn@@ thesizer , first check whether your syn@@ thesizer works properly . follow the instructions that you have received with the syn@@ thesizer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported .
you must install at least one language . help can be found in the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read websites , you must install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on .
the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software in festival / li@@ b / vocals / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you must enter for the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is normally included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , look for the festival as the first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ syn@@ thesizer . then the festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; this produces the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete language output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates additional software to create this phone . Festival generated this by &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce from German lyrics di@@ phone . further information can be found under .
this procedure adds additional wra@@ pper code to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice synthesis voices . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folders but in the Fol@@ der Festival / li@@ b / .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; that allows managing network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ Center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a unified , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ Center .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings are displayed in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network Network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ; started .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to enable &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , to show the device at all and to set the network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and configured . if network devices are added later , drivers need to be loaded by adapting the following files according to the kernel version :
the network settings module will be loaded if the option is selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ index . when starting the module network settings , this will automatically detect the used platform on the system .
if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection will be offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which matches the distribution and release date best . by checking the non @-@ re @-@ questions the definition can be made permanently .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . before , all options are displayed grey , meaning the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in system management mode , click the button system management mode at the bottom right of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
the system management mode provides the full functionality of the module . it is divided into three tabs :
the network interfaces are used to manage network devices of the system . all available network devices are shown . the following tasks can be performed by the network interfaces :
the settings of selected network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options .
by selecting Automati@@ cally , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system are performed simultaneously with the start of the system services . the DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information at each system start , so no further setup is required . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP will be selected according to the system .
with the selection manual , the TCP / IP configuration can be done without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . the desired TCP / IP address must be specified in the input field IP address .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface at boot . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would result in a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off as required . switch on an out@@ dated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or turned off as required . switch off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
specifies the host &apos;s IP address in the local sub@@ net , which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with hosts in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located .
a host with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine calls ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS dis@@ solves this name in an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
entries can be added , removed or changed . entries can be added , removed or changed by selecting an entry and incre@@ ment or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons Hin@@ auf or Her@@ der in priority .
by clicking the Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog .
first , enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... There will be the Edit dialog .
the list of names , named by name , describes host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily at boot when no DNS server is available . in small , closed networks it can replace DNS server .
usually , the list of names containing names contains some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this still in @-@ test version of IP is to replace version 4 in future .
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... Add New Ali@@ as dialog will appear .
enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button . if the well @-@ known machine has multiple alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry from a named computer from the list and select Edit .... The dialog Modi@@ fied Calcul@@ ator will be displayed .
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the Network settings are not effective immediately in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command must be set in a &amp; Con@@ sole .
the home page of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
installing the pre@@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution can be used .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de does not suff@@ ice ; in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and other things .
this is recommended by experienced users only . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter important information about basic network technology is given , in the second all of them are discussed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; configur@@ able configuration files .
in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is conveyed .
IP networks are currently being operated using TCP / IP Version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 6 has never found a great deal of dis@@ semination . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . therefore , this description is currently focused on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is assign@@ able . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; the network administrator is the contact point to assign a valid IP address or , if available , DH@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address cannot be chosen arbitr@@ arily .
when setting up a small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , so their arbitrary use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are usually used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all the hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own machine ) . the default route is required for IP forwarding .
the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to its own lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
this part contains the configuration files that are affected by the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf file and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically changed with DSL connections so that it is not surprised if there is another content than specified in the case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is random@@ ly re@@ ass@@ or@@ ted by the scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ fig . a different stand than expected can therefore occur .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar that also provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for quick , selective un@@ packing .
before using a tape , it must be mounted by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can happen in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; download the tape backwards and read the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . detect &amp; k@@ dat ; don &apos;t know the pre@@ text on the tape , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape should be format@@ ted .
recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; the pron@@ o@@ ad , searches for the right index on your disk . if it cannot be found , you &apos;ll be asked if the band index is to be recre@@ ated .
if everything has gone smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched by fl@@ aps of the entry for the tape .
before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be resolved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; indicates by changing the symbol for the tape to recognize that the integration for the tape has been loos@@ ened and displays a corresponding message in the status bar .
before a tape of &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ;
a strap type must be format@@ ted before you can use to store data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; . if your tape drive requires format@@ ting before use , this must happen before you can format the tape from &amp; k@@ dat ; Flo@@ ppy tape drives usually require format@@ ting of the tape , whereas DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the band name and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; continue with the format of the tape . all data on the tape will be lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and ready for use .
before you initiate the backup process , you must select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local fil@@ esystem . only this file or folder will be backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile will be backed up .
mark files in the local file tree with a tick . only the so marked files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
ri@@ ght@@ click the local file tree and select Save in the Save ... menu .
once the backup has been started , the Con@@ figuration dialog opens . in this dialog you can once again check the selected files and change the backup settings .
once you have confirmed the settings , the backup will appear . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
ri@@ ght@@ click in one of the archives and select the menu item Test ....
once the test has been started , the dialog will display Settings for review . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for review .
if you have confirmed the review settings , the dialog appears to Vali@@ date . this dialog displays the progress of the audit procedure as well as the data throughput and the time remaining .
before you can initiate the restore , the files to be restored must be marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive entry . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
ri@@ ght@@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore in the menu ....
once the restore process has been started , the dialog will display Settings for Recovery . in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for recovery .
once you have confirmed the recovery settings , the dialog will re @-@ establish . this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining .
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re @-@ create the band index file using the band &apos;s contents . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can re @-@ create the index on two types of the tape :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected work folder .
for all folders listed under backup files , only the files in it are backed up that are located on the same file system as the folder . folders that are on other fil@@ es@@ ystems , you can enter separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independently of the others .
performing an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the kno@@ bs files &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can be set up using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ winding version of the tape device .
this setting is active , transm@@ its &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is mounted , the load will be loaded to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed .
if the option is turned on , tries to lock the ej@@ ection with the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is enabled , the release of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically ej@@ ected the tape . do not use this option with Flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is turned on , tries to change the hardware @-@ based block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you must tell the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; format@@ ted a tape , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should occupy only one memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The band id . the format of this string is machine name : seconds , whereby the host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the era in which the tape has been format@@ ted .
the Band @-@ ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / folder .
the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; tar . even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the content of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system logs . the program is intended for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users can provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the log files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system will store the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; hence , try to provide some advanced features to filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available to easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start tries and k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - will not be shown , and it will open instead of a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very likely not with system administrator privileges . the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the / var / log directory , for which normal users usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter by a selected criterion or after entered strings . in the default setting , the selection field will be displayed next to the filter . in the default setting , a protocol line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns .
you can , of course , select another entry . the string of the filter search term will then be selected only with entries in the corresponding column . for example , in the protocol file system log , select the column process , and in addition , enter the name of a process in the filter bar , so show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all log messages sent or created by this process .
this option is activated in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . note @-@ lines of level errors are indicated with a more con@@ spic@@ uous color than protocol lines of the level indication . the colored display of protocol lines can be switched off setup dialog .
if you want to display only certain processes ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this can , for example , be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can check the Add to New Lines option in the main window context menu to view all new add @-@ in lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows you to display multiple log files in separate sub @-@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub @-@ windows . once you have selected a sub @-@ window , select a protocol to display in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. There you will find more information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor rather known ( and named in the following ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the system V In@@ it quickly becomes the standard for the control of the program start when the system boots up in the &amp; Linux world . this is because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it .
I will not go into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I do not know about it : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might attempt to convert a machine to system V In@@ it without a re@@ installation and re@@ format . the &amp; Linux ; kernel first looks at / etc after an in@@ it file . therefore , you must make sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there , if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort , r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for every system service you want to start at boot up the system or when switching to another running level . system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is started only once . such calls are based on r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems do not have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also use r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run something with the serial port .
the kernel searches for in@@ it at different places after the program and starts the first one to find .
the standard run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . in the beginning range you should see a line like the following :
at this point , you can take a look into the second column and probably notice that the default Run@@ time 3 is . if you want to change this , then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab from hand and change the 3 . if you have confused it , then you come to repair it by re@@ bo@@ oting the system and doing the following :
but how does all the right scripts start ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no proper files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line as follows :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script will be inv@@ oked with the argument call . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the argument launch .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server running level that only lets ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; I could also have a user running level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you can learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
using &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is easy to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six running levels to launch it at this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ level@@ n or change the position within a level by removing it somewhere else . the entry is removed from its initial round level ( or its position ) . this only happens when they draw an entry from the area of available system services .
note : entries are moved when you move them to a new area . to simply copy them to a new Run@@ time , you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert it to the target range -- even if the same entry already exists in the target range of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again .
note : currently there is no way to restore records that have been thrown into the tr@@ ash . so be careful .
you can use the tab key to activate the different working areas ( Avail@@ able system services , Run@@ time 1 Start , Run@@ time 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to select a selection above or below the previous one .
to move an entry into another run @-@ level , move it with cro@@ pping into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and insert it into the desired Run@@ time with In@@ sert ( with C@@ trl ; V ) .
to manually change the sorting number or name of an entry , press the Enter key to open the Properties dialog . use the Tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are recovered from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ level , and now the machine is constantly running . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in the single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be ok ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; intended to run under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) , you will need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions but unfortunately does not comply with any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using another distribution : please check if all configuration files are available that are required by the system service ( and whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) just end without a message when their configuration files are not present or configured in@@ correctly .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; running level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the running level so that it can be added to this manual .
this documentation relates to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter Adap@@ tation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after making changes , you need to save it . either use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or the Save In the File menu .
the main window consists of two card cards , the user and the user group list . for editing , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog user and group properties .
some flash@@ cards are only shown if you have advanced system settings . only when you have enabled space restrictions ( quota ) for users , a flash@@ card is created on which you can make individual settings . more card flash@@ cards appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD Uni@@ xes .
the file password management card appears if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD UNIX .
this card only appears if the quota for at least one file system ( quota ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( identi@@ fiable by the file quot@@ i@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , whereby the space restrictions are respectively in KB :
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected using the file system with space limitation .
the Groups menu provides information about the group &apos;s group affili@@ ation . the default group to which the user belongs , can be found in the Pri@@ mary Group field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field .
the Group &apos;s dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the user or group menu or click the Add button on the toolbar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or the selected group works an@@ alog@@ ously .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add , remove and modify the boot password , add time to boot of the default operating system , add , remove , modify operating systems , remove , change and more .
