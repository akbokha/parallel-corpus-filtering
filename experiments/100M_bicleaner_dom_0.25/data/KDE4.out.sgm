<seg id="1">"" "the" "" "translate" "" "module can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras Website. select the source and target language of the translation from the drop-down list." ""</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated into place of the entire & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation is only very rudimentary. in the best case, babelfish produces a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations should not make important decisions without checking the translation beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated on the Babelfish page, where you can directly insert text to be translated.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; includes various modules for & konqueror; despite its small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of & konqueror; by making them more readily available.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information on the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the Manual to & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror, select Settings extensions... Open the Tools tab and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list with default settings from the box kde; addons. please note that there may be more modules on your system if you have installed additional software.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the package kdebase, the & konqueror; it contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click in & konqueror; on Tools crashes. then you can view the page that has caused & konqueror; to crash, or delete the list of crashes, if available.</seg>
<seg id="11">The view filter module (also called folder filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras address filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed page. as default, the display starts with the root nodes of the document, example: documentElements, all other nodes are sub-elements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides a more view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory on local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different tool- and text views to view the contents of your local filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & FSView; consists of plotting nested folder hierarchies using a so-called tree map. tree Maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">With & FSView; mirrors the size the size of a file or folder, with the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can be easily recognized even if it is far below in the folder hierarchy. consequently, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; -command you will be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; is an entry in the Treemap rendering a rectangle representing a file or folder in your file system. for simpler navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle that is switched to View Mode can either display depth for easy detection of the nesting depth or figure of another file property, such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labelled with the different properties of the respective file or folder. for each property you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordinate rectangle is to be used. furthermore, you can set the relative position of the caption in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">When performing algorithms for Treemaps, the rule should be observed that the area is proportionate to the size of the entry. in the Treemap in & FSView, this goal is not always maintained. it will be frames to indicate the nesting of entries, and this box will need space that will then lose the subordinate entries. note that less space is lost for the frame if the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">The distribution of the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. here it is always advantageous for labeling and to avoid space loss by frame, that rectangles are formed that are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are rows, columns or recursive divisions.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can set the minimally represented area for an entry via the menu entry View Attach on Area. instead, a space pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally it was & FSView; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widget, which was developed for the application KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The picture gallery module can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras image gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the Picture Gallery module, a dialog opens, which allows you to specify the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field.</seg>
<seg id="26">The images per line has a slider and a rotation field to set the number of thumbnails in each line in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">Use the check box to indicate the file name of the image and see if the file names are displayed in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="28">The check box file size of the image tells you if the file size is shown in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="29">With the image size check box, specify whether the size of the images is shown in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the dialog folder, specify where the gallery is saved and which subfolders are to be included.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Save in HTML file, specify where to save the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="32">Using the subfolder checkbox, you can adjust with a slider or a rotation field, up to which level the subfolders are included.</seg>
<seg id="33">Copy the original images with the check box to see if the original images are to be copied to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">Use the comment field to use a comment file for the caption of the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box Own colour depth, you can set a different color depth for the thumbnails than in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; Settings provides easy access to the general & HTML; settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; Settings can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras HTML settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">The media playback for the navigation pane can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Windows navigation pane or with the shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click in the & konqueror navigation area; and drag the music files you want to listen to in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Change browser detection adds a menu entry in the & konqueror; in addition to which you can change browser and operating system recognition for individual domains. this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The default browser recognition of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a web page that refuses to access this browser, change browser detection in one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the password in MSIE for pages that deny access with browsers on the basis of Mozilla. for example, you need the MSIE browser detection to connect to the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not correspond to the W3C standard or use your own & HTML; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identifier of this outdated browsers.</seg>
<seg id="44">With this option, the displayed browser detection is used for all pages of the website you are currently viewing.</seg>
<seg id="45">With the menu entry Add... you can set the extent of the information on the browser used and the operating system in the individual.</seg>
<seg id="46">With this & konqueror; module review your & CSS; style sheets and & HTML; documents in accordance with the recommendations of W3C and other standards.</seg>
<seg id="47">Check the module website in the & konqueror; check the menu under Extras Website. the following checks can be performed:</seg>
<seg id="48">With the & HTML; check out if your & HTML; document of the syntax of & HTML; matches any found bugs will be displayed. with this test you can make sure your pages are displayed correctly by all browsers.</seg>
<seg id="49">Allows you to review your & CSS; style sheets embedded in a & HTML; - or & XHTML; document. with valid & CSS, your web pages have a uniform appearance regardless of the browser used.</seg>
<seg id="50">Checks the links on your site to redirects and erroneous linkages. recursively all links on the website are checked.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here you place the addresses of the servers for checking your & HTML; -Documents and & CSS; -style sheets fixed.</seg>
<seg id="52">With the module web archive for & konqueror; you can save web pages with text and images in .html format.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "click on the" "" "Archive" "" "tab and a dialog appears to save the displayed website." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">The module Web archiving is Copyright & copy; 2001-2003 Andreas Schlapbach, Antonio Larossa and Malte Starostik schlpbch @ iam.unibe.ch larossa @ kde.org malte @ kde.org</seg>
<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface will be made available to you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly into & digiplug; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the gphoto2 library. of course, any medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digicam; work together.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digiplug; includes a fast image processing with basic image processing tools. you can use these to view, comment, review and correct your photos. the editing capabilities can be easily expanded with KDE Image Plugins Interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digiplug; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional capabilities. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion via libraw, DNG export and ICC colour management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; via the camera or the lens, which can be searched.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; Programs is also digitized; an open source project. that means it is dependent on the support of end users. therefore, you should report problems and opportunities for improvement.</seg>
<seg id="60">If you are using these links, your web browser will open a page in the error report system. if you use these links, your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system. all required information is entered here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digiplug; is a project supported by a community. that means that users and developers help each other. if you are a regular user of & digiplug, then we would like to encourage you to answer questions from other users. however, in this mailing list, however, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digiplug; homepage to learn news about released versions and other information about & digiBOs; to learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best way to get started is to register in the developer mailing list. instructions for registering in the developer mailing list of & digiBOs;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you start & digiplug; for the first time, you'll be asked where you want to save your pictures and database. you can enter a local, remote or removable folder. simply enter the path name or click the Folder icon Folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer, where the data is stored. this path stays the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you would like to add. & digiplug; will also be used as an alame library.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder that contains pictures, as base folders. & digicode; views each subfolder as an album. no image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="68">& digiplug; thirsts recursively the library path in its entire depth. you cannot exclude sub-folders unless it is iste in hidden folders. this lets you insert exhalbs & digiplug; do this by inserting a dot in front of the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as basic folder, you will notice that the albums in My albendirectory do not have any photos as symbols. you can change that by using any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can set up & digicam; set up your digital camera. after that you should learn how to use My Albums and My Keywords to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw File Support: if you are using the raw mode of your camera, it can be digitized; support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help Rohart Support menu.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh-DecoderSettings and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface will be made available to you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly into & digiplug; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the gphoto2 library. of course, any medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digicam; work together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transfer. the camera then appears as a disk drive. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may also use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digicam; uses the gPhoto2 program to communicate with digital camera. gPhoto2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transmissions via the serial port are slow, this connection is now obsolete. & digiplug; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support so that digiplug thumbnails can be read out reliably. if the Exif support is not available in libgphoto2, you might not be able to see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things to digiplug; is how easy it is to expand its functionality through modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digiBO;, KPhotoAlbum, Showigs and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in almost any way as a user can. their advantage is that it is much easier, & digicode; by writing a small module to complete a function when the changes in & digicode; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB; or change them to full screen with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Pulling and dropping images works everywhere: you can put an image in another part of the alumtree, above the horizontal dividing line or into another application window. the only limitation is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords, data list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields currently displayed in the symbol view. in this way, filtering on the filename only works if this is shown in the symbol view. which fields can be displayed in the dialog of the Alpe settings.</seg>
<seg id="85">The View & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos stored by & digiBOs are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard disk, after the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date on which the album was first created.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select Album Imporate pictures. you can also add a screenshot to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">In order to copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there. in the then appearing menu you will have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all the photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album features, right click on the album and edit the album features in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album collections: are a method of marking your albums so that you can group under a common name. the collection you have set will be used to sort your photos by selecting or sorting items from the collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do so in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: used when you sort your albums by date with View albums sort by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The Buttons Elder, Average, New Year: these set the date on that of the oldest, the newest picture or that of the average of the album. for this purpose it is first tried to calculate the average of images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">If you first have an album in & digiplug; open, the first picture in the album will be selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this should help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album icon, you have to click the picture with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu & quot; As an album preview, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can always be included only in a collection and collections can't be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digiplug; supports input of keywords for single photos in the section My keyword list at the bottom of the main window. album collections have a different effect. the collection always includes all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window will provide you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images in this album will be displayed in the picture window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magnifying buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album the first time, you need to wait short while the preview images are generated. you can avoid this in which you use All preview images in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information on each image is displayed below the corresponding preview. which information this is, you can edit the Edit menu; set up the albums page and adjust the preview images to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear. the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo. the screen shot at the top of the introduction to the main window shows such a help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all that is about & digiplug; works. albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you. image editing displays your photos and allows you to reach a number of improvements to this. you can reach all the functions that have been edited with & digiplug; you can choose between viewing the images, a slide show or the editing of the images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image processing with a photo by clicking either F4 Image Edit... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing.... in the Edit section, you will find a guide on how to edit your photos. with image editing, you can view and change your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">It may happen that & digiBOs; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the File menu. to do so, and how to adjust it to your needs, if your program is not listed, you will find information in the & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after processing other image editing programs, problems with the metadata included in the picture may occur. some programs do not store this data when you save the modified image. this information is lost from the EXIF and IPTC data such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digiplug; provides two options for rotation. the easiest is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select rotation. in the sub-menu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, right click on the preview and select F2 rename from the context menu. keep in mind that you will retain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you delete a photo & digiplug; delete it, it is moved into the garbage dump of & kde; moved. F8 Image Delete or Delete If you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">The View & quot; My Data License; organize your photos by means of the data. & digicode; uses either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of the last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be displayed in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the date page so that you will only be shown the photos of the selected days.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found again by selecting this keyword or searching.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Keywords can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords logically. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My keyword, so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG, so you can also use your keywords in other programs.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking on & quot; My keyword; or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword. if you add a new keyword after you clicked on an existing keyword, this keyword will be used for this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting deletion. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword is removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by pulling it to the desired position in the tree and put it there. then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword. a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting a keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My keyword; change.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album icon, you have to click the picture with the right mouse button and select Set as Album preview in the context menu. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">This can happen in two ways: once you select the photos you want to use with a keyword, you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My keyword; drag and drop them. alternatively, you can also click with the right mouse button on the thumbnails and select from the context menu keyword.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can add a photo with any number of tags. the photo is displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way you can give a keyword for each person in a photo, one for the place where the photo was made, one for the event where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keywords, this will be displayed in the main window under the preview of the image.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and select Remove from the keywords menu. the menu only shows the keywords assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The time beam view displays a time-dependent, adjustable histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved over this histogram. in order to select a time frame, you only have to click on the bottom rectangle of the selection frame, which indicates the time unit. this will display all the corresponding images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below you can enter a title and save your selection. this will then appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Includes all elements of the database: names, reviews, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, datestamps, and more.</seg>
<seg id="125">Neon er Search box is a small lamp that will be green when the search finds hits. if you click on this, the filtering will be deleted and all images will be displayed again. if the search has not found, then the lamp becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left sidebar with binoculars. if you open this you will get a simple search box like the one described above. however, you can save this search here as a live search, which will always filter what you have entered as a search criterion.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are satisfied with your selection, press the head OK and the search will be executed. the results will be displayed in the My Search list in the main window. if you want to change your selection after searching, you only need to select the corresponding entry from the My Search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">If you choose to edit search, the search form will appear again with the search information you entered. if you select an advanced search, the dialog for the advanced search will appear to change your previous search. more information can be found in the Advanced Search Tool section.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Search in the context menu Search.</seg>
<seg id="130">Advanced Search provides you with an advanced search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields of digiplug; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Albendatabase. all rules are displayed line-wise, separated by operators. an option can be associated with others about logical operations All..., One..., No... or At least...</seg>
<seg id="132">& digiplug; characterizes each image by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows images to compare by comparing these signatures. the smaller the difference between two picture signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area where you can drop every picture to find a similar. by means of a sighing, the result selection can be enlarged or reduced. if you push a picture from somewhere over the icon of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar, it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free-hand colour sketch: draw a quick sketch and & edited; find the matching pics. also here a threshold value can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble Mini program. you can zoom in or out using the mouse wheel. press Ctrl; left mouse button to move a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this requires, of course, that your images contain geo-data.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your geo filter, which is then added for a later use of the list below. it works like a live Geofolder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digiplug; provides an illuminated table in a separate window that you can easily compare pictures. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L To add the luminaire from the context menu. the selection will be added to the lighting table and its window will be opened.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview toolbar you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window. a small arrow indicates which copy is to be seen in which window area. if you select Preview from the toolbar and move the zoo or move operations on one of the images, you can compare the same area of the two images.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images. if you use pair-style navigating from the toolbar, then the two first pictures are automatically loaded into the fields. use the left mouse button on any thumbnail to see it in the right pane. this makes it easy to work through a series of similar pictures.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal delete actions work directly from the luminaire like e.g. F4 file editing....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right sidebar of the main window is available for both thumbnails in the light table. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">In the lower end of each area you will find a built-in panning function that you can see on the crossed arrows. to rotate the visible area of the image, you have to click on them and the & LMB. in the preview mode, both images will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zooming works just like in other views. just use the zoom knob under the images or Ctrl; scroll wheel to zoom into the image and out. this happens in both images if you are in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital inventory management - apart from the fashion word? digital inventory management considers every part of the process following after the image has been made up to final output and permanent storage. each of the photos receives, scans or digitally records a form of digital inventory management. most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips how to back up, find, protect, and use photos again. we consider downloading, renaming, removing, grouping, archiving, optimizing, waiting and exporting image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; digital inventory management adopts, indexed, categorized, secures, searches, transforms, confectioned and exports assets that have a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data on data. metadata is based on your definition of data that provides information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare say if you find more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you need to find no longer a certain photo without inventory management. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then do not use & digiplug;. the approach to save the metadata in both a database and in the image files guarantees very fast search and secure archiving which you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate anything into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you must decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc; make sure that you have to switch to a larger drive at some point.</seg>
<seg id="151">You might be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can quickly be found across your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place. if you make enough photos, then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; then export is a folder for images that you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements such as versioning of photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of images to different subjects and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% of archives and 5% work files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the batch processing easier. separate new ones from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and work files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know whether you are looking for an original or derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata option to be saved in & digiplug; this ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change which? to do so, digicam provides them with a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts, because you should assign keywords, labels and an evaluation to every photo. of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value. this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos while working.</seg>
<seg id="158">Now let's talk with keywords, keywords, as you frequently call other programs, or continue categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogued images from another source with embedded stitch, then digitized; automatically build the tree for you or place the images in the right place. sorting the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dragging a subtree to another. the modified key words are edited by & digiBOs; updated as the sub-trees are followed.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata is overlapping. this is a very rough representation, since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections. filenames and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to captions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to let anyone just see your photos, you want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies. you are sure to be interested in how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Take a look at this panorama. from far away is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look closer, start seeing some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I'll tell you this one of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! one starts to dream, have associations, memories, the historical period is again present, you may even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who view your photos, the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transmit the meaning to the observer to help him understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if an image is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digiplug; you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as lettering. you can even export it for a selection of images. if you export your pictures to web galleries, these labels will be exported to the caption and / or the title of the web gallery system. so you don't have to tell the story a second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system? wasn't it a boring planet before GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of spatial presentation now drives with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of using geolocation are countless and will become even deeper in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually rerun your travels with images with geographic information. & digicam; can also export kml files that you can open with GoogleEarth. you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the GoogleMaps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and denotes the practice to use copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information in the direction page of & digiBOs; as information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization can be used. this field does not support commas or semicolons as separators.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author's title (synonym for publisher line): linked to the author. this field contains the work name of the photographer. examples for this can be titles like: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for vendors): use the provider field to identify who works the photo. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer works for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here that you can see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they do not offer protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in the work with computers can delete or modify these, in the picture. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per picture. & digicam; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: record error, disk failure, electric shocks, ECC, transmission errors, ageing of the storage media, recovery, redundancy, Desaster prevention, lifetime, temperature, data size, spread aberg</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire. these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section it's about problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics which causes a loss of data.</seg>
<seg id="180">Of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archival-quality which last longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers about gold coated DVD, & Dollar; 2 the piece claiming a lifetime of 100 years.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can become unreadable, but you can reduce this risk where you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write a lot more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">75% of the data is only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and checksums. despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a favorable program called IsoBoster that apparently works wonders in CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux, but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks, hard drives, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical Media: Blu-ray Disks seem to win the format war against the HD DVD. a dual layer Blu-ray disk can store 50 GB and thus almost hexagonal the capacity of a Dual-layer DVD with 8,5 GB. all that was said about CDs and DVDs is of course also the Blu-ray disk.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recording device on high-quality media in a non-propriate format. afterwards, read the media with a description, date & author and store it on a clean, dark dry and protected spot. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Your manufacturer's warranties include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard drives on this topic: discort study</seg>
<seg id="187">The most common error reason for SMART is the most common error reason, SMART is not able to detect these errors. some of the errors detected by SMART indicate the imminent failure. these are especially reading errors and displacement meters. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you saved the files, but these losses can normally be recovered without great problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric appliances don't make a lot of electric shocks, it looks different in devices with computer chips and high speed processors. these can cause severe damage. on your computer these anomalies can cause lost keyboards, complete data loss, hardware aging, destroyed motherboard and other defects. so protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against current peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs a part of the energy heat and ends up the rest. it is normally available in the form of a plug-in bar. however, remember that not every connector also contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for overvoltage protection, you should ensure that it meets the UL 1449 standard, which guarantees a certain minimum of protection.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are also protected. some manufacturers also supply voltage contactors that also have a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially developed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection protects your system against minor fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you with a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds may lead to loss of irreplaceable data. therefore, it may be useful to invest in uninterrupted power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltages, these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power outage occurs. some models allow you to continue working until the current expires. if you purchase a UPS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with the cost of avoidance. a high-quality overvoltage protection can cost you up to & euro; 20 costs, A 500W UPS you can pay for less than & euro; 40.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can mount it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">You are in comparison to the hard drives at home however very expensive - 40 GB cost & Dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & Dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send the data about the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution for a local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are fed to photos. the professional version provides you more at your disposal, in the case of Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the viewpoint of data backup, the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and with large companies included in the offer a backup and a distributed memory. thus, they are safe.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer. all transfers are prone to transmission errors. the ZFS and btrfs file system ensures at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing about it is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when it happened in your hardware. all these disturbances remain undetected until you have no protection in your computer. no one seems to have ever thought of it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data route than the one in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, as they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. you will see thousands of mistakes per year already in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with record defects on a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon also be available for & Linux; and Windows.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started its own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. it is still alpha-status. it uses the same protection mechanisms used by the ZFS and is also available for & Linux; however, it is not yet part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss of the notebook and 46% in the workplace systems. in notebooks, the share of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to lower damage, e.g. theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; has been seen for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the most common file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process at a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not stored completely before the problem occured, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Digital cameras' sensors are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits. it is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixel cameras. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is rather worse. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. even DSLR cameras have a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard disk today for 100 & euro; so don't worry anyone else for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected every year from a data loss. so, back up your data to a plan and test this backup before you make any hazardous such as the reinstallation of your operating system, the replacement of disks or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backups on an external SATA drive every day. if, then one day, a flash will hit you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget plane crash: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore Desastergen prevention always means a non-local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above is a common reason for a data loss despite backup the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential lock: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot at two time points: the complete backup and the last differential lock.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. it generates several snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup has been made.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts rsync only copies the difference between files that have really been changed. this happens compressed and if you want to increase security over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Back up important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or any other optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure allows you enough time to detect and restore losses. at the same time, you will get a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. any further dilution should be done manually after you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, IPTC stored in the image file, retained XMP files, Keep Original, Memory, Scalability, Media, recover photos and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing devices,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable pictures survive the next 40 year that is approximately the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable due to your nature you have to look at all that is said today with caution and re-evaluate while time goes by. unfortunately, there is no other way than the current system backwards compatible. the less variations you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered on the basis of the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualisation is now available for everyone. so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures, keep it and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, storage and backup technology, or change your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist expression for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have set the scalability with you and have placed the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. with * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and store it onto a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new record was detected by the system, but do not hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdb # source is / dev / sdc # source; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of this if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open Source Standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no software that can read it, then you can create it yourself. this task will be easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">It is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can store gamma and chromaticity data for improved color assignment for heterogeneous platforms. the disadvantage is that it requires relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF and has a slow compression. this format we would like to recommend to you to save your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF is widely used as an image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a loss-free compression algorithm (Deflate). however, a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. therefore, there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative File Format is a royalty-free and open format format developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and required to use metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers are now available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML based XMP technology to replace the & quot; image resource block quot; technology of the 90s. it is a coding technology that allows users to embed their data into a file itself. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xml quot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers drag it in front of an original of your photo, mostly in raw format. XMP is capable of storing the metadata separately from the image file, but it can cause problems when linking the metadata file and the image file, and as mentioned above, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put it all together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include working on architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in DCMI communities and DCMI workgroups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images are on the camera edium, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save it to your raw archive. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a subtle editing, you can use external programs. if you edit the images again with & digiplug; edit, then you should add the metadata again, which may have been cut off by the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for copyright with a digital watermark. only export them in web galleries, code in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print them, etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digiplug; to get. in section adding a photo to an album you can add a description on how to add photos you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your Albendatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; to use, connect it to the computer, turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on. another description for this can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">If you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a ferential indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera are displayed. some cameras do not display thumbnails. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for each file, photos, movies, music etc. are shown on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The Metadata displays the internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer notices, GPS, etc. of the image. this information is the same as the metadata side bar from the main window of & digiplug; or image processing.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection of All. this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in & digiplug;. downloading the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all the photos, you can only select the desired by & kde standard selection methods; once you have selected the photos, use the Download button and then download Selected Selected. the Selected button will be download as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New downloadable is available. in this case, the new images have been selected with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, of course, only the new images will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you use the All Download or Selected buttons, a dialog appears where you can select the destination folder where the photos are stored. the list of existing albums is displayed, like normal folder. then, you can read the list of folders in the My Albums section. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you selected the target album, press OK, and & digiplug; download the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all by using the Delete All Delete button. if you want to delete only some, you have to select them first and then delete the selected delete.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no possibility to recover photos that you deleted from the camera. so you should carefully check if the photos were successfully downloaded into a & digiplug; -album before you want to delete them from the camera. if you want to delete the camera cher completely, you should do so via the camera's menu, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">The file names are usually used again after the photos have been deleted from the camera. this can lead to double file names if you upload photos from different recording locations to the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image was made into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for turning and mirroring the image and for datedresins. if you use this latter option, a folder will be created automatically per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer opens three more options that are executed before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two relate the data about the author in the section Standard Car Identity. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the Exif information into the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you want another date format than the standard format, you can use the prefix foto-% Y-%% d% H:% M:% S. turn on the date & time option. for more customizations, you should read the help of the strftime command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera file name, you have the possibility to change the file names in lower case letters when downloading. or in capital letters, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, which & digicode; used for a photo, is shown below the name that the camera provides in preview. your settings for renaming will be saved and used automatically when you next open the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digiplug; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera at the time of shooting to make an automatic rotation during the download. not all cameras provide this information. in the section sidebar Metadata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic turn is usually turned on, and if your camera doesn't provide this information, it lets & digiplug; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off automatic rotation, use the Advanced button and select the automatic turn in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date that the photo was made, it can be used to automatically create sub-albums on the target album. all images with the same date are uploaded to the same subalbum. not all cameras provide this information. in the Meta-data section, you can read which information your camera might have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually switched off, and in this case, & digiplug; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to switch this option. use the Advanced button and select the date-based lower at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the download button. then select Upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files you want to upload. you can also select more than one file with the default & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done & digitized; you where the pictures should be uploaded. select a folder selection dialog for the camera. select here the desired folder and press OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a generic term in this document. this refers to a position indicated in length and width graph and which can be displayed on a map. the data can be determined by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers, it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographic location. not everyone uses an airplane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this capability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser that shows the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digiplug; users who want to locate the location of the photo, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields such as direction, saddle and card references. there are at least three ways to achieve this. there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, about a post-processing of the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographic assignment (manual) and last about the manual entry of known sites.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that integrates a GPS unit. but there are a few that work with GPS receivers. either as card module or by transmitting data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you must save this data in gpx format as this is the only format supported by the geographic assignment module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract and correlate the data of images and the GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the latitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script which works with the ExifTool of Phil Harvey. it uses the signs hairy coordinates that are created e.g. by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show any European street maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, showing all navigation details for Europe.</seg>

<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written into the appropriate IPTC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">This field should be a photographer, freelance photographer, or an independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the author field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify the photo that the photo offers. this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here as they offer the picture to others & quot;.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the appropriate IPTC platform. this ensures that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the digiplug database; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be digitized without going lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Captions as embedded labels (JFIF) in JPEG images store: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the captions embedded in the images. this allows your captions to be read from other picture viewers.</seg>

<seg id="292">You can reset the default settings again by pressing the button Update to the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the brightness of & digiplug; can be set on this page to the default values. however, each time you open the luminaire, these settings are not available. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available. if you have one, you can get better picture results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing uses a black background behind the displayed pictures. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can turn off the toolbar if you use the image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the picture. these colors are specified here. in image processing, this View Mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">Chroma-Subsampling means that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for more information.</seg>
<seg id="297">Using PNG compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality, since PNG requires a lossless algorithm. the only effect is that the image data takes more time to expand and unpack. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option to compress TIFF files, you can turn the delate compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of TIFF images. it does not affect image quality, because the delate algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the setting of lossless JPEG 2000 files, you can save lossless. even if you select the lossy setting, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG. when this paragraph is written, metadata has not yet been supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In earlier versions of digiplug, image processing was only a picture viewer for photos. currently, it is quickly becoming a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard assumption is that all green pixels are equal. if the straight-line green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitively to ultraviolet light than the pixels in odd lines, this difference creates a lattice pattern in output. this option records the picture a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 lattice pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the Automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard it is a solid color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights. for other cameras, this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default is the top lights, so the parts of your pictures are burned out due to the inability of your camera to capture the top lights as a continuous white. use the setting colors to trigger some unusual results, since it shows the top lights in various shades of rose. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red. and drapw therefore try to reconstruct missing green and red portions from the still unsaturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">When you select the reconstructing option, you will get the possibility to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and can / should be individually adapted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably have to set it slightly higher than the standard 1. however, this can be done later in the image options of the digiplug; -picture editing. in order to keep the time for the demo invoicing, you should proceed conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the partial raw data that comes from the color-filtered image sensor that many cameras have and which makes a matrix of colored pixels available. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& Drapw provide you three alternatives: bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD interpolation. after some tests it looks like this. VNG interpolation (variable number of gradients) was the first algorithm used by Drapw. however, it creates color artefacts on the edges. bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with acceptable results.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses, you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a color softening correction, as it is performed during the shell conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions such as these should be given again. there are also LCMS and & digiBOs; information on how to translate the color information from a color space in the other, so that the colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when an image is opened in image processing / start color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile folder Set here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can save all your profiles. & digicam; will then examine these folders during startup.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles You have here the possibility & quot; default quality; for your profiles. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures color-administrated not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit the camera manufacturer and model you use. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which do not contain any color tonics mapping or gamma correction. currently, drapw Gamma is not corrected for conversions at 16 bit depth.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the Soft-Proof profile, which allows you to emulate how your picture would be returned from a device. this is very useful before you can print a picture as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated. this could be manually corrected, rather than relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it's pretty obvious which color profile is intended for. unfortunately not with the models from Canon. hence, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. of course, this answer is unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension leaves the style for the goal: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>

<seg id="338">Image editing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digiplug, so you may not be part of your distribution. for more information on the KIPI modules, see the section Image Processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window displaying the filename, current file number, enlarging factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently used functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of image editing change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before using File saving or the Save button from the toolbar. note that you can no longer recover the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">You might need to make a copy of your image before you change it. you can do so with File Saving as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by restoring or using the button The Restore the Image Processing button in the toolbar. you will then lose any change you have done in the photo since the last storage.</seg>
<seg id="344">Nearly every action of image editing can be undone or restored. the last action can be undone by selecting Edit Rec or Restore by selecting Restore from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, use the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z for undo and note Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; press the Return or Restore button in the toolbar for a moment, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu items, all actions in between will also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, picture high, picture or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can zoom in and out in the photo where you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: choose the magnification factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode. you come to the normal view in which you use the Esc key. if you do not want this, you can view this in the Edit menu & Edit. you can view it from & digiplug; main window. see the section for setting up image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can select the image in the File menu and get the Standard & kde; Print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual images or whole sentences. whole picture templates can be printet from your selection. you only have to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu Album Exportioning Print Assist. if you follow the wizard, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digiplug; main window has a sidebar on the right edge, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available without the navigation arrows, also in image processing. it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same tab allows the sidebar to appear or disappear to the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">The text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the captions are copied to the EXIF- and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are formed. if you want to use the IPTC label field in other applications, you should consider these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented it, use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image, the captions will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Next to the application button, there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this is always done when you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The evaluation section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars into the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written in the Urgency IPTC field. the code follows the schema in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used previously; -session applied keywords.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword is dynamically adapted to the entered search word. you can quickly restrict the number of options when searching for a keyword. this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering random keywords in a series of images. if you have entered different keywords, these are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set in the tree by checking the corresponding check boxes. all keywords of an image are stored in the IPTC-field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If you select multiple images in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not the entire selection, if you want to provide a selection with a keyword, please refer to the Keyword Keyword section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The Keyword Keyword Filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. usually, the left sidebar is used with their Album, - Date, keyword and search views. if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all generated keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop keywords. in the main view, suppose you have selected several images to provide you with keywords. if the keyword is already existing, you can simply drag it from the right sidebar and select it. then a dialog appears asking if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day. the keyword is on No keywords, which reduces the amount to three pictures. they were selected using Ctrl + a, and after that a keyword has been drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there. a dialog prompts whether this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at each start of the program. it can also be disabled on Settings Miscellaneous.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or two, you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry after which is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, key word, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator that is a name or string that is already in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can specify an Advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the group button. the options then look like this:</seg>

<seg id="377">The reason you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable variance of the actual photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that correspond to the colors you print or publish in the web to those from your digital dark room.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the topic comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at every point in the image processing workflows. in addition, you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions so that you can get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other picture issues are email or web where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life for everyone so easy, why should you use a different color space and thus have to worry about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all the colors we can see, the horseshoe region, and the colors in the sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindblooms excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to crash my monitor if I decided to work only in sRGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in sRGB colour space or not, you need to kallize your monitor, since sRGB causes your monitor to be recalibrated. if you are working as the color space of sRGB, you either need to calibrate your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve one image in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, synchronize, automatic balance and contrast extend from the menu Correction Automatic correction try automatically to make the best of your colors. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the luminance values over the entire image, so that the darkest point black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or out-washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">Comparisons: this method adjusts the luminous reactor of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible. it sometimes achieves very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only garbage. it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in an image or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic balancing: this method maximizes color range in the red, green and blue channel. it detects the dark and light boundary tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Adding Contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and a new adjustment of all values in between. this is only visible with balanced pictures and can be a good correction for poor photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digiBOs; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is a bit limited because of a color space with 8-bits per color. if you can do so far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can do the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by copyright by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it using the menu item Colors White Balance of Image Processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image. the preview will dynamically adjust the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance, click on the sub-window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel below this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right above, a histogram shows that dynamically changing as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels have very small luminance values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or the sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. shadow Alignment lets you improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the Preferences list. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will see the combined result in white balance. this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">"" "the" "" "Save As and Load" "" "buttons make this exactly. any setting of the white balance you set you can save to a text file and load them again later." ""</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences knob restores all filter values to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that neutral settings will also result in a different photo than your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image here. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high quality images. this coding also requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color tonics can be done by the sub-window for the brightness. a detailed guide for using color profiles can consult the chapter on color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">This tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously and allows you to save your settings so that you can use them for multiple photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always need the same error and therefore you will always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find in color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The digiplug; tool color effects provide you with four colour effects, a solar energy effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation was also known as Sabatier, an effect that was created when a partially developed pressure replaced a short flash light. the colored, darker areas protected the delicate photo paper from the additional light. this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second lighting. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the polarization. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. a further upliftment finally generates a negative picture so that it cannot be produced on photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar energy effect. the original image is the (1) and that edits the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. just try it, it beautifies many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is a composition of & quot; Velvet Media aquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make it a film of choice for wildlife photographers. Velvias strongly saturated colors are too much for some photographers, especially those who have hardly any landscapes.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repetitions the strength of the neon light.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and luminosity of the photos. you can experiment to look at the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors. once you are satisfied with the result use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor light conditions, you can get the reverse problem: a too big saturation. even in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation instead of increasing it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex mold gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the tool toner correction is located to improve the exposure. even if the dialogue to this tool works very complicated, you only need the area of slider for the use purpose described here.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected range. below the graph three sliders are clicked into which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to move the controller and make sure that the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right, the original and the preview of the image can be viewed. the preview will be dynamic, based on the settings of the image. the following options are available on the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box it can be set whether the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic y axis. for images of a digital camera the linear histogram is often dominated by a single column. in this case the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knobs: the upper one for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pinpettes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the entries of shadows, medium and bright tones. in addition, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values interactively as with the input values. for example, the compression of the output values can be used to create a light image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatic: with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the set values can be saved in the filesystem and loaded again later. for this purpose, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input value is automatically adjusted for all shadows, means and sun shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Overall Indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, that means you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">The left-hand side shows half of the original and the target image. the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this selection box allows the channel to be specified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box there are two icons to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images taken with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most useful. for images with large areas of a constant color, the linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode also helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a short arrow to the right, for example the bright tones, you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and that the associated image pixels become darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">A red marker is shown on the preview of the original photos. if you want to change this selection to the area you want to change, a matching line appears on the curve that represents the original value. create a point on this line and move it down and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. each curve that you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp Curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you use this method and the three color pipettes buttons automatically create the checkpoints of the curve for all channels of shadow, mid- and sun shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The Overall Indicator option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, that means you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The digiplug's channel mixer; image editing is a tool to enhance the color channels or change the color shades of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first notice how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left part of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed by comparison with your own tab.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the picture a vertical line appears in the histogram to display the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are at the bottom right: controls for red, green and construction permit you to mix these channels. if you activate luminance, the image will also retain the overall brightness as the channel mixer is then THE tool for generating great black-and-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour space. it consists of small noise artefacts that do not appear in the same place in the color channel and whose noise patterns appear differently in each channel. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the color noise first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save As and Load Buttons are used for this purpose. any mixer setting can be saved for later and then loaded. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Overall Indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, that means you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the Blue channel has been readjusted. the option Luminance Store is enabled. the original image is under (1) and the edited image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your ability to abstraction. with the development of digital photography black / white is a work step because color images can easily be converted on the computer. also with a set of film rolls profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford Panther Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orangefilter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure using a red lens filter. this creates dramatic sky-effects and can simulate lunar scenes at the time of the day. similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) Red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure using a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiece: produces warm light and medium tones as it adds a bit of cold in the shading tones. this is very similar to the process of bleaching a pressure and redevelopment in a sepiped pad. this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) sepiece filter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With & digiplug; apply tool texture you can apply decorative textures to an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your picture, regardless of whether it is a color picture or not, you can let it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the engraving of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall picture on a wall. the menu entry Image texture apply to image processing can be used for it.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: postpone this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensionality of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect is applied in the photo below. the original image is (1) and the changed under (2) to see. the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With & digiplug; tool box Add a decorative frame to add an image.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a beholder in the boundaries of a photo is not an easy task. one way to keep one's attention is to set the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you can adjust the desired frame type for your picture. the image bordered with a coloured line and a wide frame (ideal for black-and-white pictures), finishes it with a nice three-dimensional frame, which is ideal for a knock effect and decorative frame with patterns added.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the range of value for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image, decorated with the frame, will be bigger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have previously used the tool After aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can insert simple a formatted text into an image at any place. this also works at several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text direction, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it. the bigger the picture, the greater the character set. to conclude, simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Every setting you selected for your text can be changed until you press the button "OK." once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it cannot be changed any more.</seg>
<seg id="469">With & digiplug; apply tool template you can put a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Image template used in image editing can be used to create templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no limitations concerning size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to minimize the file size of the template. if you want to add your template to digiplug-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your template folder with the button Basic Folder in dialog. select the folder where you have copied the template files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the templates, a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder. the selection of a folder will automatically update the preview strip of the templates.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview you can find three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this knob increases the displayed image. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this button resumes the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you need to reduce the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below the template. to do so, take the image and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be adjusted automatically to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digiplug; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but generates grainy images especially in dark areas.</seg>
<seg id="481">We can use it to remove atmospheric dunst and it does a really good job. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is perhaps the best of the three since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adjust.</seg>
<seg id="483">Images without focus as well as most digitized images need a correction of sharpness. this is because of the digitization process colors with only minimal differences to form a color point. this in turn causes sharp edges to merge into a common color. this again causes sharp edges to be printed together. SLR cameras normally require more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for the home user.</seg>
<seg id="484">JPEG images often have a camera internal sharpening. images in raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a focus filter while reading the image. if you disable this, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get usable results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool. this allows you to use the menu entry Correcting Several.</seg>
<seg id="487">However, you should be careful because the results do not work very naturally: the sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also reinforces the noise. in general, the most useful technique to sharpen an image will refocus the tool. by refocusing, you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the picture a little bit softly is much easier than to sharpen it. use the tool for soft character with the menu entry Correcting softkeys and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unintensely masking is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview will help you to edit the image. the preview window will display the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tried first. an increase of radius or amount increases the effect.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, you should best sharpen images in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wiped image which is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference amount to be applied. thus, it is possible to define a minimum difference thus for an edge of the filter. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from sharpening and therefore avoid beauty errors in faces, ananties and water surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example for the blurred masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2). blurred masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The digiplug; tool refocus refocused an image by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright protected design algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Vienna Filtration. it uses a technique called FIR Vienna Filter. refocusing usually results in better results than blurred mask. you can start it from the menu by re-focusing colors in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauss's folding. the Gauss's folding has a very long tail, which causes the mathematical result also from the source pixiles, which are far from the original source pixel. in most cases, the FIR Vienna Inverse of the Gauss's folding is even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels. this causes undesirable results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular fold. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images the default value should result in good results. you can set a higher value if your picture is blurred then pay attention to halo notes.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very poor.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauss's sharpness. use this parameter if your sharpness Gauß is. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a nonzero value, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Die Size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase of the die size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular focus or the Gauss. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save As and Load Buttons are used for this purpose. any refocused parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to make all the trimming, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations make changes that are not visible immediately, but leave some unpleasant artefacts later.</seg>
<seg id="507">When you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">In general, unsharp masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the blurred masking a larger neighborhood used as sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically unsharp mask must always produce artefacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blurring. for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal lens filter. practically the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blurring mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">This image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the sharpness correction methods, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The smoothness controls the blur of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink ink allows a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove undesired artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail conservation p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a small value leads to an even smoothness over the picture. whereas larger values mainly smooth homogeneous regions and let details sharp. a value of 0.9 should get details in such a way that no sharpening is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes in all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film granulation or CCD Rauschen a high value wave-like patterns will generate. JPEG's artefacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary when very much noise is present, because it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is going through. normally, here is 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle-width since [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is chosen small, it should be choosen too small. make sure that small angles create a long runtime. so, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrated step width [0,1, 10]: integrated step width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation use: the more of the quality you receive by selecting this option is minimal, but it doubles the runtime. we recommend it therefore to omit it.</seg>
<seg id="527">"" "the" "" "Save As and Load" "" "buttons make this exactly. any setting of image errors can be saved to a text file and loaded again later." ""</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting graphical errors is relatively fast at work. however, it can take a long time and draw a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors can be corrected with small artifacts. the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is a peculiar black artifact in the foreground that caused by poor film storage during the trip. the original image is below (1) to see and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">& digiplug; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts that come from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; -effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot at the top shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a granular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the sub-window details and the Advanced Settings panel can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time that the filter needs per pixel and can blur the image. the area indicated by the radius is smoothed over the image and the color in it is smoothed and therefore smaller bugs removed.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel pitch behind the filter to determine luminance changes. if it is increased, noise peaks are deleted. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be obtained and noise or lubrication occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls edge accuracy for sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong it cannot be removed the entire noise or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak hissing or jpeg artifacts without losing any details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gameplay tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically more severe, but also merges the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of the phase jitter damping. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of the luminance. if it is raised, the edges appear smoother if it is too high. if it is at its minimum, noise and phase jitter may appear on the edges. it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store under and load: these buttons are used exactly for this purpose. all parameters for the noise reduction you set can be saved to the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose. fortunately, the solution to draw the picture a little bit softly is fortunately much easier than to sharpen a picture. use the tool for soft character with the menu entry Correcting softkeys and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The digiplug; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film graining, scratches, compression artifacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or subsequently digitalized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texture replacement. the texture mapping is performed with another tool, image error correction. the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG's artefacts reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossless compression algorithm, it produces some compression & quot; arteftequot; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>

<seg id="550">Photo restoration is relatively fast at work. however, it can take a long time and draw a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can be restored like a photo with uniformly noise. the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera to an Ilford (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film baskets on the faces.</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures were applied to an old color photo that was read with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts caused by the scanner illumination and the photo paper. the original image is below (1) to see and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">It uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project that are copyrighted by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high-quality raw-mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixels quot; and 'quot; Light pixelquot; on a photo with a dark picture subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Load this file into the wizard with the button dark image. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the matching dark image to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard will notice the last dark picture and will automatically load it in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview will help you correct the result within the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area around the broken pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixels. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the faulty pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to compute a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to compute a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) used to interpolate the faulty pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a faulty digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected picture is shown under (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The digiplug; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide-angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor range evenly. instead & quot; vignettequot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it also has disadvantages. many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which may increase the necessary shutter speed under certain circumstances, which makes it impossible to use the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also use a center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller as otherwise blurred effects arise through motion.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure ranges of today's filmic and grey scale depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by applying an equivalent transformation on a blank image without this filter. the tool Vignetting Correction applies the transformation using a Centerfilter to a picture. the algorithm is copyrighted by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators you can control the vignetting correction filter and with three more exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the largest density of the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which compensates for an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or at random a light intensity of 2. increase the density by a larger degree of vignetting, reduce it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Brightness, Contrast and Gamma Settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction decreases the brightness of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide positive values, since you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a more fine readjusting of the exposure of the target image, leave the values for luminosity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the Edit menu; image processing from the Color Gradation menu.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the correction correction applied to an image. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected picture.</seg>
<seg id="575">The digiplug; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortions cannot be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar circular effect, but flattens at the edges. this correction is not applied in the mold.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of fourth gradient corrects the remote corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can almost be eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of the distortion second gradient. with negative values, sound-shaped distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth degree. this value acts more strongly at the margins than in the middle of the image. for most lenses, the 'Corner parameter has the reverse character of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resumes the image size and thus results in correction of the first gradient. negative values increase while positive the image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brighten: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase them.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog provides a preview of the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonal or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or resizing changes. the best way to do this is to perform this correction as the first one. if you reopen a picture and then perform a barrel-shaped correction, the effect would be apparent.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal help line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to display the dotted lines. move it to an important place, such as the sea edge or a building wall, in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. subsequently, you can correct the barrel / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove it using the blanking tool in the Transformer Editor menu, or via the Zoom controller of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motives, e.g. shots from the front, frame and paintings, it is the perspective to correct that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera by hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the barrel-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method of simulating infrared film of the GimpGuru.org website which is accessible under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfra feature film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left of the window you can select the area for the preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters for film grading and film sensitivity (ISO). activate the merge option if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO regulator changes the amount of film grains and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in conversion. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The digiplug; filter film is an easy-to-use tool for reproducing film baskets on your pictures. this is known from classical high-speed films such as B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the makers mix large silver grains of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film gravitational effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past. the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere from everyday life. if you want to use this special, gallery-like, street photographic, granular sight especially in your monochrome photos, you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">The controller can calibrate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, set to ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film graining effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The digiplug; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The digiplug; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting. nature pictures and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">The upper one selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images. smoothness controls the smoothness or, viewed from the other side, the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the processor is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel wide image is 1 and smooth17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The digiplug; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a coal cap. images whose gradients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to sketch yourself. this would be good pictures to start.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob chooses the pin size and the lower knob adjusts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the charcoal drawing filter. the original image (1) and the changed picture (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The digiplug; filter engraving shapes your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The digiplug; filter engraving is a fast tool to give your pictures a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure, where color is not the most important in content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a gray, mondary landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to set the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is considered through glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the wavelength 1, the image is distorted using another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and produce a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the Beaming button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Sharpness: blurred the image along star-shaped lines that run from one centre. this simulates the blurring of a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurred the image by turning the pixels around a center. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blurring: blurred the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion blurring: blurred the image through horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train taking photos, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softening blurring: blurred the image softly in the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharpness: blurred the picture through a random shift of the pixels and simulates the blurring of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blur: finds the basins in the picture and blurred them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divide the photo into rectangular cells and then recreate it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel this calculation at any time with the Beaming button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool for making raindrops on your picture. this makes it natural to your pictures a wet look. it uses a patented Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Drip size allows to change the size of drops. since the drip size does not automatically increase with the size of the image, it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes change the optical effect of drops in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can with & digiplug; image processing keep an area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrops filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture (2) suggests a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can place it in the right direction by mirroring or turning. the tools for this can be found in the Transformer Rotating or Transformers menu.</seg>
<seg id="629">Blowing photo is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo at a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom in an image when the boundaries of the resolution are reached? how can you restore or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select transforming size in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog is visible below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for size change uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to increase a small picture with better quality, then try the tool to blow up.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digiplug; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo bubbles was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You have to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the new size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain aspect ratio: when this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image is maintained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary when very much noise is present, because it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">"" "the" "" "Save As and Load" "" "buttons are used for this purpose. any emulation for photo magnification can be saved as text file and loaded again later." ""</seg>
<seg id="638">Blowing photo is very fast with what it does, but it can take a long time and draw a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo bubbles by enlarging a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard magnification for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Trimming a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a commonly underestimated tool to put together a picture. in order to cut a photo, simply click the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and drawing up the rectangle, you will see this rectangle as you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again, the area of the photo will be cut off. this gives you a good overview of how your photo looks like after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by simply clicking on the corners of the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button The Cutting button of image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the file Save or File Save as in the File menu to save the newly cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview section you can change the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool Following aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format. in portrait mode, the greater value of height and width is always assigned to the width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimetres, inches or any other physical size. for example, you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog two buttons exist to center the selection automatically horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">At the bottom of the dialog you can use the Max. ratio button to cut the area to the highest possible depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool After aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation (horizontal or vertical). if you use the cutting tool next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation. the modified image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables so that the EXIF data reflect the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The setting up aid settings allow you to blend aids so that you can put your pictures together better. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic divisions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-country reins, harmonious triangles are a possibility to share a rectangle in a similarly harmonious triangles at the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden center is a division which affects various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus Muscle or the flower leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things we perceive as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden partition is the irrational number 1,6180988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number derives from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; the resulting divider is equal to 1: 1.618 the golden middle.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides more fluid guides when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden spiral will give you good results for your photos. compared to the third rule, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition guides the observer's gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual river in this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. there should be something that distracts the eye to the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangles also derive from the golden spiral discussed above. your vertices are the center points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that unlike harmonic triangles, golden triangles are not equilateral triangles. diagonal to these lines can be released a static object more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The horizontal mirroring and vertical mirroring options can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the help lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the help lines can become invisible. in this way, you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">When you make a photo, it happens easily that you do not hold the camera exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which the things are rotated around an angle. you can do this with the & digiplug; image processing and the tool free rotation. select Transformers Free Rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your picture with the slider angle. the values on this slider are given in degrees. with the button Preferences you can reset the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the upper right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines. after you moved it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you shot an image you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix this is to use the Transforming function from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to crop the image is to slice Automatically. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The Anti-Aliasing option smoothes the picture a bit after the turn. however, keep in mind the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectival transformations are performed by a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then automatically recomputed. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle to the top left: indicates the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle on the right: indicates the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle to the left: indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right below: indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the picture is slightly smeared. this effect is small for a single adjustment, but two adjustments create a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adjusted the perspective, you get unhappy triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean this is to cut the picture with transformer cores from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">A horizontal shear, for example, will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the bottom part to the left. this is no rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module via transformation scissors.</seg>
<seg id="679">Rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you press presets, the angles are reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview window.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the locking tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the scaling, the picture is a bit blurred. for a single shot, this effect is mostly negligible, but two shearings produce twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the scaling, the picture has triangular triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate this is to cut the picture with transformer cores from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digiplug; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, of the way these libraries are compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digiplug.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependency on other libraries it is impossible to make a list of all file formats available on your system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>

<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems starting from around 1000 nodes and a hack to represent more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further required software: & kgraphicviewer; is a & kde; program, which presupposes the & graphviz; tool & dot; for displaying the graphs. requires in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in its own sub-window. initially, if you start & kgraphicviewer; without an argument, the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot. in this case, the toolbar only contains the symbol file and the (empty) list Recently opened files. click on the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After selecting one or more & dot files, the main window looks like in the bottom of the screen:</seg>

<seg id="739">If you open a graph file outside of a running & node instance, & eg; in the file browser or the command line, you have the choice whether you want to open a new & kgraphicviewer; instance or to display the graphs to be loaded in a sub-window of the current instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but also change it with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">At program start, you can reopen all graphs of your last session again. again, you can save your choice as well as change later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph is to be split into several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use multiple pages, you can choose whether the sections of the graph coming to one page will be adjusted to this page. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph.</seg>

Flickr makes it possible to send your photos to people who are important. you can show your favorite photos of the world, make photos of your camera mobile online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The Export module to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time you will be guided through the process of generating a token. this will be used for your authentication. it is thus virtually your ID to Flickr. a browser is started so that you can log in at Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After successful login, the module can send photos to Flickr website. the following page will be presented to you after a successful login.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after pressing Yes, you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">If the Export module is started to Flickr for the second time, you will be greeted with the following dialog, which shows the current access permissions that the module displays. currently, the module does not support any other permissions. you will be asked if you want to proceed with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button to add photos should be pressed once you have set all the other options. with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. if you press the Ok button, upload the photos to Flickr server.</seg>
<seg id="803">The keyword field can be filled with a comma separated list of words. these are added to the image as the keywords during the upload.</seg>

<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographical localization allows you to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographic data are stored in the EXIF keywords of the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographical localization provides tools for locating images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and width degrees are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization correlator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and enter the menu. the above-looking dialog appears then. in order to run a possible correlation between time and localization, you must load a track file with GPX file. this file contains of course data that were recorded at the same time at the same locations as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed which shows the coordinates in red. GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT. this can be done with the time zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for maximum time deviation indicates an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time. if the deviation is below, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you don't have trace data from a place for images, you can manually edit the gpx file and add it to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in minutes can be used if you have no matching dates. if you know that in reality a location is located in a great time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then push the button correlated to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful when you have made a number of photos in the same place. since the dialog is changing the coordinates from one call to the next you only need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and placed with the displayed map. select the region in question and zoom in. enter it again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the map can be switched between map mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI Module Photo Gallery is a tool for exporting a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums which are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set will be encoded by UTF-8 to provide the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted. the Rider selection allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML. the albums are not displayed hierarchically. with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab Appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this tab is largely self-explanatory. the option For each picture creates a page creating a gallery in which each image will also get a page. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer, & eg; Kuickshow</seg>
<seg id="825">The Rider Album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all of your associated images. select a folder where you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLExport which contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG image format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">You can change the default color depth with other color depth. this naturally also influences the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The thumbnail tab allows you to adjust some of the settings from the Album rider for thumbnails, these are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. therefore, you can read the program messages to see if errors occurred during the creation. the web browser will be automatically started at the end to preview the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool for viewing images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as turning, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons. it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is shown by default in full screen mode. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless Module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows to save images in JPEG format for the actions below, without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of loss-free storage is that the file size increases, since no compression of the color information takes place. this can be found e.g. in the PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module Digital Camera Client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client has no documentation at the moment. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailinglist of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Respect: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the kde-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the Import function of the metadata module you can copy data from one image to another. select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the import function. this will then open the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image, i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere but not in any target format. JPEG is supported while writing. please look at exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Encoding module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG-encoder module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages. you can also add an audio file to the MP2 or WAV of Slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can select a background color for slideshow. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD Player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">First, you need to select the images to be packed into the MPEG Slideshow. after that, you can create the MPEG Slideshow Creator module to start the module.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you have selected are then listed in the portfolio under image files. there you can also modify the images or the content of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">The video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to play the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should specify the time in seconds a picture is displayed. the speed of the image transition is defined below. a low value creates very sudden, a high, very smooth picture change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in case of doubt, you should leave it black. you can specify the name and path of the generated file by name of the MPEG output file. keep the extension mpg as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file with the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adjusted all settings to your wishes, you can start producing the movie with the knob. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now quickly or quietly drink a coffee and enjoy the slide show if you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a suggestion appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages via the button Settings at the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="852">Print Assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together with standard photo prints. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp. this is, for example, useful to enhance or print directly with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import or convert your RAW-format images to one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool drapw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from him is: do not expect from drapw that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file you want to convert and start the module. the Raw Image Converter window then appears in mode for a single image. with the Preview button, you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance. the essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amps can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can further edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch does not have any effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename will remain the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image Format, TIFF, retains all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you plan to frequently process your images or otherwise use it elsewhere, you should not choose the JPEG format, since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is worsened. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the EXIF information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start conversion with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">The batch editing mode allows you to convert different images at once. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, you have the possibility to override existing files automatically. however, this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in one album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the start number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce or enlarge the image. in addition, four types of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in one dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on the image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 digits.): size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio remains unchanged. for example, you can use this option to adjust your image to the screen size.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: a disproportionate size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Print preparation: prepare the image for photo printing. the user can set the print resolution and size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, will be adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you started the module, the images window will be displayed with the images selected by you. you can add more images via the button Add images. for the last image you have selected, you will see a preview on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag pictures to the picture list and place them there to add the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">Using the button to remove images, the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the images, you can open the new message window of your e-mail client using the OK button. you only have to add the addresses and the subject. the images you have selected are attached as attachments.</seg>
<seg id="877">Pay attention not to send too many pictures at once. most e-mail accounts have limitations on the size of sending emails. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your E-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you will need to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you are using the Google Mail Service, you must first install the Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in a attached file, the comments to the images will be added to a text file and attached to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats like TIFF. therefore, you should use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select a JPEG image file format and the original files are in JPEG format, then the original Excel data will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status messages, in search of errors. however, your e-mail program will be automatically started at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Diaschau a window appears with questions like you want to have shown your slideshow. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL option in the presentation activates very elegant image transitions by using OpenGL. however, you need to have a corresponding graphic card because otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The File ename option ensures that the filename of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an endless loop. you can then manually cancel it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option to select images randomly makes sure that the images are displayed in random order. so, not the order of the images is used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Between the images the temporal distance between the images can be set. 1500 milliseconds are 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect.</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can choose. randomly, each transition between the images selects another effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide show you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this tool bar, you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and the next image and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">On the left lower edge of the screen you can see the current file name, position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">If you are interested in writing, please contact the mailinglist of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Respect: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool for setting a picture as background image for the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">As soon as you have annotated your pictures and videos with notes, you can browse with & kPhotoAlbum; browse through them, see picture. as you can see by comparing them with the image, there are now in each group, i.e. in people, places and in group keyword entries.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window, you will see the categories for which you have entered information as you have provided your images and videos with annotations. in addition, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course see the current thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you mouse on the entry persons, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person, only the images are displayed on which both persons are to be seen. through this selection method, you can restrict the number of displayed pictures from a few thousand images to a few individual images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the people, places and other settings, you can display thumbnails to view the images of your area of action.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture, each person has the same icon in front of her name. you can use & kPhotoAlbum; however, for each person to save his own thumbnail, this also applies to places, keywords and other categories you have defined yourself.</seg>
<seg id="904">To display pictures next to the names, select the button located on the right side of the toolbar. in the appearing context menu, you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can display icons with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you will need to specify which image is to be displayed for each individual. to do so, you will need to open the image view window (described in more detail) and display the image for the corresponding person in the context menu. in the view window, you can adjust the magnification factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you call the Search in the main window, a dialog appears, which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can view this dialog once more.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string into the caption or description field, the descriptions or descriptions of the images will be searched by this text. if you would like, you can also enter a date after which it is to be searched; the date can be either a part of the total date, i.e., for example 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all the pictures for certain names, as you can see in the picture. here, pictures on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the User Manual for & kPhotoAlbum; if you don't like to read manuals, but rather want to try functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the home page of & kphotoalbum; and take a look at the quick entry, the screenshots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kPhotoAlbum; and in the first dialog, select the demo in case you start & kPhotoAlbum; start the first time, or select the menu entry kPhotoalbum; demo. as a result, some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of & kphoto album.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print out this manual, you will find it on the home page of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphoto album; see the timeline. a picture of this bar you can see here:. as the name says, this bar shows you data statistics about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">You can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database (if you select a date, the first image of this date will be displayed in the preview window) and the timeline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a section of the time line by holding the mouse button down and drag the mouse over the ruler of the time line, i.e. the timeline. if you select an area, you will only see images of this period in the preview window. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a timeline bar.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kPhotoalbum; provides you two ways to create HTML pages with your pictures. one is in & kPhotoAlbum; integrated and the other as module available (see). in the following part of the user manual, the in & kphoto album; integrated version which you can create through the menu File HTML... can be called.</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages, you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and target. in the following, each area is described more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="919">First enter the title of the title and a description which should contain the HTML file later. on kphoto album; HTML example pages you will see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select to create a & kphotoalbum; export file should be created on the overview page. you will find more information about the export files in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can choose which information to be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid displaying information that is obvious to the viewer without a description. for example, that all images are from a party.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unambiguous, which is why this is not specifically addressed.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. this means that those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, do not have any images, for example having a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time you defined. so it can browse your images with low resolution, which results in a lower transmission time. if he wants to get an image bigger he changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting area you specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">For all of your HTML files, select a basic folder and create a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder where all your images are saved. this folder will be saved and added next time. this allows you to select the location for all future images. here you can either select a folder or a protocol supported by KDE, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if they are really all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser after the pages have been created will be started. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files you created are not yet in the final destination folder, you need to manually copy them there. in order for the import function, see, correctly, you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings that have just been described have all of them related to basic folders and URLs. a subfolder will be created in this folder, whose name you specify in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphoto album; coming together, you may want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures. however, if you have already spent a lot of time applying the image information, people on the pictures, recording location, etc., you will need to work with & kphotoalbum; this work will not do again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kPhotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file, which you can import others into your database.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or whether the file is only a shortcut to images. the advantage of storing all images in the file is that you have all the images together and that you can share this file independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can either export a .kim file directly from the Export menu... or along with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in two ways. first, it searches the images that are located in the folder of the .kim file. if the corresponding images are not found, then the images of the URL you have entered when creating the HTML files are scanned. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can view from the Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. there are three choices available to you:</seg>
<seg id="938">With option Manual in the vicinity of the .kim file, you have to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically copied file near the .kim file copy & kphotoalbum; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zip files. since most images were already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worth compressing the files. if you want to do so, simply choose the export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the images in full size since the .kim file would otherwise be very large. for example, you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">When you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the Import... menu, will select & kphotoalbum; import the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The Import wizard consists of four steps. first you have to select which images you want to import, then in which folder the importing images should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category people of the file to be imported (if you are a Dane) while this category is in your database. therefore, in the third dialog window, you will be asked what categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories they correspond in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. an example of this can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and view pictures: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump within different picture groups & mdash; if you look for example pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will go through the various steps of (1) inserting information about your images, over (2) viewing and viewing, up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum has been started as a program for managing your pictures. however, it has been extended and today it takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual is talked about images, but often this also includes videos.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kPhotoalbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the topmost folder of its images. this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a disk or revisions in CVS, where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kPhotoalbum; remembers the folder where your images are stored and automatically restores it at future starts. if you want to read another database in & kphoto album, you can start & kphotoalbum; with the -c option. as an example: kphoto album -c ~ / company / pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">The menu entry settings kPhotoalbum; set up... get to a window with which you can change the settings of & kPhotoAlbum; in the following section of the user manual, you will learn the different settings.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different icons that allow you to view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can access by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It has been described in detail how to set different properties for each picture, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog that is used to edit existing groups. for each existing group, you can select a caption and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">Subcategories have already been mentioned in the section. in the Options dialog, you can set up complete member groups, i.e. all members of a group at a time in a group, rather than explaining all groups of a member as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the list box you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window there is a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; divides its module system with other graphics applications, such as digiBOam and Gwenview. this modular system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called via the Module menu. the modules can and will not be described in this manual since they are not part of & kphotoalbum, but are sold separately. however, most modules have a help page, which you can call through the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are shared by several applications together, it may be that the modules were tested with & kPhotoAlbum; this is why you should always test new modules first with the demo database before you apply them to your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that the modules use in common with KIPI are very different, making it possible for some modules to work with & kPhotoAlbum; this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphoto album and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications put their pictures into albums: an album is simply a folder. even though & kphoto album; this kind of order does not support, it simulates the order for some modules for albums so that you can use the functions with & kPhotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulating & kPhotoalbum; the current album, which is simply the current view, so all the pictures you see at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, & kPhotoAlbum, the modules also have to pass a list of albums. here goes & kphoto album; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kPhotoalbum; s Browser shows the contents of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it is used the category you set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you use the category people, & kPhotoAlbum; so do so, so if you would have selected people to view and pass this on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphoto album are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the settings dialog and select modules to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are accustomed to using any other KDE application, you will see a menu and toolbar at the top. at the moment, it does not contain a lot of information, since you do not yet have any information about your images. in the section we will go back to this window, but just click on the picture to show you an overview of all existing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to provide each image with annotations. this includes information about the persons appearing in the picture, etc. you can set each picture individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time. if for example, shown on all pictures Jesper and all pictures taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for browsing and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these notes when using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view, you can see three lists with a text box by enabling people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphoto album, since you will always be able to use them when you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on moving images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and on all 50 images the same 5-10 persons are depicted, you can, because the names used are shifted upward, the people find and assign them faster.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you would rather like to get an alphabetically sorted list, click on the Sort button below the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each image individually, you might want to edit all the selected images and annotate these images with annotations. in this case simply click on the before and back buttons located below the thumbnail of the picture on the upper right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have recorded multiple images, e.g. with the same person, it can be more comfortable to mark all these images and use the menu item to add more entries at once with a comment.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the US. San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">In the picture you will see a browser window that shows the USA as an over-group. to show you that it is an overgroup, a special icon will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the comment dialog it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over- or subcategory. in addition, you can simply drag an entry to a category and put it there to make it a subcategory of this entry. caution, this assumes that you just sort your categories alphabetically.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the buttons that form the top edge of the frame. you can also make a separate window from a frame by dragging it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adjusted the appearance of the window to your needs, that you are satisfied with the settings, click the Options button..., among other things, allows you to save the current setup and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely fade out a frame. if you would like to see this window later on, use the Options button... and then pop up a window. this will be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the image display in the browser, you will get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected pictures, or all images in case you have not set a filter. an example of this can be seen here. you can configure the size of thumbnails, by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button. just try it.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image is set as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this will be shown in the picture viewer. if you have not opened a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the image preview. simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the Remove button or select Delete Selection in the Edit menu. now you will see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kPhotoalbum; you can use & kPhotoalbum for this problem. you can also use & kphotoalbum without saving you on your hard drive. of course you have to store the pictures somewhere, thus & kphotoalbum. in the picture you will see the view of & kphoto album; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images in which the right upper corner is cut off are not stored on the hard drive. however, for the pictures 5-9 the thumbnails are present, so that & kphotoalbum can show you the preview of these images. however, you can't view these pictures with the picture viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see this feature requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them again. & kphotoalbum; do not support it until now you want to avoid inserting the respective CD. so if you want to avoid the confusion of your pictures, please buy a larger hard drive to save all images.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu pictures you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the pictures so that at the end those you want to make for others inaccessible and click "Update View" in the Privacy menu. alternatively, you can also select all the images that your little sister is allowed to see, and select the menu item All except current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">This means you have defined which images should be hidden in the case of the case. if you now give your laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu entry images, whereby all the images you have locked are hidden. if you want to see the pictures again, click on the lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply change the password in the Privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please bear in mind that this photo protection is by no means very secure. on the one hand, all images on the hard disk and on the other, anyone who can access the file index.xml can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection is only used to hinder the view of private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you spend all your pictures with & kphoto album; manage and spend hours over hours with it is, of course, that you want to look at them sometime. for this reason, & kphoto album; through an image _ and video viewer.</seg>
<seg id="994">You can see the viewer in. it shows, of course, the picture, but additional all the information you have entered across the picture, such as who is in the picture, when and where has it been made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the info box on the upper part of the image you want to see, you can simply drag it with the mouse and put it elsewhere. you can also configure which information is displayed and whether any information is displayed at all. all these options are available right-clicking on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the infobox are underlined. if you click on this, the browser displays matching entries to this. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser displays all pictures of Anne Helene. as if you would have selected persons from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have downloaded several images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image up and down. you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and End. these functions are also available from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slide show. & kphotoalbum; loads a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be checked by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer's & kphoto album; it is possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the entire space on the screen. simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can zoom in and zoom into the image. you can simply zoom in a rectangle with the mouse. with the minus button you can zoom in again. the plus button zooms in the middle of the image. shows how a zoom angle is selected and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the key-key, the zooms set, so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work with videos that are in and out with the plus and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the screenshots from the context menu, you can rotate the image. this does not work with videos. you can make notes to the current image using the menu item Notices from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">When you look at images it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the image. at the moment you can view this and open configuration dialog of the image to include this name. however, you may prefer to select only the image and view more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad as you view one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to provide images with features while you view them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter. see a picture in which the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have added features to your pictures, these are available in your browser. so if you have all the images you edit, print or whatever you have chosen, just add all of them at once. then you can use a module to copy the selected images onto a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in thumbnail view. if you want to view categories in the preview view, you can add features to the images by simply selecting the characters for the feature after the image was selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case, you can use the photo album on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The batch is not saved with the image but in the database. in this way, you can revert your painting later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to activate the painting mode of & kphotoalbum, select View on the image from the contextual menu. to finish painting simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To be able to work with & kpovmodeler, you need to have the application of the program & Povray; not complete control, but the documentation to & Povray; should you have absolutely read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wire model views.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the subobject of an object already selected, since all objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and either click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu is displayed to allow you to select the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">Deleting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button context menu, you can remove selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to take these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message with a fault description will be displayed. then you can correct the input errors and click Apply or Subject the Changes with Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; -user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this property. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. as default the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to render a subitem element (for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), tick locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screen shot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and thereby change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the checkpoints disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse inside the whole window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a Visibility level as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the point of view of the parent object or as absolute value. objects will only be displayed when selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility level of the scene selected in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the default window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement, you can set it as required. you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different configurations.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window over or under a present view, drag the beginner to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then displays the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the beginner to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to order several views on top of one another, drag the beginner right in the middle of another view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the flashcards at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from anchoring, drag the starter to the desktop or click the small arrow pointing to the left in the bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the Address bar. to prevent the closing, click the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the View menu you can find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any place.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can save you with View window order... Save. a dialog appears where you can save the window order under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render it renders. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 current. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on Rendering the Rendering icon in the toolbar or select the menu entry View scene render.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of render modes, from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or select Render modes in the View Mode menu, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it is a name that makes sense to recognize the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the size of the map you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the picture, select the check box subsection and enter the image section to render into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the quality drop-down selector you can select the properties, the & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuse reflection light. a detailed description of render properties can be found in the User Manual & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel, various errors can arise. these images often have a moiré pattern or stepped effect in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel in the picture. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, pictures with this feature look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn on anti-aliasing, calculate and connect & Povray; more than a beam per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptively because the super-sampling refers to the neighboring pixels. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively because each pixel is fragmented and adapted again and again because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method, POV-Ray tracks a beam per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, then both pixels are processed by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4 extra points will be calculated, at a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the default threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are followed individually and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process called Jittering. if you turn on Jittering, changed & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection is calculated. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the corresponding beams have not hit the object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly terminated, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; file, select the Import menu item... and select a file in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently, & kpovmodeler; not yet the full command range of & Povray; if error messages or warnings appear when importing, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeling; import, write this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRAwBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source text for & Povray; this inserts the source text of the object into the opened text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeling; and in your editor you can paste source text for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click help in the property view, open & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation for the displayed object. set the path to your document and the version here. supported versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example height-field data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the scene folder, you must also enter the path to these files here. if a file occurs in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used to display the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used to display the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window-type registration plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object bycatch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wiremodel views. here you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotation.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more precise wire model and therefore a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects like the sphere, you can set the detail level separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross the high level of detail for extended projections, all wire model views are further subdivided when the camera uses an extended projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions to the perspective and the vertical projections. this property results in a better approach for projections, but requires more time to render.</seg>
<seg id="1068">If you tick the wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is represented in a checkerboard pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you tick the bottom, a bottom is rendered below the objects. the floor is displayed in a checkerboard pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you check out edge smoothing, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold value.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can modify existing window orders or create new window orders. in the window directive section explains how to create and store windows orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">Drop down selector Default window arrangement: shows all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing windows orders shows all existing window orders. a new arrangement allows you to create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement using the Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all views for the selected window order. you can create new views using the Add button and delete selected views with the Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">With New column, create a new column on the right hand side of the existing windows, with Unten you can fix the window under the existing window, with tab card you get a flashcard view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only receive a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules for rendering can be applied, as a result you will get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you will only get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything without error, see the first start of & kpovmodeling; the following default window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing toolbar icons. please read the documentation so you can get an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols frequently so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">In order to follow this guide you first have to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the Edit Delete menu item. thus you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera views the whole scene you create. in particular, you notice that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the User Documentation to & Povray; see for it more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera. simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">Using the Apply button or the Enter key, the wiremodel views and the object tree immediately change according to these settings. as a result, you can see the scene from the view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. for example, you might insert a header (insert Endlicher Cad Quader) and adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method of solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeling; actually offers a simpler option. you can use an infinite plane as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the layer in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply button or the Enter key. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now also displays the level, even if at the moment only a limited finite level. when you render the scene, the plane expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">You will see the different parameters of the object. in this case, you will only see the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and displacement. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the soil to the horizontal line in order to get to know some of these parameters. select shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but at the moment select something simple.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog opens, in which you can select how the object is to be inserted. the pigment will then be displayed in the property tree. you can change the name in the property view (Name = bottom pigment), by clicking on the Preview button you will see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigment only shows a matte black material because you need to re-enter settings for the pigment. therefore, always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see any color on the box and sphere in preview, just click on the Apply button and then click the Preview button.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you now render your picture with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color you expected. here are additional settings necessary. in the color list you have to enter two new attributes, called single color. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more often, but the board color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, select single-colour and change the colors in the object properties view:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should be able to do this step by simply because you should have understood the basic method of working & kpovmodeler; already understood. the ball can be created just as easily as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties, you can instantly change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (do not forget to press the input button or the Apply button), so the ball has contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball would float above the ground as you moved the ground around one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course rendering now gives a strange result: as seen before, the ball surface appears like a matte black material. in the following step, set a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as already with the floor, give the sphere a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select the first subobject and change the name for example in sphere pigment. click sphere pigment, then select Unicoloured and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screenshots and click Apply or press the Enter key.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The gloss effect and reflection sometimes result in good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromium-plated surfaces even if metal: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities you and kpovmodeler have. hopefully, you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is a Render method to create a two dimensional image of a three dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you raytracing a scene, the render shoots hypothetical rays from the viewer's perspective (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this beam is reflected and broken through the objects, the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you view the scene. without a light source you can see nothing, the picture is just black. obviously, every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog you can select a file you previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and a disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since last saved are discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you have unsaved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last reverted command. this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Save the current window order and open a dialog, in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, keyboard shortcut and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog for modifying the keyboard shortcuts. you can use this option default short commands for & kpovmodeler; change commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up the toolbar. you can add and remove tool symbols for & kpovmodeler, using this option.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump-Map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each bite on the surface individually and without changing the geometrical form of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for both a dump-map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic elements are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of this basic body. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel base by applying an image file as a color map.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickShow; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser. the application has a file browser where you can select images for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickShow; is very easy. the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking the & LMBn; or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set whether each image should be displayed in your own window or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are searching for a specific file, just type the first character of the file name in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the bottom right corner. if a suitable file name has been found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In the dialog Configuration - & kuickShow; there are five card cards. in three of them, General and editing and slideshow, you can set the mode of operation of & kuickShow; in the two other, short commands for the display window and short instructions for the browser, the shortcuts for each window can be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, the images will be opened in full screen mode. if the image is not large enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color you can set further below. default is not full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">This point activates, loads & kuickshow; already the next image in the folder, while you still look at the current image. this reduces the delay when you select the next image, and is particularly suitable for a slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="1137">With this option, & kuickshow; at the end, the name of the last opened folder. at the next start & kuickshow; this folder in the browser window.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Click on the colored bar to select a background color. this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode. if in window mode the window is larger than the image, the background is filled with the selected color.</seg>
<seg id="1139">You can & kuickShow; set up that only some of the file types that the program can display.</seg>
<seg id="1140">With this option, the display window is enlarged to the full screen for large images. this option is turned on as default.</seg>
<seg id="1141">Determines whether the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image.</seg>
<seg id="1142">To change the value, you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows on the right of the input field. the default is 3 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1143">The number of repetitions. if this value is set to 0, the slideshow will be repeated until it is aborted by the user. to change the value, you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows on the right of the input field. default is 1.</seg>
<seg id="1144">Here's the shortcut for the different modes of & kuickshow; in the flashcards short commands for the display window and short instructions for the browser.</seg>
<seg id="1145">With this option, switch between the two-part view of the filesystem (a window for the subfolders and a window for the files) and the one-part view of the file system with folders and files in one window.</seg>

Select.</seg>
<seg id="1182">You can set up any existing multimedia keys in such a way that they work as & Amarok; -Shortcuts. this makes your keyboard a & Amarok; control center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general functions that are mostly found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe DCOP functions from collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlist browser and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports command line options from Qt and & kde; in addition, Amarok has some of its own command-line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script whether all required modules are present and use cdialog to make the user know why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Rescue LoadError error =' corundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script. 'kdialog --sorry' # {error} '' exit end</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates directory, you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use it as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand it with the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which each KDE installation should be included.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow executing external programs and commands. for this, the exec () function is usually used. in this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends notifications to all running scripts. for this purpose, strings are written to the default script input. for this reason, scripts should continuously monitor their default input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can ignore events even if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Weist the script to display the setup dialog. to save and load the setup data, each script must take care of itself. when a script is started, Amarok puts the work folder on the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signals that a new piece is being played. the script could now & zb; with DCOP functions, ask for more information about the new piece (for example the metadata or the piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">The volume change newVolume signal changes the volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomisuClicked: sub-menu itemDrill: contains the path to the selected files of the playlist, when a custom menu entry can be clicked. to remove an entry, you can use the DCOP function dcop Amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (Submenu itemAlbum).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; terminates, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to perform e.g. cleaning up data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install script packages which the user & zb has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.bz2), which can also be compacted with bzip2 (.bz2), so that the user can clearly see the archive as a Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the markup amarca script. for this reason, you should correctly name your script packages.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file permissions:</seg>
<seg id="1199">When your script package is finished, you can upload it to www.kde-apps.org and link to the Wiki script page by & Amarok; for your entry on kde-apps, you should use the Amarok category; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus. maybe you just search for a very specific title from thousands in your collection. with & Amarok; s Collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Maybe you already have some playlists, but can't decide which you want to hear? then the playlist browser is exactly the right thing for you. and if the decision is still difficult, select the dynamic mode and the smart playlists automatically select the right music based on certain criteria.</seg>

<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually saved playlists: if you enable this setting, & Amarok; relative paths to the music files, starting from the location of the playlist, will be stored. otherwise, the absolute position of the music files is stored.</seg>
<seg id="1218">To keep track of the current piece change, the playlist window will pop up / unroll in order to always keep the running piece in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">When changing parts to context-browser, the context-browser automatically changes as soon as the next piece is played.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section you can adjust the appearance and Amarok's appearance. the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the fonts section you can set the use of various fonts in & Amarok. by selecting Custom fonts, the otherwise gray represented section is enabled. you can select fonts for the following area: playlist windows, Player Windows and Context Browser. click Select..., so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog.</seg>

<seg id="1224">Set up the On-Screen display allows you to turn on the OSD. when using on-screen display, a preview of the OSD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click Select... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OSD. the check box shadow causes the text to be shaded in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">You can use your own colors to customize the OSD colors for font and background. clicking on the color spaces will open the dialog for color selection. if you do not use own colors, the default colors will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The display text input field displays the text displayed in the OSD. by entering wildcards, the OSD can be adapted to your needs. below you will find a list of available placeholders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The screen option is intended for Xinama users, allowing you to specify which screen of a multiple monitor environment the OSD is to appear.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The Audio Output tab lets you select an audio driver from the drop-down box. some drivers enable further settings in this tab card.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The collection card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection. this includes the folders and type of database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folder, which & Amarok; to search for music files. to include a folder in the collection, select the check box next to its name. this section also contains check boxes for setting how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Browse subfolders recursively: this causes & Amarok to browse both the selected and their subfolders by music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitor changes: allows & Amarok; to monitor the selected folder on changes (e.g. added or deleted music files). in addition, an incremental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import playlists: causes & Amarok; add all found playlists in your collection folders (.pls- and .m3u files) to your collection. the automatically added playlists will appear later in the playlist browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The part collection database is used to select a database for the collection. the drop down selector driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further setup in the MySql subwindow is necessary.</seg>

<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (like & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the package kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you have to have kdelibs so installed (including the included programs, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts).</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions, such as the OSD, assume that your window manager keeps the relevant standards from freedesktop.org. so Gnome will work, but fluxbox will support for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt as these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">You can locate the file in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the Taglib developers under bugs.kde.org and append the file that caused the crash. after that you can delete the file and let the collection be created again.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Mostly this is because taglib crashes when reading the meta-information from this file. please report this error to the Taglib developers at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for it in & Amarok; is a little more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all of & Amarok; used libraries compiled with the same compiler version. if e.g. & Amarok; compiled with GCC 3.4, Taglib but with GCC 3.3.X, this leads to crashes when editing meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then disable automatically when inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least do not use a value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by e-mail (the e-mail automatically opens at a crash). if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error is guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 in the meta-info, but do not mark it as a Unicode. the following perl script resolves the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl die "The file $ARGV [0] does not exist" unless -f $ARGV [0]; use MP3:: Mplib; my $mp3 tag = $MP3- &gt; "unless $MP3- &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>

<seg id="1326">Creating a playlist is very easy. drag items from the collection browser to the playlist. the small text field for filtering the collection makes it easier for you to search for certain pieces. if you are happy with the playlist, you can save it by using the button Playlist. you will find this button in the toolbar of the playlist window.</seg>
<seg id="1327">If you have own playlists, you can add them to the playlist browser. if the playlist is included in the folder of your collection, and you have enabled the option to import playlists, you will find that playlists are already in the tree view. by right-clicking on a playlist, you will find various ways to load the playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1331">& Amarok; requires installation of some software packages. the required packages are listed below. in addition, some additional packages are listed that make work with & Amarok; more pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="1332">If you install these packages via a package management system (e.g. RPM or apt), you must also install the development versions of these packages!</seg>
<seg id="1333">& Amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. like any normal multimedia player has also & Amarok; a player window with the most important features.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & Amarok are used, including creating a collection and playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The player window is your one-click & Amarok; control center. at the top of the window is a running text display showing the currently running piece or the current stream. just below is the area, the game time, bit rate and samplerate of the current piece. a click on this area changes the display of the already expired season to the remaining time of play.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, also under the runtime display. you can switch by using the available analyzer by clicking with the left mouse button on the area.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press d on your keyboard and the current analyzer will be displayed in an independent, enlarged window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">The button PL activates or deactivates the playlist window while the EQ button is used to set up equalizers.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the play-positional slider. use the sliders to adjust the play position or volume. with the playback buttons you can start / stop playing and switch to the next or previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">Using the built-in equalizer is easy and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets, from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own preferences.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To display the equalizer, use Extras Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you select the Equalizer check box, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The playlist of & Amarok; is the most advanced playlist of all for & kde; available multimedia player. it has many functions that do not exist in any other player. but don't let the abundance of functions deter you, they are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlist window can be divided into two main areas, the navigation pane is on the left. in the navigation pane you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist, such as the context browser. the playlist itself is easy to use, but even for advanced users Powerful enough.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context-browser displays various information regarding the current piece. its appearance can be adapted with the help of context-browser design. the context-browser contains three sub-windows: music, text and artist.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & Amarok, you might notice that the sub-window has dropped off. the information displayed there has now been distributed to other parts of & Amarok; furthermore, the information can be viewed in the statistics window (Extras statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music below shows information about the currently running piece, as well as the artist and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this sub-window displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz icon. click on this icon to look up the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Under the MusicBrainz icon you will find further information on the current piece. you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To display cover images in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png are supported. the context browser will also display cover images, which are either downloaded with the cover management or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended plays. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the receptions there are the favourite pieces of this artist. this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current artist.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set which information is to be displayed in the music sub-window. right-click anywhere in the sub-window and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the artist, lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will work out and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all pieces in the individual fields to start playing immediately. you can also click with the right mouse button on it and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">This function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites with the help of self-written scripts. as soon as you click the text sub-window, try & Amarok; to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if no text script is yet running, you can choose which should be started.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the song text. the modified version is then stored in & Amarok; s Collection database. no running text script is needed.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Search button opens a search on google.com after the song text for the running piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Interpret - grouped only the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the performer. albums or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Interpret / Album - First the pieces are arranged according to the artist and a further distribution is made after the respective album. if you want to see compositions or soundtrack albums, this is the best view on your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list among different interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping Interpret / year - Album - sorted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (the newest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is used.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All records of your collection are sorted alphabetically among each other. the artist will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping Genre / Interpret - your pieces will be listed first by genre, including by artist.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping genre / artist / album - This setting works just like the above, but is additionally sorted by album under the artist.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons you can adjust and combine the grouping as you like.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically re-record your collection as soon as you change something to the selected folder. if you own many pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">A search filter is located directly below the toolbar. it is the same in the list view as well as in the tree view. instructions for using this filter can be found in the section to the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter there is a selection field with which you can filter the recently added pieces to your collection. you can also select different time slots, from the last 24 hours to a year. furthermore, you can of course select your entire collection, whereby the filter is practically switched off.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser you will get the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This clears the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Append to playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry you will reach the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces in queue - This function will add the selected pieces to the queue. this will play you next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected songs as a playlist. you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transfer to media player - add the pieces to the Media Player queue for transfer to the Media Player. see the Media Player browser section for more details.</seg>
<seg id="1374">All pieces of this artist burn / burn on CD - This will enable the selected pieces to be sent to K3b and burned either as a data CD or as an audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option will not be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - Open the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(n) Move files to the garbage bin... - Opens a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">As a compilation, select the selected album as a compilation, whereupon it appears among different interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Pick up a compilation-mark - Change an album marked as a compilation, back to a normal album. after that the album will not be displayed under different interpreters but again under the associated interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlist browser makes it easy to handle many playlists. among other things, it also contains smart playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart playlists. they use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with pieces in your collection that have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created smart playlists are possible. click on Smart Playlist to open the dialog for creating a new smart playlist, where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The Media Player sub-window is used for the connection of & Amarok; with your portable media player (e.g. iPod). for example, to use your iPod with & Amarok; in / mnt / ipod. if & Amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod sorted by artist in the top list view of the Media Player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired songs from the playlist and drop them on the list Interpret. if you're done, click Apply. this will upload the pieces to your iPod. if the transfer is finished, quit & Amarok; and solve the drive integration for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar, there is a search area with which you can search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list all files are hidden, which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can fetch music from a given URL. if you enter for example tar: / home / mike / musi.tar.gz and press Enter, you can access music in the file musi.tar.gz. now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, the attachment of files can be difficult by simply dropping down. in this case, the holding of the Shift key can be helpful: this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list, and not at the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">You can change the order by simply drag the entries with the mouse to the desired place. once you enter alphabetic letters, only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed. in order to reset the filter, press the return key until the text box is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter search terms separated by spaces, & Amarok; search for entries containing all search terms. for example, if you enter a two three, the search will find all entries containing one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">For example, one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces containing one or two or three (or a combination thereof) are found.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries containing spaces, then enclose the search term with goose feet: Mike Oldfield. this will look for entries that include Mike Oldfield, but not for entries like Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a particular search column, you can also search for larger or smaller ones. for example: rating: &gt; 50. this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -something searches for pieces that do not contain anything.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variations as you like. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bad. this is looking for all pieces that either include Mike Oldfield or a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bath.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the sequence of entries by pressing the Ctrl key, and then right-click on the entries. the entries will then be marked with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some of the functions of the playlist. on the left you will find the Add to which you can add the playlist items.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, follow the Buttons back and restore, so you can revert or restore any changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the middle of the toolbar, there is a unique, larger analyzer. the refresh rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the Analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button in the toolbar is menu. it opens the same menu as that which you can see in the player window using the right mouse button. over this menu you can set up & Amarok; s configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many more buttons available for the toolbar, for example playback controls and volume control. you can set up the buttons displayed by clicking on the menu and setting up toolbar buttons... Select.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist. it shows the title of the current piece, the number of pieces and the total playtime of all pieces. furthermore, the status for random mode and retrieval can be easily changed by clicking with the mouse twice in the corresponding display area.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. to do so, disable the Status Bar option in the general settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking in the playlist on the menu. using this menu you can reach the settings of & Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1404">A click on this entry will open the Visualization plug-in window. there you can select the visualizations of & Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1405">Behind this entry is a submenu with links to this document and other information about & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1406">The cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover images. you can start them by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser.</seg>
<seg id="1407">The cover management includes a list view of all albums in your collection. you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the artist on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1408">With the View menu you can choose what to display in the cover management. choose from:</seg>
<seg id="1409">The queue management received your big move into & Amarok; 1.3. with this function you have even more control over the playlist. after you have set a piece in the queue, a number appears in the playlist next to the title. this number represents the order in which & Amarok; the pieces will play: 1 is played first, 2 as second, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1410">If you want to add a piece to the queue, select the piece in the playlist and then click +. you can also easily add the pieces to the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist. you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management.</seg>

<seg id="1467">This also allows you to create an image from a CD, which you can then burn sometime later. furthermore, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of the normal copy. you should also prefer cloning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">This also allows you to create a copy of a DVD to another medium. alternatively, you can only create an image of a DVD which you can burn later at some point. furthermore, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of the normal copy. the converting / editing of a DVD with the help of the copy dialog is not yet supported, so the target medium must be large enough to record all (video) data of the source medium in the original form.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Opens the dialog for deleting a CD-RW, so you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD-RW.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Open the dialog for formatting a DVD. with this dialog you can format a DVD + R (W), whereby the contents will be completely deleted. & k3b; lets you choose between writing modes overwriting and incremental.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Burn a previously created CD image. the dialog will prompt you for a * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file as a data source, which can then immediately be burned by pressing the burning button. (Nero * .nrg files are currently not supported yet, but you will need to use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">Burn a previously created DVD image. the dialog will prompt you for a * .iso file as a data source, which can then be burned immediately by pressing the button.</seg>
<seg id="1473">This dialog box will typically appear after reading a DVD in the table of contents, but can also be used alone. it contains information about the read, encoding settings and even possibilities for changing size and cutting black edges.</seg>
<seg id="1474">This information is displayed in the content view and contains the properties of the medium, such as size and title length of the CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Shows a list of toolbars of & k3b; when an entry is enabled, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">If this is enabled, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not enabled, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The folder view contains an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives. if the contents view is checked, their contents will be displayed in the contents view. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with features such as media info, locking and unlock the drive or ejecting the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The content view also allows selecting and dragging files to the project view. the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs if a drive is selected using a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The header is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the headline does not have any real function, it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog box to change keystrokes for & k3b; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part, you can adjust the key signature for this further down.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This will start the k3b; setup assistant. this allows you to set the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs, so you need to enter the password for the system administrator (root) at the start of the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & k3b; here general program settings can be made. almost all functions of & k3b; should work immediately. this dialog is intended for personalising and fine adjustment of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many others & kde; applications also, equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality can, for example, be controlled via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">In order to use the & DCOP functions, you can either use the dcop command line program, or use the somewhat more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the range of functions, so your taste and the type of tasks you assign is crucial.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume you use the dcop command line program. to use the & DCOP functions, you must first make sure & k3b; started. then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; -functions common to all & kde; -program, supported & k3b; mainly two more parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface from & k3b; provides functions such as copyCD, formatted DVD and other functions to generate new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createVideoCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVD Project () DCOPRef createMovixDVD Project () DCOPRef createMovixDVD Project () void copyCd () void BurnCdImage () void BurnCdImage () void BurndvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project using the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project using the # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the K3bProjectinterface listed above and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which can only be applied to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (Qstring name) void addurl (Qstring name, QString Transparent) void addurl (QString path) void renameItem (QString path) void renameItem (QString path, QString sake) void setvolumeID (Qstring id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders, and then add files to the new folders:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; -reader for & kde;. with it, simply audio CD; s can be read out and stored in MP3 or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on hard disk) and by many encoders that encoded these wav files (these encoders need to be installed from the Linux distribution). more encoders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these wav files (usually one per caption) compress into the MP3- oder OGG format or also in other formats like lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, the reading of the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders have to be installed. all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distributions, so it is probably not necessary to compile something yourself. however, if FLAC is not used, its installation is not required either.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format should be used? the chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction about encoder, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia to read out the audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to bypass any copyrighted audio CD; not even the mechanisms of copy protection.</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only once (the setup dialog can be called as often until a suitable configuration has been found), the daily handling for reading a & CD; on the hard disk explains. this leads (hopefully) to the understanding of the lean approach of the user interface that you will often stumble across at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which code programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; collect information from the freedb from the Internet or can work completely without a network, whereby everything is manually recorded.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the commands of the main window. on the page step by step example are more information on how this program is used, as well as screenshots with descriptions of the tabs for the configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Starts the CDDB request of the CD-data according to the setup of request in the CDDB tab. (this can be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the internet must first be established.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Starts reading and - if an encoder is configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup catalog - encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoders, so that the selection can be read with another encoder than the default. it is to be noted that before the encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the File Manager so that an existing file is selected for encoding instead of a full & CD; read out and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notifications (such as protocols, bexes) for program events (such as read out the & CD; quit).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main dialog from & kaudiocreator; with different card flashcards (like encoders, for setting the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, coding and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC, there are others like 'shorten' or 'monkey' that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psycho-acoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but the differences are less important because both encoders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame is still included with most distributions for free, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (at high bitrates) but slightly lower quality compared to OGG at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playthings is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music should also be listened to on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special car stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly support only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems of high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. requires up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. always needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate approx. 11, 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good enough for music of young people, portable devices and auto stereo systems. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you want to have absolutely top quality without regard to file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is manually entered or fetched from the freedb via the Internet is available in the program as a list of parameters. you can hand / used with & kaudiocreator; and the encoding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; add title to keyword (English: tag) when encoding MP3s with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameter from & kaudiocreator; added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= buttoner in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read out the audio CDs that can download information instead of entering the computer. it is to be noted that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note of the translator: that's the author) I am not attorney. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; information without the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be damaged. all information can be obtained anyway with a stroll through a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is active to select a check box (sending an address). for the use of freedb may be used with another (fake) address than the one in the system. in this kind of configuration, it appears that the email address is not used when invoking the data from the server (This can only know the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator, set up to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server is to be used. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit at freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which read program is used to save pieces from the & CD; to save in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more closely, search in the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see that the cdparanoia package must be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this has not yet been done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For saving the read WAV files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. the first opening contains predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (lossless compression for audio data) on the tab to set up the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed by the respective Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also required for the predefined encoders. more information on Kodiers is found in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder, you can obtain more information about its switches by entering a command like lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and read real on it and whether both cdparanoia as well as the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want a copy-protected audio CD; check the cover of the & CD; this won't succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with one step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understand everything, but are still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we'll use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 keywords.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found for example with a search engine, since it is considered as non-totally free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure the directory / usr / share / cd is and that you have write permission on it (eg by trying to copy something inside the console).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic set-up of & kaudiocreator; something that is probably done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each reading & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoders to be used for compression of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) and the resulting sound quality (MBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we are lazy, we share the program with the freedb to use the & CD; download data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will most likely not change them on any output of a & CD; once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the reading program so that it can read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the entries of the device designations for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The tab General Settings. here is not much to do. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything is left as left / inserted as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Select only for incomplete information, so that you will be informed if information on creating keywords (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The CD; Settings. simply select both entries. we are convenient and let the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freedb machine.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the freedb server while reading the & CD; it must be connected to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is easier, a & CD; entry is found, immediately starts reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / file names or tag entries, they can easily be changed. the directory and file name will be changed with Konqueror- &gt; and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, keep in mind: if you want to enter all manually, disable the selection fields and freedb is not used. however, this is more than 620 MB big, consider this twice if this is worthwhile. to use freedb in offline mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following card card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is a freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data the CD should be received? read the section about freedb.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we haven't downloaded the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB Server: please go to freedb.org and look for a mirror server in your vicinity. on this way, the load is distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equally as far as the server is concerned, as many firewalls log the protocol 8880 by default, there may be more luck with the protocol 80, as the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want to send & CD; data to the freedb server. disabling the first check box should suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screen shot. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously available pieces: sorry, there is one reason why more than one is at the same time with just one existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author does not know, therefore simply try yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; discard after reading the last piece: tick this to the & CD; discard at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then the path / folder can be specified in which the WAV files are stored. this can be useful if there is only space on another drive. if the field is not enabled, the files will be created in the private folder. do not forget to make this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything as it is on the screen shot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something has to be flattened to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as already mentioned before, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for limiting the generation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags may also be deleted if necessary.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoded wav files: with a dual core or quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to code more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is it, we just have the basic set up of & kaudiocreator; finished. this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a & CD; used. if you chose the organizational structure of your music cleverly, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section we describe how the process of reading the & CD; the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, was described in the previous section and set up. first, a connection to the internet is built up, since we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freedb is to be retrieved. the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each read & CD; repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not contained in freedb, the screenshots look a bit different from the data collected for a & CD; with successfully fetched data. therefore, you will learn to enter the & CD; data manually instead of retrieving it from the internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Do not try the & CD; this example can be found. it is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not yet been done, the & CD has to be inserted into the drive defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screenshot. this only if the & CD; as an audio CD; could be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen then search in the Questions and Answers section after the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully fetched from the freedb, all titles of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; -key for your & CD; a window is displayed and you can select the database entry that best fits your & CD; matches your opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the Options dialog), you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you have no local database, but fetch the data from the internet, you will need to connect to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD-Editor - Input of the CD-data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Current title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "the artist no longer has to be entered in the" "" "Current title" "" "input field unless you have a compilation of various artists for each piece." ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower commentary box can be used for individual comments per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments that are common to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you can not only be satisfied with the artist and album name (e.g. whether all words start with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary area. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudiocreator.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later at any time with the Tag Editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders or file formats. see the help of the encoder to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the outgoing CD; in this example, this is not important since we don't provide the & CD; data anyway. for more information, go to freedb.org's website and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK', return to the main window. just click on the line with the second one.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The CD editor window appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we have recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD; enter.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Warning: this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed above the piece list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark before each line of a piece. only the titles that are so marked will be read out. a simple click on the line will turn on the selection of the piece. make sure that all pieces are selected, or press the All pieces at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">If you click on the button selection to start reading the selection process, this window will appear to confirm. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the Rider orders to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly below the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to check the orders. the first piece is just read on the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">You will see this error message when trying to work with a code that you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully encoded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we entered here in the example. did you check if you have write access to the temporary files and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3. thus, read and code parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found any configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding. in performance-weak machines, the result is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read while another piece is encoded and a third job is in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is encoded, a small window with a message is displayed for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the code of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">& kaudiocreator; today, you can download CVS as part of the kdemultimedia package. however, if you are familiar with CVS, you can download from there an anonymous copy. most distributions, however, already contain a pre-compiled package, since & kaudiocreator. install the kdemultimedia package from your distribution. if you are reading this, you probably have already done it...</seg>
<seg id="1609">This section is aimed at people compiled from source files, and not intended for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running, then the following is correct for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls out many different programs has many variations of settings. it's best to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings. it shows screenshots of the different tab card settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, still reading? even if only the help menu was clicked after the first start of the program without any indication of how to proceed from this somehow empty screen (especially if there is no audio CD; in the drive), or from the unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it all about? who reads this, probably already started the program. it should look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no e-mail. the author cannot maintain this manual. it is intended as the first version for a manual to & kaudiocreator; let it do. at least after contacting with the author. and if you read this, he has left this section and therefore agrees to this proposal.</seg>
<seg id="1615">Strange if you managed to get the source file from the & kde; SVN, then you don't need these information, but...</seg>
<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and karaoke player of & kde; besides others, with real-time graphics and karaoke live highlighting of texts, he also has some features that other & UNIX; -MIDI players do not have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so it should work on all systems with OSS and & kde; support. & kmid; also supports the Linux; Ultrasound project driver that is needed for GUS cards. Alsa is included as soon as it supports a sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; displays the song text on the screen with changing color, making it easy to follow the track.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & Drop to drag & drop to drag & drop any MIDI file from one & konqueror; -Windows to kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files (song events or text events). kmid will automatically determine the procedure used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Session Support. when you finish & kde; when playing a song, kmid will start again with the same song next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog, with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; -windows into the & knot; window. this also works with multiple songs simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the button Play in the toolbar, select the play sequences from the menu item or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts when you draw it to the & kmid; (with multiple pieces they will be added to a collection and then played successively.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; play a piece, you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and moving back and forth with the controller.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click the arrows to the left and right of the speed display and thus change the playing speed. to get back the original tempo, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a play is played, a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the pause button or selecting the menu item Pause in the menu item, thus interrupts playback. press the space bar while no play is played, start & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be saved in two ways in a piece of music. some pieces use text, others use lyrics and others do both. some pieces do not have a text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set which events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined which a song is used, so that you do not have to manually adjust the automatic text selection. however, if you select the Auto Texts option in the Settings menu, you will still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to specify a type of event type, select the entries of text events or song events from the Settings menu. the same function also has the 1 and 2 buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI Files that you summarize. these are played back in series. in this section you will learn how to use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find it in the menu collection under the item Organize.... Click here on New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then specifying the name for the new collection. at the beginning, this collection will contain the same songs as the original ones.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the desired amount in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection contains all the songs you don't want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When you leave the application, this collection is not stored. remember that when you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, you must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the Add button. it appears in turn the file dialog, with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the automatic addition to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When Automatic add to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If Automatically add to the collection is not checked, the temporary collection is activated and emptied when opening a piece. this collection will then be added to the still opened items.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the series from the submenu collection sequence of the menu collections, the songs will be played in the order as they have been added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the drop-down list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To continue a song, select the Next song button, the next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song back, select the Previous Model button, the previous item from the menu item or press the arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to delete and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter, since it is not saved when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers which are not general-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map translates general-MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the Change patch to Bright Piano type into events of the Change Herpatch to Trumpet type and thus always makes a trumpet sound if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one soundcard, you do not need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM equipment and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI maps, so you have to edit the appropriate file by hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that stores all required transformations for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may appear only once except the Keymap section which may appear as often as desired. however, the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define Keymap "Name of Keymap"... END Define Keymap "Another Keymap..." END Define CHANNELIF... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is used to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an email so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section you specify how the patches of General MIDI are mapped to your specific keyboard. general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the code sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to place all the sounds of this instrument to sound with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported for example (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60) which sounds similar to a gun. to do this, enter the following in the PATCHMAP:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 (gun shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that this refers to the term drum patch of the patch, where each sound is a different percussion instrument (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the always same drum (as some keyboards have).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The Keymap section is used to specify how sounds are displayed on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as is the presence. you must create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several maps for each channel and each instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">First of all, the keymaps are used to make sounds on the percussions-channel. take a look as an example of the provided maps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channel, just make it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need 16 or 9 channels).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is mapped to the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the keyword is used with the name name for that channel. if you use the ForcePatch Option, all events that attempt to change the patch on this channel will be ignored. in this case patch x will always be used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">For example, ForcePatch can be useful to always use the percussions-patch on the percussions-channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio indicates in which ratio pitch-benefit events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch-benefit event with the value n, it is converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used so that no decimal commas are in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM pretends that a keyboard, which receives a pitch-benefit event with the value 4096, should play a tone higher. unfortunately, some keyboards try to play two tones up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you'll have to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the dialog MIDI Settings. this can be found in the Settings menu, MIDI Settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a complete range of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you can see which sounds are currently being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button lights no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has two different views (up to now) to display the played sounds. in the Settings menu, select Settings at the Settings menu: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so, for example, if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it. to change the tempo, use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, etc., so that the same MIDI file can result in very different results on two different devices, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anybody to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; this happens because & kmid; compiled without AWE support. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's home page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I have no desire to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Disagree, therefore supports & kmid; drag & drop. just open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all the files, and drag them to the & kmid; -windows.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Previously, enable automatic addition to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key to the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the standard tempo you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kde; -Desktop one & konqueror; window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or attached (if I want to play a karaoke file), I just need to change to the & konqueror; -windows and drag the desired file to the window by & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you just want to listen to a file, without adding them to a collection, turn off the automatic addition to the collection, and the new one; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first you just want to play the first file. so, set the setting Automatic add to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly that one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, it encourages me to write to & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; I studied mathematics at the University of Maacute; Malaga. at the moment I'm in the third year, so I don't have much free time for my hobbies, but I'm trying to take a bit of time. as hobbies I have programming, collecting MIDI files, making music and demonstrating phrases.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you just want to make me happy, write me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrais.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make me a joy when you send me a postcard from your place of residence or a MIDI- / Karaoke file from a local group. if you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file, please enumerate (if you want).</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; written entirely in my spare time and won't get any money for it. I would like to point out that I only use it because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch at AWE cards was too high.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks also applies to Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the AWE support, Ignacio Garcia for testing the AWE support, Has Petter Bieker, Ola Sigurdson, Peter Gritsch, Peter-Paul Witta, Thorsten Westheider, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, an error message or just a supportive e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the net, which give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition, it can be found on its homepage, which is located under http: / / www.arrais.es / ~ rlarrosa / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, search for information and view pictures. you will also find there links to pages with other karaoke songs, & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, since the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use an FM radio device or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you must compile and compile with the MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL parameter. it then runs as if you have a sound card, except that you can of course not hear any music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & kde; -mailing lists or send an error message right to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple interface for MPlayer, Phono and ffmpeg. the program is used to play video files supported by MPlayer or Phonon supported formats, as well as for playing DVD s, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname; was not yet finished than & kde; installed on this machine.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help please check the site The KDE website on new versions, or send the question to The & kde; user Mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is the window with the playlist. and finally, there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred connections under the bookmark menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course you can add groups to groups in order to obtain an additional hierarchy level. if you select an entry, his group and all his subgroups will be copied to the current category and the playback will start with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current play ', TV and permanent playlists can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files. of course you can only do this if & KMPlayer; not running. to do so, simply click on a name of a category, then select from the View menu and next edit mode. by clicking a subgroup, only the XML content of this part will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to select the same with playlist from the menu and select either the editing mode or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the editing mode leaves or another group is selected without equal to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer, some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation while starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc and changing [General Options] No Intro = 0 above option to '1'. if the option is not available, it can be inserted easily.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation while starting needs not to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. this would be annoying in the end animation but the user can therefore finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be the viewing of a favorite picture: & lt; & lt; img dur = "incurrent" src = "file: / / / home / Koos / mum.gif" fit = "meet" / etc; & lt; / swillies; In the directory test / some examples of SMIL are supported by & KMPlayer; supported.</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the & KMPlayer configuration dialog; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the intermediate storage size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'Console' in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here the output of mplayer is visible.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this playback device in the & KMPlayer configuration dialog; everything needs to be configured by manually editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc, just like setting up the backend by mimetype. here is an example of how a flash is played with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & KMPlayer; it can even include the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">For the & KMPlayer; 'flash' in HTML pages can play, the & KMPlayer; module as service provider for the mime type application / x-shockwave flash in the setup dialog file Zubutions of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; is in a console application to start and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library. if there are no errors, the backend output is within & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu to check).</seg>
<seg id="1726">To ensure that a given backend is always taken for a specific mime type (of course only if this is also determined), this must be done by manually changing the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc file. for example, Phonon is supposed to play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play from TV cards, either by MPlayer or XVideo (this requires kxvplayer). before TV can be digested, the device to be used and the TV channels need to be configured. for this purpose, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog in the Settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port should be detected. there should be found ports, one of which is selected. the correct name probably has a dvb included in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of KMPlayer can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the videoforlinux extension for the XFree86 server must be supported in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config)</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internal are used by KMPlayer for the sources different names. at the time of creating this documentation, this dvdnavsource, dvdsource, exitsource, introsource, pipesource, tvscanners, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource and vdrsource.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Are there any instructions on how to make my CDROM drive quieter when I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command HDPARM -E 8 / dev / cdrom is to run as user root after the device is inserted. it is absolutely certain that / dev / cdrom drives on the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine only starts slowly, why does every time my CPU needs to be checked for its performance?</seg>
<seg id="1734">Note: the answer is overhauled. kxineplayer automatically needs the last saved value, only the first time xine will check the CPU.</seg>

<seg id="1748">& Kile; is an integrated & latex; environment for the & kde; -Desktop. & Kile; offers the possibility to use all & latex; functions in a graphical interface and within this easy, immediate and customized access to all & latex; furthermore, the easy-to-use wizard, the & latex; reference and powerful project management.</seg>
<seg id="1749">To learn more about & Posters; and to experience its possibilities, the manual to Kate should be used. users of & Kile; can start working there directly by reading the chapter work with the editor of & kate.</seg>
<seg id="1750">For & latex; is the correct language: Lay-TECH. while the original & tex; difficult to use, can also use a layman (engl. lay) & latex; macros. a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it descends from the surname of Leslie La mport.</seg>
<seg id="1751">While here only a good overview of latex; given, it is not the ultimate book about it. in order to be able to master properly, good books should be used e.g. H. Kopka / P. W. Daly, A Guide to & latex;: document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The introduction contains at least the command\\ documentclass, the body begins with the command\\ begin {document} and must be closed again with the command\\ end {document} and must be closed again with the command\\ end {document} and must be closed again.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The Quick Start Wizard of & Kile; is an useful feature for fast creation of a document in & Kile;. the selection of the wizard (menu) offers some options for creating the document. you can also make some settings related to the document.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document classes: this describes the type of document to be created: article (article), book [book], report [scrartcl], report (DIN) [scrdeprt], book (DIN), film [Prosper] or user defined.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Encoding: this is used to set the character encoding. modern systems use UTF-8 encoding as standard. best of all should be UTF-8X (for the correct processing of the & latex; documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most commonly used supplementary packages for & latex; they only have to be selected in the check box.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), book (DIN), letter (DIN), letter (DIN): the document classes of Koma-Script (to comply with German DIN regulations). they should always be used when creating German texts.</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users don't have to worry about this. it is just a brief description of the functions and further information about this are given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& Kile; offers - as well as other source text editors - highlighting the used commands, settings and elements (as well as the inappropriate). by & Kile; if you see larger areas of a green text on the screen, it is with great probability that some mathematical environment is not closed.</seg>
<seg id="1760">When entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) from & Kile; automatically generates a blank line (for entering the text) and the corresponding line for closing the command (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be deactivated in the Settings box... LaTeX commands are disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually subdivided into some elements. & latex; allows subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the most common and subcategory the lowest element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful if a DVI file is created. once a DVI file is created, jumps & Kile; by a click with the middle mouse button in DVI; viewer to the appropriate line in & latex; source.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI file contains a description of the formatted document and other information such as the font and is next to PDF the standard output type of & tex; or & latex; there are many tools for viewing, converting and printing of DVI; files for various systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the DVI file, the elements of the DVI file are drawn with the editor and as soon as an element is clicked into the DVI file; the default search is the exact opposite of it. as soon as on a section in the & latex; source text is clicked, the corresponding section is jumped into the DVI; viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document, work with other embedded .tex files will be simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set on project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick-construction: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result will be displayed automatically (if there are no errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File surveillance: in this mode, the DVI file is fed to the outside and there is no call by & Okular; after quick construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the edit toolbar, you should notice the three large selection fields. the selection boxes have been developed for quick insertion of joint elements into the document. the first selection field is for quick classification of the document into parts, chapters, sections,...</seg>
<seg id="1770">The Other is for inserting items such as keywords, knots or references. the options available include:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command, a term for a section, an image or a different element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: used for reference to a specified term (choice of a selection field possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote, a selection list will be shown with literary entries. at & bibtex; this only works if the file is committed to a project. the author has good experience with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; -files can also be written in & Kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-down box named GrÃ ¶ Ã e is used for determining the size of the lettering. it is possible to specify the lettering for the main text, the joints, etc. the following characters are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & Kile, two choices are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings. 2. the document can be written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets after the command\\ documentclass contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] defines the font. if the font is not specified at the beginning, this can also be done in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">As soon as the above source code example has been typed, the & latex needs to be compiled; the easiest way to do this is to use the Menus Construction or button fast construction.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved before compiling. & Kile; it automatically retrieves the storage.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compiling of the document fails, it should be searched for errors in logging. when using quick construction, it should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font 12 is created and only a few places should have another font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} then allows the change of the lettering in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are considered only within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no reduction (number) for the changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to obtain the readability and user-friendliness of the document. for example, certain fonts, liposure, italics pressure, subtitles, etc. can be added. these commands either end with the\\ end command or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the italics pressure and is valid until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in one sentence can be represented recursively with\\ emph {word} italic.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ begin {ratio} and ends with\\ end {ratio}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background to write the source text with the & latex; -markup language is represented, a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & Kile is now followed.</seg>
<seg id="1786">As soon as a bit of text is entered in the wizard, a few adjustments for the better readability of the document should be made. for this, mind. a quote, a few places in the bold and cursive print and a poem can be applied to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, it can be returned to the editor by an editor-View or Ctrl-E (in the internal viewer). an external viewer has to close its window.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI file has been created, the document can be printed out or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. just try and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent file format (English D e V ice I nRNA). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printer, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI file, the same steps as for the creation of the document are necessary (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed by file printing (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar permits the conversion of the DVI file into other formats. as soon as the DVI file was created from the & latex; source code was created, converting into desired other formats can begin using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The submission search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; provides a corresponding setting for all & latex; -bindings. for this you just have to set up Modern under Settings box... Tools can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to select the default search, the mouse cursor has to be positioned in a line of the source text and then click on default search. the jump to the appropriate place in DVI; -viewer is then inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & Okular; is opened with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI; document the corresponding & latex; Document from & Kile; in & Okular; in & Okular; in & Okular; as text editor.</seg>
<seg id="1796">If there is no error in using the Quick-construction of the & DVI file, there may be an error. if there is an error, this will be shown in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file invokes the source code error source. in the editor, the buttons Previous LaTeX errors and NÃ ¤tster LaTeX errors can be used between the errors. in order to view the faulty row, the error in the Logging must be clicked and & Kile; jumps to the defective line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">As soon as the corresponding button is clicked in the toolbar, a window appears to select the template to be used for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting a blank document, a document can either be rewritten from scratch or the wizard can be used to quickly create a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Ugly users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be stored in & Kile; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or created a new file. & Kile; can create a new template by using an existing document and selecting file template from document...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template by file New, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings box... Settings can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entering the document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps must be executed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, you can then select your own template instead of the default.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files are created. if a simple way to create a template, it should be searched for on the Internet and the steps described below should be executed.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Posters; uses & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the ability to read and produce from many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for & Posters; can be made directly from & Kile in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & posters; and to experience its capabilities, the manual to Kate should be used. users of & Kile; can start working there directly by reading the chapter work with the editor of & kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very practical & latex; command reference, which can be invoked through the MenÃ ¼ help LaTeX reference. it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be used in & latex; and its syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with the Ctrl key to select the & tex; this means that in this way, clicking on\\ par\\\\\ bigskip is only\\ par.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with the left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Using the arrow keys with a pressed Shift key, parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to browse the most different types of source code and highlight these. for example, the latex is different from normal text and mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can add additional diving marks within the text. these are an own type of bookmark within the text. the menu items Edit jumping brands or the corresponding keys allow the leap to the next or last jump mark. thereby, this jump-mark is also highlighted, so that at the first input of a character it is automatically deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like & Kile; although & kate; already excellent features, have been added in & Kile; important functions for writing a & latex; source code always needs many environments and groups, and therefore supports & Kile; special commands for their selection.</seg>
<seg id="1817">Heals a complete paragraph (group of lines containing an empty line on both sides). this added value does not include a text with continuous lines (as in other text editors). this expanded meaning includes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="1818">The word is selected from the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning, since this command also contains & latex; commands with a rinse layer (\\) and an additional star (*) will be selected at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Delete key. & Posters; offers the key Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & Kile; offers with its own commands for a faster option.</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & Kile; is included in the description to edit select heel.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been made clear that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & Kile; for further orders under the working environment for a possible simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command will jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly before the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command moves to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is in front of or inside the\\ begin {environment}, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested ambient commands, the overview can be quickly lost. this command then closes the recently opened environment so that the nested surrounding structure is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also provides special commands for the & latex; groups that are determined by parentheses {...}. under Edit TeX group are a few important commands that correspond to those from working environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command will jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command moves to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the curling clasp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is in front of or behind the curly clasp of a & tex; group #, jumps to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many nested braided parentheses, the overview can be quickly lost. this command then closes the recently opened group, so that the nested structure of the & tex; -groups is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple suits are used as gasses. for the purposeful implementation is used in & Kile; the sign is used for two simple touch signs. also for terminating the appropriation, the sign is used. & Kile; knows this case and performs two closing notes for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic entry of the double request characters can be set up under Settings box... LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">You can also use foreign-specific settings (e.g. naurus or French) and therewith German or French quotes. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When shifting from Shift; Enter key & Kile; an intelligent line break. if the current position is located within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & Kile; not just a line break, but at the same time the\\ item command.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Close the current line with\\\\ with an end-to-end line break.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & Kile; is smart enough to support pre-set & latex; - or user-defined environments. these can be added under Settings Kile; set up... LaTeX to be added.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to classify the columns in spreadsheets and thereby all Et characters (amp;) among each other. & Kile; tries to achieve this. although this tab is not possible, for & Kile; some intermediate space for the columns position of the current tab.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & kate; already provides a good source code completion, this has been added in & Kile; to implement special commands (mostly for & latex;). three of these modes work for automatic completion. all these modes can be set for different modes of work under Settings Kile... quit.</seg>
<seg id="1839">At the beginning a new environment by the command\\ begin {environment} becomes & Kile; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} to an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the back key, the last letter of the input is removed and possible, therefore, the complete list can be grasped. on the other hand, the list can also be reduced by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. the descriptions are naturally removed when selecting a command. alternatively, jump marks can be found, so that a simple jump to these positions can be possible using the jump brand NÃ ¤chste jumping brand and the desired parameters can then be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings Kile; set up... box; complete settings can be made to these lists. there may be different wiper lists for & TEX; - and & latex; commands as well as wipers of the general language used.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not useful for the execution of environments. there are always a few letters with\\ begin to be entered and the call to full support mode will result in a large list of environment commands. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & Kile; a special mode for complete destruction of environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When the Alt + Shift key Alt + Shift key Alt + Shift key, the command to open the environment is automatically inserted and it appears\\ begin. afterwards, the ambient temperature can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input key.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this has been done, the environment will be closed automatically. once & Kile; realize that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command will be filed.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings Kile; set up... box; complete settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the WÃ ¶ rterliste des verquit mode for & tex; - and & latex; commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Kile; supports custom lists of cuts that are immediately replaced by a string of strings. the lists can be set up under Settings box... boxes can be executed. for example, the file example.cwl, in which the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is entered and the word 'fullfilled mode' via the menu dialog, or the key Ctrl + Alt spacebar, the character L will be replaced by the\\ LaTeX string.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large watchers are not helpful for automatic completion. however, it has been noted that many guards are written more than once in a document. thus, & Kile; the completion for all already written documents.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the Settings box... box can be turned off. here, the threshold for the display of the completion can also be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1851">The executable files can be installed in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Kile / complete / mode / the PersÃ ¶ nlichen Home folder. mode stands for abbreviation (abbreviation), dictionary (WÃ ¶ rterbuch) or tex.</seg>

<seg id="1853">PS files are not as known as PDF files, but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders of pages. if the PDF output is used, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; tools and then converted with ps2pdf into a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">To view the result of the work, the source code must be compiled. all the construction tools are grouped in the MenÃ ¼ s Creating compiling, converting and creating view.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source text for viewer like & eyepiece; or the further conversion can be used the keyboard shortcut Alt; 2. afterwards, the DVI file can be viewed in the standard viewer using Alt; 3, by Alt; 4 the DVI file is converted into a PS file and by Alt; 5 the PS file can be viewed.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the quick-build command, a viewer is normally called after compilation. if no built-in viewer is used, a new window will be opened each time.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project will be launched on the New Project project. the following information is queried for the project:</seg>

<seg id="1920">As I said before, anyone who has worked at the & kde; documentation has already worked, knows how helpful this application is. and with & quantaplus, there is now a great graphical interface for it.</seg>
<seg id="1921">If the opened file is index.docbook then simply let the current work folder be selected. if not, select the current working folder and enter the folder where index.docbook is to be found.</seg>

<seg id="1929">The plug-ins, which & quantaplus; invite, have with & quantaplus; even possibly little to do. this makes the plug-in system very powerful. you can immediately benefit from the additional functionality and don't have to wait until someone uses the device in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="1930">To install a plug-in or a part, we start with the Edit menu. this opens the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows you to manage all included plugins and add new ones. we describe each & GUI; element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plugins without a location used & quantaplus; this path to search the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often work on a project several persons in a sort of hierarchical relationship to each other. & quantaplus; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the nickname of the user and is used for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have several roles in the project, such as team leaders and sub-project leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can select from the list of team members who he is. this happens by searching the team member from the list and pressing the Setze button. the currently selected member (their identification) appears to be bold after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and setting of your own identity are important with regard to news and notes. see for more information on comments.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to an overview of the team, there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team: an event can be created for information to the team leaders when something specific happens. see for further information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project. an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project, so that later can be seen how much someone worked on it or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that launches a file into CVS, as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the page Configuration of the Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog, events can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email is sent to the addressee selected in the recipient list. the addressee can be a team or sub-project manager. see how to set up such a ladder.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Remarks are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by the following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">Insert notes is simple. either the comment entry can be selected from the Editor context menu or the @ annotation keyword can be entered in a comment area followed by annotation text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Comments can be sent to a specific member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), where nickname is the nickname of the team member, role in the project consists of the following possibilities: team Leader Subproject Manager According to the enrichment and sub-project managers, the corresponding area or sub-project names should be given as in the following examples below.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roles names are case-sensitive, but spaces around the brackets and the: make the note invalid.</seg>
<seg id="1946">& quantaplus; is a development environment for scripting and formatting languages, which is DTD-agnostic and supports web-based formatting and scripting languages.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The settings are accessible via the Settings menu. here, only about & quantaplus; -specific settings are treated, a short description for the others can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The settings can be set up using Settings Quanta... This dialog covers some pages that are dealt one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behaviour of & quantaplus; with respect to tags including car completion, it can be changed. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Big / lowercase of tags: big / lowercase of automatically inserted tags. normal size / lowercase means the tags are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tag XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Big / lowercase of attributes: large / lowercase of automatically inserted attributes. normal size / lowercase means the attributes are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tag XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically include: if checked, it is inserted for tags, for which the closing day is optional, this immediately after the & gt; inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Not include optional tags: as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Update start and end tag automatically: if enabled, the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic setting of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters to the corresponding encoding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for the detection of different types of files. the default settings can be restored using the Standard button.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the encoding of newly created files or in other ways than with file open opened files (where the encoding of the file can be skipped), but this setting will be ejected by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not detected. however, this setting is emitted by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates regular backup copies, so that in case of a power failure or crash when the program is started, the document can be recovered from this backup. this is not the same as saving the file. also for unsaved documents, a backup is created regularly, according to the set time.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in your own view (or the documentation in a tab), making it possible to view the documentation, preview and source code at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Reset the window settings to the default when the next start is useful when the user interface has been changed by modifying the MDI modes and docking / appending views. it corresponds to the --resetlayout command line parameters.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning message area is used for controlling the possibility to disable the display of warnings by checking out any longer.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place to change the behavior of & VPL; it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the PL- and the source-view in shared mode.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree, which represents the representation of the parser nodes in the document, can be adjusted in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the field of mouse click on the structure tree, the following action is possible, which can be changed by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the structural-tree settings area, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the update frequency of the tree when editing and how deep is to be opened automatically when changing the structure tree. empty nodes are empty areas in the text, while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Shortcuts are divided into groups, each can be valid for several & DTEP; s. this means there can be a valid group for PHP, in which the ifoul shortcut means something different than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Here the plug-ins can be managed. plugins are part-applications of third side, which can be reused by any part-capable application, the most known & konqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin, if it is not at a standarder like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plugin at the start, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">"" "load component in" "" "read-only" "" "mode: check if the plug-in refuses to load. only read-only parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected." ""</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plugin: if this is enabled, then testet & quantaplus; if the entered information is correct. select to save the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, troubleshooting was completely new developed. support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger was set, as well as support for the DBG debugger. instead, a debugger plug-in concept was implemented that allows different implementations via plug-ins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plugin is available, support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; inserts.</seg>
<seg id="1975">Using the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plug-in in the project settings. with the Options button next to the Debugger Plugin select field, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed. normally appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all stops, with line numbers and conditions are listed. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view showing the output (as shown in HTML) of the debugger. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, all or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to debugger, if necessary, is made, or it shares the plugin with to listen to Debugger's demands. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened, which uses a debugger, so that normally it does not have to pay attention to it.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to debugging session Starts the session. closes the connection to debugger or stops listening to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends an HTTP request to the server for a debug request. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is shown in the debugger output view.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and to send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, execution will continue. if the script is started, the script will start with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without having to send information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, execution continues. if it happens before a request is made, execution starts as soon as a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger executes the next instruction in the script without entering the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger executes the next instruction in the script, and if possible in functions and include, it is corrected.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs debugger to skip the statement and go to the next as if there is no current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog in which a variable or an expression can be entered, which should be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">This dialog can be used to enter a variable or set a new value to a variable.</seg>
<seg id="1991">& kxsl; is a work of Keith Isdale as well as this part of the documentation. & kxsl; is a & kde; front end and a part of xsldbg that they can find on http: / / xsldbg.sf.net with many more works of Keith.</seg>
<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how you can customize & quantaplus; adapt to your needs and how you can help & quantaplus; help to get better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type Editing Packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; to give support for markup- and scripting languages as well as & CSS; they enable & quantaplus; their simplicity and flexibility makes from & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages or & CSS; s & DTEP; s consists of two parts, the tag directory and the toolbars. tag files are handy, symbolic buttons of image buttons (above the editing window), which insert text and instructions faster into a document than a user ever could.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or created automatically from an existing DTD. see for details on conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are to be created, then the file descriptionrc; and also tool bars. in short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and contents of the properties dialog, the & quantaplus; for the tag. the file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. tool bars allow a quick insertion of tags in a document without the risk of a typist.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag files are nothing but folders. they contain only file descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag files bear the name of the description language and version, so available. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the tag XML and declares whether it is necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only happen once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains as only element type about itself otherwise nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when used & lt; attr &gt; an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only valid for the day type class. the name of the base class for this class. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Valid only for type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has a common attribute group and attributes within that tag can be added to every other day. (family 1 only)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is defined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">This element can only appear once for each attribute. it sets the name and type of the attribute. additionally, there are other tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed & etc; This is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source code used for filling the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; will be used to achieve the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus; is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a interface and a method name. the arguments passed to the method. can be empty or% tagname%, this means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container day that groups the elements of a list. it can happen only once for an attribute description. it is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Defines the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements which may appear within the tag to be defined. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that end a tag. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with a & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces affect nothing, but watch & & & lt; Notes. these should be replaced by & amp; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, & lt; text &gt; will not cause any breakage, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is to start up in the & quantaplus; Windows to start and check TagXML. another dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available yet. currently the check is done only when loading the TagXML files in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following an example of a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">The following is an example of a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file a & PHP; overload function is described. the filename of this TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt; tag name = "function" returnType = "void" &gt; & lt; attr name = "class _ name" type = "option" / &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The file descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor to be edited via DTD editing DTD settings. thus, diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = turn 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with Settings Actions... click New Action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The key shortcut assigned to this action. by clicking the Custom Button a shortcut can be assigned; with Keiner the current shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the defined settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not restricted) that change the document or use as input (or parts of the document) can be started. examples from & quantaplus; even are the quick start dialog or the various See in... actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First you have to specify the name of the script and the interpreter. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. In this way: $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replaced the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file: / from the document name is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with PID of the current & quantaplus; process. if by & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text will be added to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantaplus, from the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods above, a script can be input from & quantaplus; in the input field input can be specified, which is to be sent to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is normally only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be redirected. there are two types output: normal output, written to the default output; error messages that are to occur with the output written to the default output, by setting the value of the selection field output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary for each group to create their own toolbar. in the given case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the markup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all the required fields and add them to the appropriate tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the tag has attributes and you plan their use, enable dialog "Edit Day" if available so that entry is possible when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let us replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that represents the action better, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the & KMenu;, Graphics Other Programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size other.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the day start, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually considered to be los, starte, further interpreted), or should at least be signaled to a message to the user that clicking on this symbol will be inserted; startled; -tag is inserted in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it has to be connected to the action. this is done via the menu with Settings Actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. in addition to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags, if there are any, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; -Functions to the toolbar or it should be shared for a better overview by some separators into several groups. open the toolbar and set dialog using Settings tool bar. make sure that the required toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">After selecting the element that is to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to have a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how Trenner supports grouping. someone who doesn't know my toolbar could believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by using all symbols to make sure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">After New eXML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust its file descriptionrc; so that its toolbar (s) will be loaded (s) when a file is opened by the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language that you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; repository if someone has already done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you have to look for an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file. we leave the first part to you, the second we will handle here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top element = Sec2.1.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.1.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.1.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.1.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.1.html Sec2.1 = Sec2.1.html Sec2.1 = Sec2.html tag 3 = tag 3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see now in the & PHP; documentation such a thing:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html Getting Started = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # of Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is sub-folders in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the depth of the box (except through reason) mdash; but try it for yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder will be shown!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing, but watch & & & lt; Notes. they should be replaced by & amp; & & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resources files will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the range of docrc file used to design context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; scripts, the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (Context List) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of context elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (just as you specified it in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation has been used to the & quantaplus; community. you will not be rich, but be proud to have collaborated with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the failed resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or otherwise. at various locations, there is an Email-Send menu item, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with e-mail, tool bar toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded to our main archive, from where all the others & quantaplus; users can download them. the contributions are checked and only made available if our team needs them as correct and useful for publication. in order to make a proper contribution, the source of the resources is guaranteed, for both our team and for the future users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading you are asked for their passphrase for their private gpg key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event you have several keys, you can choose one. in the dialog New Resources you have to fill in the input fields (URL preview can remain empty) and click OK to start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP) from the toolbar, upload tool bar toolbar, and started in the context menu of files and folders in the template and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, examines & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing. in case of problems it warns and it can then be aborted. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the indication of the resource of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML-languages currently not supported by & quantaplus; however, the creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tagXML format. there is the easiest way to automatically convert a DTD into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD loading and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which should be used. afterwards the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; will be written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype definition line: the string that appears in! Doctype Tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine setting of DTEP after conversion: if enabled, brings & quantaplus; after converting the file descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. to understand them and to get full benefit from & quantaplus, you must first familiarize yourself with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to explain exactly these concepts without understanding their understanding & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus, the workspace is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone named & quantaplus; from tool bars to actions, all that is marked as global is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; this enables the group of administrators to secure different tool bars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which then are available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific samples and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a particular project. this can be anything from & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply said, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which empowers the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the tree views, the index tabs with information and the toolbar. please check in, and for more information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, like closing, reloading, deleting or uploading the document, jumping to a bookmark or executing CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the Editor area leads to another context menu concerning the edited document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / paste / paste), editing the tag under the mouse cursor, or opening the file, when the string is called a file under the mouse cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editor window are the tool bars of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as a standard for which a set of tool bars is shown. in the course of the further expansion of & quantaplus, the tool bars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbar buttons is really easy. if you want to insert a single tag, e.g. & lt; insert in your document, then click on the icon that represents the tag. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (like anchor), you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The site views (QIT;) allow for information on & quantaplus; to navigate, open and strip them. in the presentation with file managers are available for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click. actions such as addition, removal, uploading or deletion of files from the storage medium can be performed with the displayed context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: images, program parts, a whole website, etc. all options are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used. global templates are always available, local templates are available only for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripting languages. clicking with the left mouse button allows you to access the available information to a script. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can access the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is set in the document to the position of the element. by right-clicking an element, a list of commands will open in relation to navigation and refresher of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. with it, many can change attributes and namespaces. the application system aligned to the content allows the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'Documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be added, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two tabs at the bottom of the window that can be accessed using useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab shows information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to the DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the markup of the current document. & quantaplus; -scripts that are executed give all error messages (if any) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbar buttons are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command. the toolbar's chocolate side is the ability to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a tool bar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as compressed Tar archive via & kmail;. if you receive a tool bar in an email, you can backup and load them in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2104">For this, autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and do not run here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that there is no older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH before its bin folder. the same goes for & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE interface. & quantaplus; has been optimised for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML; editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus? well, this would make him the most powerful web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer on pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML, then & quantaplus; for this the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be held that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole & kde; developer community is based. & quantaplus; follow, in good application of free software, the idea of Why develope what someone else has already developed? thanks to the & kde; -scaffolding is not only possible for users and developers, and quantaplus; thus to expand as they need it for their need.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document interface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-leveled actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is almost any task possible.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">For more details, please help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; enter, or run khelpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; currently being developed and supervised by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list changes each time you open a file that is not on it, and the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. check the section on Templates. if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts when inserting from clipboard there contained special characters to & HTML; description, so that they are displayed correctly and cannot be misunderstood by the browser as formatting instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard in & URL; description which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. primarily used to insert & URL; s inserted into the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Enables selection of block selection. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; -script releases error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. that's the window where you can see the display of script actions and debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Switch off and turn on the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter will be activated as soon as you change to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Shows the symbol column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries previous or next depending on the position of the cursors in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped by the file name of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard disk. & quantaplus; -projects are stored with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. that allows you to copy graphics files to your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Upload the files in your project to the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; whether you have downloaded further input / output modules (KIO Slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, like & quantaplus; manages the project. in chapter & quantaplus; -projects you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Downloads a project tool bar. these are stored in project files / toolbars and are only in this menu when you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or Project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this only creates the name. actions must be saved by setting actions... Toolbars will be stored on toolbar toolbar, or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the viewing area. it doesn't delete it from the disk. if you haven't saved the toolbar, you'll be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team so that the toolbar is available in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows you to upload tool bars to the main server, where everyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load a & DTD; that made you or someone else and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Loading / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it is useful if the entities from the & DTEP; be refreshed without renewing the whole & DTEP; if this is global and does not exist in the global KDE folder, the store fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbar. if the default (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a submenu Standard in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activation or deactivates the intelligent insertion of tags. currently, this only works with (x) HTML DTDs. intelligent joining means that & quantaplus; pasting by tool bar if this day contradicts the rules at this place.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plug-ins are listed under the menu items listed above. click on them. clicking on an activated plugins is deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Selects the syntax highlight mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on the posters; version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Selects the type of line ending identifier. very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop. select Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document by means of the selected & DTD; by means of the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Instant switching between the different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching may sometimes take time or create unpleasant graphics. recommended is the index card mode, which is also the default setting, or the sub-window mode corresponding to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for each open sub-window. selecting an entry will activate the corresponding subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Switches the display of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window on / off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog affect any application using the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Set the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & kate, you will find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears in which you delete entries from the toolbar or which can add and modify the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should generate a help according to the environment of the mouse pointer, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high-quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom, since, for example, the whole directory structure for the rest of the project is automatically completed. all of these paths and author information fields can be set later with Shift; F7 project properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to enter, for example foo. when entering the name, file is filled in automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access, except you edit local data. either a name (hostname.exempl.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol will be used. depending on the remote host setting, an adjustment might be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates for the project are saved. it is a relative path to the project and standard templates. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and toolbars by default. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local filesystem into the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. for server side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Let it be checked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included. if a project is started from scratch, do not hook.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders within the main folder are displayed and you can make an exact selection according to good manners.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the files you want by checking or, by removing the tick, clips out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded from the Project Properties menu in the subwindow profiles or Shift; F7 can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (placeholders possible), which are ignored for project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional options to top, including files listed in .cvsignor, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows you to select the debugger you want. currently, only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger plugin can be set using the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the Profiles sub-window, high-load profiles (see in) can be set, as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by adjusting its own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the team configuration subwindow, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow, you can turn event actions and add, modify or delete these actions. event actions are executed when a pre-defined event occurs, such as backing up a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus; the last project that was opened. this behavior can currently not be influenced.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Open Project... from the Project Properties menu or the Project Open Project from the toolbar. the dialog project will open and allows selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantaplus; is closed, the project file will be saved automatically. you'll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, if & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project tree view gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folder behaves as well, but the entries are missing opening and opening with... in the right-click context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removal of the current profile. if there is only one profile, the button is blinded to prevent removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in memory and forgotten at programing. this option is useful when frequent uploading of files is needed and the rather unsafe password on the disk store option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many high-load profiles can be created and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this does not have to be changed unless the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety threshold, this is either a time-saving function or a risk. use it after your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so it can not be read easily, but everyone with knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and tool bars. there can be many views in a project, that is, a simple exchange of views can load various files and toolbars and replace the recently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved in the Project or Project toolbar, accessible via Settings tool bar project toolbar, opened or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; which one has to do most. this not only helps increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of and quantaplus; to their own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, toolbar elements in & quantaplus; best stackable from the toolbar. the use and addition differ. adding toolbar buttons is being treated at the bottom of the Add toolbar section.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the symbols on it can be set either by context menu (right click on the toolbar), in which with New Action, a New toolbar can be created, other actions can be executed like toolbar, rename tool bar, or toolbar buttons, indicating which actions should be visible on this or other toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, the entries will also be removed and action processed, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings tool bar... and settings can be set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are basically a document skeleton, code snippets and files for linking. & quantaplus; uses templates basically like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move, or link any existing directory into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions that are presented to the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions listed at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not pure text. it can be any file except text, i.e. images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binary templates are usually included in documents using img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be of any text document type. on the basis of these templates new documents can be created. usually, more specialized documents are nested in appropriate subfolders. one makes a simple scaffolding for the purpose and organises work in an appropriate way to be efficient. some examples can be found in the template tree among global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of template is useful if not a new document is to be included in the documents based on a template but the same text area. you can find everything from a comment to a final grade to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis. some examples are found in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for entire websites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently, there are no examples in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure as you like (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and select File As template save As a local template...</seg>
<seg id="2204">As soon as this is done, note that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As template save selection as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can simply be dragged with drag and drop to the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. all file management functions can be used, such as drag and drop or paste over the Konqueror file tree.</seg>
<seg id="2207">In the file tree or in the project files, you can click a folder on the right and select Site template, enter and secure a name for the template. by default, it is backed up in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very goal-oriented approach. you can predefine headers and footers or dynamically link with & PHP; design, insert files or link them to them. in addition, you can keep an eye on some things while using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behaviour of a folder, right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection field with the three types previously described; files, text or templates. this selection is blinded as soon as parental attributes are blocked.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits for everything except the regular folders in the template view. if a root folder is configured so it would basically disable templates in this path unless they would be explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows predefined or reproduced text for templates in this folder. this could be general headers or footers for all templates for a specific project and allows for copying contents templates to a folder with special headers / footers to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, using a context menu (pointing right mouse button), you have a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and pasting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; Editor and VPL; & source editor that can be accessed through the View menu. the first mode replaces the source text editor by the VPL; editor and the second will divide the editor window into two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; -Editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it downloads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor appears. then, you can edit and switch back to the source code editor when necessary, in which the changes made in the VPL; -Editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; -Editor on a document containing & PHP; it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; to edit & PHP; to edit & PHP, the source code editor is still required. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that at the same time the changes are visible both in the source text editor and in the VPL; -Editor, and the cursor in the source text editor and in the VPL; -Editor is activated. pressing F9 activates the active cursor from one window to the other, while maintaining the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization between the VPL; editor and the source text editor can be set using Settings Quanta.... After selecting VPL; you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation: a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website so tools can choose document properties. this allows editing of invisible tags when working with the VPL; editor. this will also be called when a new document with the VPL; -Editor is created. this is used to reduce the Hangar encoding. this allows you to change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click on the list allows to change the content, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword key 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to design the viewing of pages in your browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list. a change over the list is exactly as possible with the meta elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style sheet by pressing the file-open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">It is possible to use the cursor as in a word processor, by moving with the arrows. in rare circumstances, the cursor is peculiar. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deleting by button or removed button.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way across the toolbar, as in the source editor. it is to be noted that inserting tags earlier is not removed, e.g. when an anchor tag, surrounded by text, must be removed any other anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some tool bars such as the table assistant or the Listen directive are disabled. they will later work in & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists must be used toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for the study of style sheets. unlike other style sheets, the search for certain elements is possible and the design of the style sheet can be followed.</seg>

<seg id="2230">Xsldbg determines the complete path from a file name without path input. file names in the same folder as the topmost loaded style template file with relative path to the con xsldbg work folder. for example, a style template file.. / en / xslotted .xsl is possible as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2231">In this command, a partial or complete match is checked with a presage called QNAP or a specified mode name. & eg; template agrees with any QNAME that contains the template template.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & knot 3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated, because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation in many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts when merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me only showed me the changed lines, but I could not see exactly what had changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, any number of other useful functions have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it into one of the comparison windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparisons and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost in a fully-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merging is fully supported. this is useful when two persons work independently of each other in a piece of code and make changes. the merge editor under the differences windows allows resolving conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps when comparing and merging complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in the folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently need to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visibly. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, you can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left. (no more trouble if somebody changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other differs in a line, the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both are different.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but are in different folders, you can make typing easier by using only the filename of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Chdiff3 folder folder 1 folder 2 -o target folder kdiff3 folder 3 folder 3 kdiff3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 -o target folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The Open dialog allows manual typing of file names, selecting a file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. the opening dialog displays your selection and shows it next time. you do not need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of differences with two files is performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">By selecting a folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the matching or merging of folders is initiated. if a file is selected for A, but for B and C a folder, then uses & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merging is enabled, the input field is active for target and can be edited. however, it is not strictly necessary to specify an output file immediately. you can also do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Setup dialog opens a dialog with Settings. here you can specify options before starting the merge / merging.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in open dialog you don't need to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, this would be a relatively big effort. you only need to create two corresponding files, upload them into & kdiff3; then you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can extract nothing from & kdiff3; only dropping text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop text into another program as cut and paste (instead of copy and paste). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window is the Info line. the Info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and line number of the first visible line in the window. (if the path to a file is too long, allow the mouse to rest for a while over the line. then a small auxiliary window will show the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is detected, you can see in the color which file differs. if both files differ, the default color for this is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files. that's in the next section (merging) well.</seg>
<seg id="2306">When differences were found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white signs are not so important, it is useful to only see the relevant changes. (for C / C + + e.g. white signs are only relevant in strings and commentaries, for preprocessor and in few rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line dividing the abstraction column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the line breaks are activated, the line is dotted with broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparison windows) also has an Info line with the output:, the filename and [GeUpdate] if you have edited the result. usually, it contains text by automatic merging, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the Springe buttons to the next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, each difference is also a conflict that has to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group belonging to the row is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. (this will also highlight a jump in the position in the windows, where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible.) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes by automatic merging or manual editing, no more line is left in the group; this is only a placeholder in the event that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source. this text does not appear in the final stored file, nor in a marker that you may copy and paste elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard when you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if the sources ignore or ignore C / C + + comments when selecting the sources, changes in numbers or comments are treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigating is mainly using the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, side up, side, beginning, end, Ctrl-start and Ctrl-end, Siw as you can also use it from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the release window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. with the Insert key, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the Summary columns syncs the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the merge section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons to navigate to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Down / Ctrl-above), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Image Upwards / Ctrl-above) or to the next / previous unsolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the mark to the clipboard, press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). if this is enabled, whatever you mark is automatically copied to the clipboard and the manual copy is omitted. however, be careful with this option because you could accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line endings are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use a carriage return + newline feed\\ r\. KDiff3 does not keep the line ends of the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not using binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the most recently used files will be saved automatically at the end and restored at the next start. (menu Settings - &gt; Kdiff3 set up...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a font with fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, there will be differences in italic script. if the chosen font does not support this display, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be rendered as astert. on these systems, the Preferences knob automatically displays an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is checked, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key. otherwise, a tab character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press enter or return, the return of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is checked, each selection will be automatically copied to the clipboard. the manual copy to the clipboard is then omitted.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line type you prefer to store. the default value is the generally usual selection on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, try & kdiff3; first, to find all identical lines in source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. in this step white characters are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a carriage return character '\' r 'and a newline'\ 'at the end of a line, others can only look identical in the page-to-side comparison although they are different. if this option is checked, waggon returns could be visible, however like a white sign. during merging, this option must be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are nevertheless displayed, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">This option is disabled in default. changes in comments will be treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The option is enabled in the default setting. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next unresolved conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">This is useful when white marks are less important in many files. if you only need this from time to time, use the functions Select A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the Automatic selection also applies conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are discussed in the chapter on scanning folders and performing a merge. see documentation for directory comparison and merge for details.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and an older version already exists, then the original version will be appended to the suffix .orig. if such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapt the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current running program. you will need to terminate and restart so that the change is active. (this option is in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available, because the language is set globally via the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be set separately for each entry. if you enable this option, the top setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">In the selection fields for coding a short note appears, which is the local coding. (this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Customize the file encoding for source files. this will affect how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the encoding for each file is individually configurable, even files with different encoding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding should be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define preprocessing commands, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files could be 16-bit unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) This option allows you to set the encoding of the output of pre-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress emphasis on changes in white characters in text or review columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, you may only see the differences between two of three files. however, sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen for long lines. just stop the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for viewing long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes consider the differences and then abruptly choose to merge the files. a simple click will run the merge and use the file name of the last source file as default name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it will first hand it to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command will be visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor which meets your requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it will first pass this external command. if a standard pre-processing command is specified (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this pre-processing command. you can write your own preprocessor which meets your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is needed and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for newlines to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\)\\\\\ 1 / 'This. * is an ergular expression that matches any character in a line.\\ 1 in the replacement string refers to the found text in uppercase.</seg>
<seg id="2353">The\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you might begin to understand it and maybe you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for a further default command for newlines. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and every hit is replaced by nothing, so quasi deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several substitutions at one time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions from each other. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something else like perl -p -s / regexp / replace / SCHALTER 'However perl requires only (and\\), perl only needs (and) without the previous\\'. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data according to the normal preprocessor will be retained for displaying and merging. further operations only change the data that the line distance algorythmus looks like.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when using a normal preprocessor, the line intercessor displays the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers have to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folders recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object to merge; you can adjust the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and display the simulated changes without actually performing it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging single files. you only need to specify a folder on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as a base. if no destination folder is specified, use & kdiff3; folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically, not the merge. to start the merge, you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (see more details.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, you will be informed about the current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folders, only the files that have been compared to that folder will be listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">If the scan of the folders is complete, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded up. you can open a folder by double-clicking on the + / - click, or double-click on the object, or by using the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions, fold up all subdirectories and open all subdirectories with which you can open or fold up all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double-click on a file, the file comparison will be started and a comparison window will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders then it is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action cannot be automatically selected. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed about problems of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As can be seen in the above picture, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries, the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered to be identical if their entire content is identical. then also folders have the same color. in folders age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green, then yellow becomes yellow and later when it is old, red becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy A (or if A does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such flawed objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such flawed objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode to synchronize is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified and if the option synchronizes directories is active. then selects & kdiff3; the necessary action, so that both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B do exist, but are not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible filenames for the output file only B; copied & diff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are merged and the option New file instead of merging (unsure) is enabled, then an error message appears: files are different, but the same date appears, then an error message appears: files are identical, but the date is identical.. Solange of such errors can not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">When merging, one file is executed after the other. it shows Fertig if the merge was successful, and other messages when something unexpected occurred. if the merge is complete, you should make a final check and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the setup dialog the file comparative method is selected full analysis, KDiff3 will display additional columns. these contain the number of unsolved, resolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or Odner), or all entries at once. if you have selected all merge actions (also in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not have specified a destination folder, C will be used as the target in the Three-Folder Merge mode. B will be used as destination for two folder conversions, and when synchronizing A and / or B will be used as target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check whether all entries should be in the destination folder, also displayed in the folder structure. there are some options that might skip certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (key shortcut). to only merge the current entry: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If conflicting file types still exist invalid merging actions, a message appears that points to the faulty elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When merging all entries, a dialog box with the options will appear, Simulate and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you would like to see what would happen without actually making any changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; performs certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge window opens (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you're done with a file, select again start / continue directory merge or press F7. if you haven't saved it yet, a corresponding dialog will appear. then & kdiff3; its work will continue with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">At the end of the list, you will see some error messages that will help you to avoid the cause of the problem. if you continue the merge (F7 key), lets you choose another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before you proceed with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been individually compiled, it will notice & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and will not merge them again at the later merge. even if the merge operation has been skipped or not saved, these entries are considered to be done. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. multiple patterns can be entered. separate the patterns with a semicolon;. valid wildcard: '*' and '?' (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders do not have to match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignores files that would be ignored by CVS. many self-formatted files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder can be set with a .cvsignor file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some filesystems, files have a default attribute. in other filesystems, a previous score selects a file as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">When the option is turned on, symbolic links are compared. if the option is turned on, the files will be compared to which the links point. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">When the option is turned on, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is turned on, the links will be treated as normal folders and checked recursively. (note that & kdiff3; does not check for possible recursions.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files containing no text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders over a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the modified date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security. please use caution. this option is switched off by default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the date of change. there is no real comparison. the files are considered to be identical when they are equal in size. this can be useful, for example, when copying the modified date. please use caution. this option is deactivated by default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected in such a way that both folders are identical. the results of merging files are also stored in both folders. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging, it is suggested to copy the newer file as an action. (this is considered insecure because it assumes the knowledge that the other file has not been modified.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, then the original version will be renamed and will receive the extension .orig. If an old backup file with the .orig extension already exists, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Usually, the folder merges view while merging single files is visible; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want that, you can switch the option directory & text window to switch main windows in the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between directory & text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge. to do so, you can merge a single file directly from the merge menu. as soon as you save the result, the status will be set to completion and the file will not be merged again if you start the folder merge.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost when you re-read the directory: directory - menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparence with the help of KIO slaves. Kdiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders for opening that are located on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file to an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. you should consider a few things:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. included. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, spaces &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes through the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link shows a file or folder. then a file is always accepted as a link destination. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or modification dates. therefore, the permissions or the modification date deviate from the original. (note the option Confidential of the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently a difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP first always starts the built-in difference viewer. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button above the differences viewer and then select In KDiff3Part, from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally, & kdiff3; two complete input files. however, if it is applied as a part, accepts & kdiff3; the name of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then starts & kdiff3; the patch program starts to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror, you can click on a patch file and select in the context menu Preview in - KDiff3Part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kdiff3; when part is executed, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in part mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">There are already tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now it heats compare) already. furthermore, the name Kdiff3 already indicates that it can merge like the program diff3 from the Diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs very long and have learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or are going to do it.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from the sources and probably didn't tell the configure script the correct prefix to KDE. in the default configure installed in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated as identical; however, if only a non-white character is different, the line is treated as not identical.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notices for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source text and selecting the A / B / C button. however, this important information is lost when the result is simply saved as text file and it is too much effort to design extra a separate file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this has so far been too big. you can always restore a particular version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly rased; No src wins; appeared and the text cannot be deleted. what does this mean and how can that be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses already many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and misses the purpose. please use a different editor for that.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3, you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">For information on how to use Kdiff3 on other platforms without KDE, please visit the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For a list of recent changes, see http: / / knot 3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the ChangeLog file in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde; use the following command in the basic folder of the & kdiff3; -distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir sets the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you can find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake use, you should not have problems when compiling. however, if you encounter difficulties, please report to the & kde; -mailing lists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift-Remove) copies to the clipboard and delete the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift-Paste) inserts the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position or replaces the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Show only differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and consequently not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you need to re-read the refresh folder after making changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">This also means that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder when merging. if the destination folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (the behavior will probably change in a later program version.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the caption A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be appended to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the lines are already present, they will be removed when you click on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; displays a mini preview of all virtual desktops. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the working surfaces, change their size, finish them or shift them. this works both within one desktop and several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual desktops as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved inside & Kpager; the movement is possible both within a desktop and on other working surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: when clicked on the empty Background of & Kpager, the context menu only has to set up the two entries Pager... and exit. if, however, click on an application within & Kpager, the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries Minimize, Maximize, On Desktop and Finish. the commands do the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows can be moved inside the & Kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work areas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">If this field is enabled, in the & Kpager; the names of the virtual desktops are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this box lets the & Kpager; display the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is enabled along with name, the names will be provided with ordinal numbers, & eg; 1. desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is ticked, the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in the & Kpager; displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is enabled, the running programs are displayed as small windows in the & Kpager; otherwise, only the empty desktops are displayed to enable their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the windows with their default icon and Pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. remark: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; main window can be determined: classic lets & Kpager appear; in a 2xN grid, as from pager applications appear in some other window managers; horizontal displays all virtual desktops in a vertical array, which is very well suited for presentation on the side of the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size that can display and move windows as icons or with their contents. in addition, it runs out of the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click within & Kpager; and then set up selector switch... allows the dialog to appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">At the moment this cannot be changed in the dialog. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vice. if you do not have any write permission for the file, you must log in as user root or turn to your system administrator.</seg>
<seg id="2467">Da & Kpager; part of the package kdebase, you need a working installation of the KDE base packages.</seg>

<seg id="2480">This application is interesting for different users: artists, web designers and people with visual impairment are interesting. this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of & kmag.</seg>
<seg id="2481">& kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended to include new functions. it is optimized for use on low-performance computers.</seg>
<seg id="2482">When you & kmag; launch, a window appears as shown above. the main window of & kmag; shows the enlarged portion of the screen. in the following, this window is referred to as the magnification window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">The default setting increases & kmag; the area around the mouse-cursor as a mobile magnifying glass. alternatively, you can & kmag; to do this, set a selected screen area in the magnification window (selector mode) or the environment of the mouse pointer at the edge of the screen (eg; on the left edge of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged window, select the setting mouse pointer. please note, that & kmag; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the default node; / Qt; mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the selection window mode, you can adjust the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointer in the magnifying window and hold the left mouse button pressed, so you can capture and move the contents of the magnifier window. this also works with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">In addition, if you press the & Shift key or the & MMB; use, you can move the selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">This combination allows you to change the size of the selection window. note that the top left corner of the selection window will remain fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& kmag; has a lot of functions. you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer, save it to a file, copy it to the clipboard (to insert it later into other applications), rotate the picture and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Starts or stops the display. stopping the upgrade causes the needed CPU time to go against 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the update rate (Very low, Gering, Medium, High, Very High). the higher the update rate, the more CPU time is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In this mode, a selection window will appear. the selected area is displayed in a window.</seg>
<seg id="2493">& kmag; automatically uses your set short commands to save files, opening a new window, printing, reloading (with the button document reload in & konqueror;), magnifying and reduction & etc;.</seg>
<seg id="2494">Kmag is also known as & kmagnifier; it is a screen loupe. you can use & kmagnifier; to zoom in an area of the screen, as if you would like to use a magnifier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo. this application is useful for different people: from research or artist to web designer or visual impairment.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click as soon as the mouse cursor persists for a while on the same spot. it is intended to help people who suffer from the repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and that each mouse click causes pain.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without any pain. unfortunately, pain caused by the use of your computer may also be caused by a doctor if this has not yet been done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear: even though & kmousetool; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse, and as with all ergonomic aids: the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">Using & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and clicks a mouse click once you stop the motion briefly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">The smart move is activated, makes & kmousetool; pause after pressing the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button. in this way, you can drag the dragging with pressed mouse button. the smart move requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must be spread after the end of the mouse movement, before & kmousetool; a mouse click executes.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligent is switched on, the shooting range is activated (1 / 10 s). here the time is set, the & kmousetool; after pressing the mouse button wait before releasing the mouse button again if there is no moving of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">A slow moving to the left and back leads a double click. a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click. these movements are stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, but it can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound appears delayed, you can & kde; move to the & kcontrolcenter; go to Sound & Multimedia, choose Sound System and here the Rider General. there is a slider sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shorten response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool; started at each start of & kde; this function is currently only available at & kde; available. at GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program there automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Reset all settings to the values set when you open the dialog. if you already have pressed the Apply button, the settings will be reset to the status after the last press is pressed.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with the default settings. in particular, the smart move should let you switch off first. if you are used to the automatic mouse click, you can later move the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it might be necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; for sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First of all, you should be aware of which places a mouse click does not have any effect: clicking on the neutral parts of windows or in the browser window that does not provide a link leads to unintentional reactions. therefore, you can park the mouse at such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse clicks, you should clean your mouse, which is usually rather simple. the trick is that you don't just clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First of all, you need to remove the mouse ball. how this happens is different from mouse to mouse, but it should be clear when you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used. the dirt and dirt can easily scrape off with a flat blade or fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts execution of & kmousetool. if you are using the smart move in this case, it means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be stopped by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use a different window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can carry out a mouse click yourself. this will reset the status of & kmousetool; and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cursor to another location.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to where you want to have it. however, park your mouse on a neutral zone of the desktop if you want to make a keyboard input. thus, accidental moving of mouse clicks can cause unwanted reactions. secure zones for the mouse-cursor are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the title lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the smart move, but I don't make it possible to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart move is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very comfortable to select text to copy it to the clipboard and insert any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. however, you will probably only have problems. here are some advice:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move if you just start using & kmousetool. instead, select a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key while you move the mouse cursor to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this time, every time & kmousetool is played, the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when the moving time starts when the smart move is pushed. later, you can also use the smart move without the audible mouse click. but this requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; to be able to use, the XTest extension for & X window must be installed, which should already be the case on most of the system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and these are correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; activates the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointer waits briefly. this program has been developed for people suffering from RSI's syndrome and which prepares the studiest pain.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to wait for a certain time to start a drag procedure before releasing the mouse button. in this way, drag and drop can also be performed with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is reserved to important messages such as & eg; processor is reserved to hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Messages have the highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you & eg, you can read a long text on a website, you can with & kmouth; notifications are also news.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. any order that you initiate from the postcard order is a text order. Ksayit is an example of a applications that uses text orders. text orders are meant for the output of longer texts that have no particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four types of orders are executed in queues, with the exception of Screen Readers. when an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktops; just one such reader reads, this output is halted and finished.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter the text and pass it on to the next filter. at present there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future, there may be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">String replacement parts replace parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; will be delivered with predefined string replacement filters, which allow the creation of chat emoticons such as: -) by text or for reformatting messages from & conversational; or & kmail; in a better understandable way.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; converters use an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML, from a format to another format.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With subscriber selection filters, you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to & ktts; sent to a speaker. for example, if you have a female voice on the Karteicard spokesman, you can read text of KDE-messages about it. read more.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these filters has adjustable rules according to which it is applied for a speech output. if the filter detects that its rules do not apply, it continues the text to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; -Notification at & ktts; sent, it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the bottom. the processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of the normal filters installed. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters are executed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter, and the subsequent setup dialogs will be shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For the setup of string replacement filters, you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparative sample. if these patterns are found in the text, then the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name as you like, it only has to differ from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the Replace column. the list is executed in the displayed sequence from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. load a list from a file, the entries are appended from the file to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter will only be used if the speaker speaks one of the languages recorded here. click on the button to see a list of the languages. you can also select multiple languages if you press the & Ctrl; key at the click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter multiple programs separated by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID running programs will get you with the program qdbus;. the & dbus; -numbers you have to omit. if for example, the application ID kopete-3432, you may just type copies.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string replacement filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply to an entry in the box Diesen Filter. if all input fields are empty, the filter will be applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When comparing words, the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\ s. the words must therefore be limited to both sides by separators (whitespace).</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions. but if you have installed the & kde; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; for & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; Expressions can be found in the package kdeutils.</seg>
<seg id="2649">XSLT (XML; Style Language - Transforms) is a W3C standard for such transformations. however, it can only be applied to well-formed XML. xsltproc utility has to be installed on your system.</seg>
<seg id="2650">Enter the path for the program xsltproc. if xsltproc is accessible via the environment variable PATH, xsltproc is enough.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the Speaker selection filter you can send texts to a particular speaker, which is set up on the card card speaker, or to a speaker with certain characteristics. for example, you can specify that text by kmail should be read by a female voice. see.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktats; passes a text to the filter, it looks for a speaker for the text. the speaker is selected based on the speaker's characteristics which the program gives, and the characteristics of the speakers set up on the card card.</seg>
<seg id="2653">If a value is entered here, the filter will be applied if the text contains the entered regular expression. is installed on your system the & kde; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; Expressions, you can call it by clicking on the button to get help from entering.</seg>
<seg id="2654">To achieve faster processing, try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, that is, start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Here you specify the characteristics of the speaker you want. if the text meets the filter conditions shown above, the speaker is selected, which meets the requirements most likely. click the button on the right to view the dialog language selection.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to save or load your subscriber settings or delete all settings.</seg>
<seg id="2657">The Speaker selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply to an entry in the box Diesen Filter if applicable. you must enter at least one condition.</seg>

<seg id="2665">None of the mentioned language synthesizers supports my language. where can I get a synthesizer for my speech?</seg>
<seg id="2666">I have set up the & HTML; -XML; -XML; but when using the module for the festival, web pages are not read.</seg>
<seg id="2667">Due to an error in Festival 1.95 beta, you need to install the (male British) voice rab _ diphone so that Sable works at all. you must do that yourself if you do not use this voice to read web pages. also make sure that the program xsltproc is installed and found via the environment variable PATH.</seg>
<seg id="2668">Certain characters or punctuation characters seem to cause errors in synthesizers, so that whole sentences are skipped or only Kauderwelsh is issued. what can I do about it?</seg>
<seg id="2669">First, make sure that the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language. if there are problems with certain characters or words, these may be remedied by a string replacement filter. see.</seg>

<seg id="2677">"speech Dispatcher" program uses an adaptable module architecture for voice synthesizers. if you want to expand & ktops, please contact the developer team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The xsltproc program is used to support SSML and for the & XML; but it is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc using the apt-get install xsltproc command.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile & ktops; to compile, you need a current development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or newer), including packages kdelibs and development files for the speech tool program.</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you get the source code from & ktts; from the source code library for chevets or have downloaded the tarball each night, compile and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you start using the speech synthesizer, first check whether the speech synthesizer works correctly with your voice synthesizer. you can use the shell script spd-conf to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktats; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of 'ktats', which uses the program speech discs. the kttmsgr utility is to be developed in such a way that the set up of speech discs is directly possible and the script spd-conf is no longer required.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is broken down into individual sentences. the user can go back to propositional or paragraph mode, pause, pause or break the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">For example, if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose gender is female, it will be used, otherwise the best matching speaker will be automatically selected. if you want to learn more about how & ktats; select a speaker, look in.</seg>
<seg id="2685">If you click Add a speaker to add a speaker to the list, or click Edit, the tab card display will be displayed. as an example, the setup of the moduls for Festival Interactive will be shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to festival is included in PATH, you just have to enter the festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the character encoding for text passed to the festival. in the case of voices that are known & ktats, this setting is done automatically. generally, Western languages use ISO 8859-1, Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these sliders you can adjust volume, speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you cannot select some controls and display them in gray, the selected voice does not allow these settings to be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like MultiSyn voices need to be loaded for several seconds due to their size. when you select this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD, so that (with greater memory consumption) the first set will be synthesized faster.</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you haven't set up a speaker (or click Apply.).</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, the program window is shown at the start of kttsmgr. otherwise, after the start only the symbol ttsmgr is visible in the system section, but not the program window. click on the icon in the system section to display the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this check box is selected and kttsmgr doesn't run yet, it appears in the system area as soon as KTTSD reads a text. this allows you to pause or otherwise control the reading.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here are all the jobs listed in the queue, along with the application that has commissioned the job, the current status of the job, the number of sentences and the currently edited sentence. the spokesman ID corresponds to the column ID on the card card spokesperson.</seg>
<seg id="2694">With the buttons in this row, you can proceed or go back in the order that is selected in the list below. (but not every order consists of multiple sentences).</seg>
<seg id="2695">With a click on OK, all changes to the settings (also on the other index cards) are taken over and kttsmgr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section. then click on this icon to see the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2696">If the sound system & arts; not installed, but instead ALSA, GStreamer or aKode, click on the Audio tab. see also.</seg>

<seg id="2699">If GStreamer or aKode is to be used for audio output, select the audio output here. if no output modules are displayed in the list, you must install at least one module. if you have selected ALSA, select the PCM device here.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Adjust the speech speed here. 50.% corresponds to about half and 200cent;% roughly the double normal speaking speed. to enable these settings to be implemented, the program must be sox installed.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Click Apply to take the new settings for the running & ktops; system.</seg>
<seg id="2702">The list of ALSA devices includes all PCM devices and modules installed in your system. most of them will not work. you will have to find out which device works with you. in case of doubt, select Default.</seg>
<seg id="2703">On this map you can set up special actions that are executed whenever the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority. & ktts; processes four types of speech records:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of Screen Readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops them. after reading the output of the screen reader, the retained jobs are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next highest priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor is reserved to hot. a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Messages have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that says messages. if you have just read a long text on a website, you can speak with & kmouth; nevertheless someone who just enters the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text order is interrupted by a message, warning or the output of a screen reader, adds & ktts; the audio output is included in the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted. if both the introductory sound and the introductory message are active, the introductory sound will be played before the incoming message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this card are only valid for normal text orders. there are no special actions for messages, warnings and the expenses of Screen Reavers if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To start with & ktops; Notify your Notify messages, start kttsmgr and click Notifications. the card card notifications appear.</seg>
<seg id="2711">Select this check box to enable & kde. if this setting is not checked, the other settings are disabled and & ktts; do not read alerts.</seg>
<seg id="2712">If this setting is selected, notifications with which a sound is played are not read by & ktts; not predefined.</seg>
<seg id="2713">Use these buttons to add or delete events to the list. if you click on the Add button, a dialog appears in which you can select the application and event you want to add to the list.</seg>
<seg id="2714">This event reads the message before, the & Conversation; mailed when somebody mentions your nickname in an IRC message.</seg>
<seg id="2715">All events, for which nothing else is specified in the list, are ignored by & ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2716">Use this drop-down selector to specify what & ktats; do when an event occurs. you have the following choices:</seg>
<seg id="2717">If you have selected user-defined text, enter the text you want. you can use the following wildcards:</seg>
<seg id="2718">You can enter the properties of the desired subscriber here. standard selects the speaker that is shown as the top entry in the list on the card tab.</seg>
<seg id="2719">Note that there are three levels for events. if an action is specified for a certain event of a particular application, the action will be executed. otherwise, the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard for marking text for voice output. this standard contains trademarks for controlling voice, speech speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch. also marks for controlling the pronunciation of for example abbreviations. SSML is part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supported & ktops; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the rab _ diphone voice (british male) as this is the standard voice that the festival uses in the edition of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog are not set to 100%, SSML text is usually spoken very monotonous.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and punctuation detection filters (SDB filters). this can start & ktops; faster with reading, since only the first set has to be synthesized, not the whole text order.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you can see the set definition filter. at the first start of & ktts; as a default, a set-level detection filter is set up automatically. you can change its settings or add more sentence recognising filters, but beginners will get away from it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn the setup of the language selection is to check the language selection and enter text for reading. switch on the language selection, change some features and check how the selection of the speaker is changing.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktops; then can start faster with reading, since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then stop or cancel text jobs on the card card, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set limit identifier is set up automatically when you start ttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, only removed. do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Set definition filters compare text with a regular expression for punctuation and insert a tab character (decimal code 8) at the set limits (tabulator characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering). note that the standard set limit identifier keeps the character set.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters will never be applied to & kde; messages (notify), warnings, messages or the output of screen reavers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal set limit identifier from mistake, you can insert it again by loading the contained file standard _ sbdrc.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The language selection menu can be used to override the subscriber settings for the application.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the default speaker (the top one on the card holder speaker). in other words: there are no speaker properties defined.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most appropriate speaker, which has all the characteristics of an established speaker. if you do not delete or edit the speaker's settings, select & ktops; otherwise select & ktops; the speaker that best meets the originally set features.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired speech properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the desired subscriber here. if this property does not play a role, do not enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Select this check box if the property should have precedence over other properties. you can also place several markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output, it is always treated as a priority property. you will rarely use this property. the only case where you possibly want to specify the attribute language is before, if you know that a certain application text is sent in a different language than the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the properties in the speaker area, which is most likely to delete the following, click the Default selection button, and then use the speaker that is most likely to follow the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case 0 is for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify an order number. (without order number the input 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr casks immediately when it is started. I have compiled debug support, but I don't get any traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crash and & ktops; it has been finished. probably you have to register GStreamer. with GStreamer 0.8.x the order is running-register-0.8. if the problem is not solved by this, you may have a non-compatible version of GStreamer installed. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output via ALSA does not work if I play music at the same time with another application. if I stop a text order, freezes & ktts; a. on the & Console; appears a message that says: Unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">There is a problem in your system that conflicts occur at ALSA that prevent the simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. for possible solutions, see the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the Internet. I installed them and can use them at festival, but respecttsmgr doesn't show this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add the new voice to the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / appeend / voiced int / vocals. if this is successful, please send a patch together with the & URL; where you have found the voice, to the developer.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the Audio tab of Audio there is a setting speed. for this to work, the program must be installed sox and be discoverable via the environment variable PATH. some synthesizer modules such as Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed even on the flashcard for speaker setup. depending on the chosen voice, it is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the speaking speed are ignored if & ktops; & HTML; read. (this is because the speed is controlled in SSML.) Disactivate either the conversion of & HTML; after & XML; (see) or, if you are very brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after-SSML conversion filter, and set the speaking speed up.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't manage to read websites with a female voice. I set up a female festival speaker but & ktats; read the websites with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta the tag Sable GENDER does not seem to work. so that the festival does not produce errors, the xsl file rejects the GENDER-Tags for converting SSML to Saber. the same applies to the VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added a separate string release filter and now I can go in & ktops; no more propositions et way or go back. on the tab orders is shown, the job consists only of one sentence. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">You are not allowed to filter punctuation marks (point, question mark, exclamation mark, comma and semicolon). instead, use a filter for the set limit detection for these characters.</seg>
<seg id="2757">Alsa (Advanced & Linux; Sound Architecture). Alsa is installed on most systems with & Linux; already installed. (www.alsa-project.org)</seg>
<seg id="2758">GStreamer in version 0.8.7 or later. note: make sure that the modules are registered for GStreamer by calling in & ktts before using GStreamer. (HTTP: / / gstreamer .freedesktop.org)</seg>
<seg id="2759">Some users experience conflicts in audio output in connection with ALSA. if your system also counts, you cannot simultaneously play music and read a text. & ktats; freezes in addition if you stop a text order and then start another. possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of ALSA (dmix).</seg>
<seg id="2760">As of July 2005, aKode does not support any real breaks. if you stop a text order in & ktops, the current set will be read yet.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The audio program sox is used for the general setup of the speech speed, but otherwise it is not mandatory. Debian users can sox with the command apt-get install sox. the program is included on most & Linux; -CDs already included.</seg>

<seg id="2768">Before you start using the synthesizer, first check whether your synthesizer works properly. follow the instructions that you have received with the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizers whose source code is open. the quality of the voices is generally good, and several voices and languages are supported.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You must install at least one language. help can be found in the instructions provided with the festival. if you want to read websites, you must install the (male British) voice rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices, you need to compile an additional module, so you need the source code of the festival. German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The voice is still in an early stage of development. unzip the software in festival / lib / vocals / russian /. if you set up the Russian voices, you must enter for the voices MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone. select a Cyrillic (8-bit) encoding such as koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2773">Festival is normally included in the & Linux distributions. therefore, look for the festival as the first on the CDs of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2774">If you want to use the Polish, Hungarian or Czech languages, the encoding option must be set to ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2775">If you want to use the Russian voice, the encoding option must be set to an 8-bit Cyrillic, such as koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2776">Festival can be used together with the & MBROLA; -synthesizer. then the festival takes over the lexical analysis and & MBROLA; this produces the audio output. the & MBROLA; -program and the & MBROLA; -voices can be downloaded from</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; that allows managing network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolCenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a unified, integrated interface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K Menu kcontrolCenter.</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was developed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; the areas of & knetworkconf; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings are displayed in the & kcontrolcenter; the module network settings (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & network Network settings in & KMenu; started.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to enable & knetworkconf, to show the device at all and to set the network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and configured. if network devices are added later, drivers need to be loaded by adapting the following files according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network settings module will be loaded if the option is selected in the & kcontrolcenter; -index. when starting the module network settings, this will automatically detect the used platform on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the manual selection will be offered. it is the platform from the list to choose which matches the distribution and release date best. by checking the non-re-questions the definition can be made permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. before, all options are displayed grey, meaning the settings can only be viewed, changing is not possible. in system management mode, click the button system management mode at the bottom right of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">The system management mode provides the full functionality of the module. it is divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The network interfaces are used to manage network devices of the system. all available network devices are shown. the following tasks can be performed by the network interfaces:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings of selected network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">By selecting Automatically, the TCP / IP settings are fetched from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings for the system are performed simultaneously with the start of the system services. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all required TCP / IP information at each system start, so no further setup is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP will be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection manual, the TCP / IP configuration can be done without DHCP or BOOTP. the desired TCP / IP address must be specified in the input field IP address.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface at boot. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an already existing IP address would result in a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & console, you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in case of doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off as required. switch on an outdated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or turned off as required. switch off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the host's IP address in the local subnet, which conveys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with hosts in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A host with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the appropriate IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the machine calls http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS dissolves this name in an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Entries can be added, removed or changed. entries can be added, removed or changed by selecting an entry and increment or downgrading in the list with the buttons Hinauf or Herder in priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the Add... from the group calculator to name resolution a DNS server can be added. it will be added to the New Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First, enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry will then be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator to name resolution, select an entry and then click the Edit button.... There will be the Edit dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of names, named by name, describes hostname-to-IP address references for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily at boot when no DNS server is available. in small, closed networks it can replace DNS server.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Usually, the list of names containing names contains some entries that support & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses. this still in-test version of IP is to replace version 4 in future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add.... Add New Alias dialog will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button. if the well-known machine has multiple alias names, press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry from a named computer from the list and select Edit.... The dialog Modified Calculator will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be executed one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the Network settings are not effective immediately in the system. in order to activate the changes, the following command must be set in a & Console.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The home page of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is enough if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Installing the precompiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool with graphical interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of your distribution can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & kde does not suffice; in addition, the development packages are needed with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended by experienced users only. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter important information about basic network technology is given, in the second all of them are discussed by & knetworkconf; configurable configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In this appendix only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small (home) network is conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently being operated using TCP / IP Version 4 (IPv4). IPv6 has never found a great deal of dissemination. IPv6 is expected to continue in the near future. therefore, this description is currently focused on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is assignable. in foreign networks, at & eg; the network administrator is the contact point to assign a valid IP address or, if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address cannot be chosen arbitrarily.</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up a small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, so their arbitrary use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are usually used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0 so that all the hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = your own machine). the default route is required for IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to its own loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">This part contains the configuration files that are affected by the & knetworkconf file and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed with DSL connections so that it is not surprised if there is another content than specified in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is randomly reassorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. a different stand than expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar that also provided the ability of dds2tar for quick, selective unpacking.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before using a tape, it must be mounted by & kdat; it can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; download the tape backwards and read the pre-tensioning information of the tape. detect & kdat; don't know the pretext on the tape, you'll be asked if the tape should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognize & kdat; the pronoad, searches for the right index on your disk. if it cannot be found, you'll be asked if the band index is to be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything has gone smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been integrated. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched by flaps of the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the tape, the integration must first be resolved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; indicates by changing the symbol for the tape to recognize that the integration for the tape has been loosened and displays a corresponding message in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape of & kdat; can be used, it must be formatted by & kdat;</seg>
<seg id="2901">A strap type must be formatted before you can use to store data. this process does not correspond to formatting at & kdat;. if your tape drive requires formatting before use, this must happen before you can format the tape from & kdat; Floppy tape drives usually require formatting of the tape, whereas DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity drives & kdat; continue with the format of the tape. all data on the tape will be lost! after completion of the formatting process, the tape is automatically integrated and ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you initiate the backup process, you must select the files to be secured. this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local filesystem. only this file or folder will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Mark files in the local file tree with a tick. only the so marked files and / or subfolders are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Rightclick the local file tree and select Save in the Save... menu.</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been started, the Configuration dialog opens. in this dialog you can once again check the selected files and change the backup settings.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Once you have confirmed the settings, the backup will appear. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. only the selected file or folder will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Rightclick in one of the archives and select the menu item Test....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test has been started, the dialog will display Settings for review. in this dialog, you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the review settings, the dialog appears to Validate. this dialog displays the progress of the audit procedure as well as the data throughput and the time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can initiate the restore, the files to be restored must be marked. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive entry. only the selected file or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Rightclick on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore in the menu....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the restore process has been started, the dialog will display Settings for Recovery. in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Once you have confirmed the recovery settings, the dialog will re-establish. this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re-create the band index file using the band's contents. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can re-create the index on two types of the tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder in which the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected work folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders listed under backup files, only the files in it are backed up that are located on the same file system as the folder. folders that are on other filesystems, you can enter separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar independently of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Performing an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Delete the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the knobs files & gt; & gt; & lt; lt; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can be set up using the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-winding version of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">This setting is active, transmits & kdat; before the tape is mounted, the load will be loaded to the drive. in some drives, this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, tries to lock the ejection with the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is enabled, the release of & kdat; automatically ejected the tape. do not use this option with Floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is turned on, tries to change the hardware-based block size for the tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you must tell the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; formatted a tape, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should occupy only one memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band id. the format of this string is machine name: seconds, whereby the hostname is the full name of the system on which the tape has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds passed since the era in which the tape has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The Band-ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat / folder.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; tar. even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incremental backups.</seg>

<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog; functions available to easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>

<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter by a selected criterion or after entered strings. in the default setting, the selection field will be displayed next to the filter. in the default setting, a protocol line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can, of course, select another entry. the string of the filter search term will then be selected only with entries in the corresponding column. for example, in the protocol file system log, select the column process, and in addition, enter the name of a process in the filter bar, so show you & ksystemlog; all log messages sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. note-lines of level errors are indicated with a more conspicuous color than protocol lines of the level indication. the colored display of protocol lines can be switched off setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only certain processes (e.g. in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can, for example, be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can check the Add to New Lines option in the main window context menu to view all new add-in lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows you to display multiple log files in separate sub-windows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub-windows. once you have selected a sub-window, select a protocol to display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. There you will find more information about the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor rather known (and named in the following) as & ksysv; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init quickly becomes the standard for the control of the program start when the system boots up in the & Linux world. this is because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go into historical aspects here (e.g. because I do not know about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might attempt to convert a machine to system V Init without a reinstallation and reformat. the & Linux; kernel first looks at / etc after an init file. therefore, you must make sure that the old init was removed from there, if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort, rc.sysinit and the following folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for every system service you want to start at boot up the system or when switching to another running level. system services do not include such things as setserial, which is started only once. such calls are based on rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems do not have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also use rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches for init at different places after the program and starts the first one to find.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. in the beginning range you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look into the second column and probably notice that the default Runtime 3 is. if you want to change this, then you can edit / etc / inittab from hand and change the 3. if you have confused it, then you come to repair it by rebooting the system and doing the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does all the right scripts start? if you type ls -l in rc3.d then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no proper files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script will be invoked with the argument call. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the argument launch.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server running level that only lets httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc; I could also have a user running level, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Using & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is easy to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six running levels to launch it at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runleveln or change the position within a level by removing it somewhere else. the entry is removed from its initial round level (or its position). this only happens when they draw an entry from the area of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved when you move them to a new area. to simply copy them to a new Runtime, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert it to the target range -- even if the same entry already exists in the target range of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore records that have been thrown into the trash. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the different working areas (Available system services, Runtime 1 Start, Runtime 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to select a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another run-level, move it with cropping into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired Runtime with Insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To manually change the sorting number or name of an entry, press the Enter key to open the Properties dialog. use the Tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are saved in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are recovered from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard runlevel, and now the machine is constantly running. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input key to start in the single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be ok).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; intended to run under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you will need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions, simplifies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions but unfortunately does not comply with any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution: please check if all configuration files are available that are required by the system service (and whether they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) just end without a message when their configuration files are not present or configured incorrectly.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; running level varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you are using a different distribution, please send me information about the running level so that it can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation relates to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter Adaptation of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After making changes, you need to save it. either use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or the Save In the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">The main window consists of two card cards, the user and the user group list. for editing, select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry. it appears the dialog user and group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are only shown if you have advanced system settings. only when you have enabled space restrictions (quota) for users, a flashcard is created on which you can make individual settings. more card flashcards appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The file password management card appears if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD UNIX.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card only appears if the quota for at least one file system (quota) is enabled and initialized (identifiable by the file quotiuser / quota.group on the file system). here, parameters can be changed for each user, whereby the space restrictions are respectively in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system is selected using the file system with space limitation.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The Groups menu provides information about the group's group affiliation. the default group to which the user belongs, can be found in the Primary Group field. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The Group's dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the user or group menu or click the Add button on the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or the selected group works analogously.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO boot manager, add, remove and modify the boot password, add time to boot of the default operating system, add, remove, modify operating systems, remove, change and more.</seg>
