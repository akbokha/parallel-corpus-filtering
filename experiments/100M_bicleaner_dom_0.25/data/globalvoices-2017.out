although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordinarily great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , American authors read and practiced sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was a journalist mainly because of an American film .
at the age of 14 I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , how he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can letter , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , uncovered the mur@@ der@@ ous plot of an oil magn@@ ate , who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were willing to occupy his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was as if this is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona had only reinforced my admir@@ ation for the USA .
I always said , &quot; America is the only country I &apos;ve ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I had even written a very fan@@ atic love letter about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most unusual aspect of his ascension is for me , as he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
in his opinion , he never thinks behind the mountain as you say so nicely .
he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague put it , and openly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless people responded to his statements and agreed to him in dro@@ ves .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can prim@@ aries was the highest figure ever reached by a party nominated by the party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ?
I could not reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I had met during my time in Phoenix .
like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program that records people from around the world , a deeply dev@@ out person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
he did not agree with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I had met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
tr@@ umps In@@ tolerance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fought for her life for the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son .
she still fits the dedication of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me much in my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love toward America .
while Tr@@ ump paid his way to the nom@@ inees Republi@@ can presidential candidates , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the debate with the idea that people voted for tr@@ ump because they either shared their rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to design@@ ate the plat@@ inum @-@ voters as ra@@ cists .
to arrange the people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
it is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and suggests an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears over the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , would they perhaps say that they are still important in America ?
maybe .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comment@@ ates on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t for those who look different than he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( N.@@ B. Ü ) : as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rebellion of the wh@@ ites against all other ethnic groups &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether it is myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have , America welcomes everyone .
for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history , as he himself says , would never be possible anywhere else in the world .
with the election of Donald Tr@@ ump , however , a huge portion of the White America promises this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
in all this , I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
at a rally for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd responded with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried , and their voices cried out lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone , who is not like you , would have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and vocal &quot; NO &quot; !
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , this is not your America . &quot;
the land for which his son was fallen sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ ump Land , said the message .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan could no longer find a place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

from the misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love of music through rub@@ b@@ ish
the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .
image of Fli@@ ck@@ r user O@@ EA @-@ O@@ AS ( CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 ) .
what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in O@@ ax@@ aca province share with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
that the music played in both places has not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the tr@@ ash
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular with tourists -@@ but worlds apart from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now the La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces , is known for its drug abuse and gangs violence .
but this changed after a chance encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth thus offered a rare ray of hope .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Noti@@ ci@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the h@@ ust@@ le and bu@@ stle and play the trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , french horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from waste
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is practically located at the biggest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ manufactured instruments made of local solid waste materials produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Cha@@ vez have begun to turn parts of the waste into instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ ophone , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums , all produced from the garbage .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article by the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the early times :
first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage . the children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something he had never seen before : a violin made of tr@@ ash .
today there is an entire orchestra playing instruments of re@@ manufactured material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentary called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world produces about one billion tons of waste every year .
those who live with him and of him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra has even played its music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , practical solutions for environmental problems .
the re@@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the common use of content .
in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already operated underground fishing in Liber@@ ian waters before it visited the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were correspon@@ dingly raised and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind at their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambique and the Seych@@ elles quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to grant him a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fish@@ eries authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there .
in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million dollars in Liberia , due to lo@@ oting the fish stocks of the country .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal F@@ ish@@ eries ) .
in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that then expelled the prime minister from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and working together . they exchange information and support each other where it is about illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Il@@ legally Fishing . this project offers F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to track down . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing in regions .
by ignor@@ ing existing laws by which specific habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the sn@@ ail speed , with the information between individual countries , the actions today are happening in real time , trace@@ able to F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , individual countries can exchange lists of existing lic@@ ences , news about suspi@@ cious activities or details that one notices or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i is also very attentive to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data .
this makes it possible for the authorities to identify vessels that fish in forbidden areas . such suspi@@ cious routes can also be discovered - such as those indicating that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such examinations can show whether the participating vessels have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly also whether they have a pen@@ al register .
countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports on the basis of this information . which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there is considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , senior director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to gain an estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue that the eight members of the H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network lost every year due to illegal fisher@@ man inv@@ ading in East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries , which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from around the world . among them also illegal fisher@@ man .
their practices include , among other things , actions such as sailing under false flag , fake license documents , speci@@ fying imag@@ inary names , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately util@@ ise the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non @-@ pat@@ ently organized control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past a ship could be fishing illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You cannot run my harbor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; yet another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole is trying to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far , the closed front is working .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspected ships .
it has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used multiple frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has pursued and found escap@@ ing ships .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crimes , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that aims to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to track down the illegal ships that would like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position , and that is what we try to cross , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , head analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fish@@ eries data and offers F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , switch off their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be located by satellites .
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping to build a system that links different levels of information . it is intended to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to find criminals with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the NGO Sky@@ Truth , believes this .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has been opening the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oce@@ ana Marine Guard Organisation : a platform that provides satellite data and can be displayed anywhere in the world via the position of each individual tracking ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbours to get a better picture of who is doing what is happening - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and pool their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust has a similar project to run where a global system allows prosecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals , but also deter them .
ships that used to be over@@ f@@ ished without license , and hardly had to face consequences , now know that they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i are now seeing a 33 % increase in fishing turnover , since fishing boats have bought more lic@@ ences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped to track &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gre@@ ko 1 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the inspec@@ tors found there tra@@ w@@ l nets that were banned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa hundreds of millions of dollars disappear every year by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
six countries have joined forces in 2015 , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are also fighting illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . . &quot; safety is the goal of allowing even more such initiatives and structures to emerge in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state Somalia was able to report its first big triumph : in October it turned Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship under a false flag . and not only was the ship on the way without a license and were used tow@@ ing nets which are now prohibited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship has also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they are against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ber@@ gh says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special collaborative approach to protecting the oceans actually works across the oceans . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London .

the road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .
this picture of María Ale@@ j@@ andra Mor@@ a shows a close up of the demonstration in Mar@@ ac@@ ai@@ bo in 2014 .

after the government of Venezuela rejected the application of the opposition to a referendum on the dis@@ miss@@ al , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the country &apos;s political and economic crisis ran into the void by vent@@ uring on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : the re@@ funding of Venezuela ) , both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found .
the debate is also being conducted in other parts of the country , including the Bar@@ inas low@@ land area , the Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a low@@ land areas , the Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o Bun@@ de@@ an State and Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the country &apos;s political and economic situation is deterior@@ ating continuously , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans through an acute lack of food and medication .
many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the inauguration of the current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately the reluct@@ ance of a new election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , contribut@@ ors to Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ises the context of the Government decision in her latest article as follows :
within the framework of the social , political and economic crisis , where inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the end of the year ) and in which there is a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine , the referendum on many as the only way to give the country the opportunity to rec@@ ap@@ ture its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or MU@@ D ( for example : round table of the Democratic Un@@ ity ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together , urged the demonstr@@ ators to join the majority of representatives of the opposition after the 2015 elections .
the call was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows :
it is so far Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide civilian strike and on November 3 , all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the action programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , October 26 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pictures of the mar@@ ches published in real time , among other things , testify to the overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government .

on Twitter , images that talk of confron@@ tations , as well as reports of oppression and abuse , are accum@@ ulating on Twitter .
especially large waves beat the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there , the demonstr@@ ators moved back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement in front of the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
hours later , they could leave the cathedral safely , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State T@@ á@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a wear no skir@@ ts because otherwise you could see something that many National Gu@@ ards did not have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic is already making the round that sets the level of repression per day :
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for an official opening procedure - this was now proved in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .

others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government which , from their point of view , under@@ took little against the devastating economic crisis and preferred to keep critical voices silent :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches are increasing in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media that they were too hungry to take part in a strike rather than work or go shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine news site .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to take a look at the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city of Cór@@ doba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now testified at the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial in the province of Cór@@ doba against his father .
in the trial ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship were investigated .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
starting with the burden of bearing the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept family secrets .
in the situation at that time , I thought it was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turer and killer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a police officer . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the intelligence department 141 in La Per@@ la prison .

no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ y@@ an@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had experienced as a boy and who testified before a Federal Constitutional Court against his own father .
his story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from sports hall to military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts .
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and invited me to identify my friend for it .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you are friends with one of the ERP .
don &apos;t worry that they will not take you one day and I will have to save you .
the short@@ cut ERP stands for Ej@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , a Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Argent@@ inian revolutionary workers &quot; party .
therefore he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be ok .
at the military base I had to destroy documents that had belonged to the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ then the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - everything in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a barracks , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - everything possible - stood .
all of it was stolen .
he gave me a small package wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver inside .
on that day I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen items were stopped and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
then the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I sp@@ ed in , and saw a song that men were tor@@ tured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person lying just there .
they tied a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it with water and put a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ fic ... like a dirty p@@ add@@ ling .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I immediately recognized the smell and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it possible for a person to do so much harm to another ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ I knew these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked men lay down with the face - all were tied at their hands and feet .
near the entrance , people mun@@ ched quietly on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father saw that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What are you looking for , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you bring me up ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were cast into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me about it .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero cl@@ ashed a man there and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to information from survivors , Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , charges the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , runs through the former torture chambers .
the path you have come in here is also the way where the ab@@ duc@@ tions came here .
when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came to be laid .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; war boot@@ y &apos;
my father brought home all sorts of stolen things .
back then at age , I had no idea what the &quot; war boot@@ y &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was in the military myself later - I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war boot@@ y is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military markings that are taken away from an enemy that has been fought .

but if you go into a house and steal the refrigerator , record player , clothing , painting , money ... this is not a war boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to inv@@ ade a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my dad could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; And you who fed cars on the streets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded rage , hit me and scre@@ amed :
if you go so far , I will find you and kill yourself .
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do that !
my father was like that .
I have no good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of back then , on which I wore a jacket and a tur@@ key jum@@ per of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes at home .
at that time , the defence accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can tell me what they wanted .
I was there anyway to say .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of cor@@ p@@ ses is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &apos;
now that I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , you can see the value of a life .
one develops further and recognis@@ es that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , you executed people in the dictatorship , but why did the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
why do children kidn@@ ap ?
one day my father brought a girl home whose mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I repeatedly asked myself : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could have been put in jail .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why did their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
did these people not also have families to whom one could hand over their mortal remains ?
the disappearance of cor@@ p@@ ses is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that one can do to a man .
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they took machines to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course there is always something left .
&apos;@@ i saw how you killed people ! &apos;
only to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the idea of showing my father was born during a meeting when he was under house arrest .
I made accus@@ ations for all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked myself why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they allegedly defended were good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something like that ?
I saw how you killed people !
you committed terrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he only replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , then show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I issued the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can reproach me that I am bi@@ ased . I finally said against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes : severe , illegal de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 15@@ 8 cases , torture in 15@@ 4 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture followed by death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years old .

the Jud@@ gments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the size of the judgment in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases the court sentenced to life imprisonment and in nine cases prison sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ Jud@@ gment : murder , torture and rape by officials .
all the accused were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police personnel and civilian personnel .
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was ab@@ duc@@ ted together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for the victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , lawyer of the Argent@@ ine@@ an organisation H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , who represents the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but the research took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was located so that there could be a memorial site , which is now run by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes elderly people in Kyoto to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a centre in Kyoto , where you can extend your driver &apos;s license .
the photo was distributed in social media .
adaptation of the original photographs by Joshua Levi .
in the Japanese town of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre where one can pro@@ long his driving licence , last month witnesses of a particularly mis@@ used translation .
the Japanese word ( kor@@ ean bel@@ sh@@ a ) , which means &quot; older mot@@ orists , &quot; is wrong@@ ly translated into a shield , but may also be translated as &quot; terrible mot@@ orists . &quot;
the incorrect translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic advertisement in the entrance area and in the building itself .
adaptation of the original photographs by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was widely shared in the social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a citizen of Ky@@ ot@@ os , who also made the local newspapers aware of it .
the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , which is appearing in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bad English translation was first removed . the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , even gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already included in the text they had received by the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sincere sorry that elderly people felt offen@@ ded by inadequate correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News was somewhat more detailed about the phenomenon of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists in Japan apart and wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot;
the word &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older mot@@ orists . according to the police , the proportion of older mot@@ orists who are involved in accidents across the country , but quite a cause for concern .
in Kyoto , for example , in 2005 1,@@ 9@@ 41 were caused by a total of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 accidents suffered by sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors provoked 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of total 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has increased in the same period .
the repor@@ ter named in particular brought comments to the light in the version of the article published on Yahoo , which show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to cher@@ ish against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo about the translation error was given the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is that ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about not reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So is the translation really wrong , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not only a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread across Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and to use active language skills to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English to French - not from French to English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their native language , which could make translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding for transl@@ ating , tasting or the relatively low number of native speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies that do not have foreign employees will nevertheless make translations pe@@ er @-@ internal . then , the Japanese employee , whose English skills are considered the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widespread - often with funny results .
the confused and en@@ ig@@ matic phrases produced by mechanical translations show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest British phrases in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling im@@ prints that often decorate T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery . however , from large companies or government that have the means to ensure higher standards , more careful translations can be expected .
in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television take place
the main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the websites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible .
other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also recorded footage of protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organized by opposition groups who opposed the government of Nicol@@ ás Ma@@ du@@ ros .
protests began at the beginning of April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was coupled and advised the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# C@@ ens@@ orship : activates your VPN .
it seems that web pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an Provi@@ ders are closed again .
this is from @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offerings such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media has been hes@@ it@@ ant in the reporting of protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission threatened to punish them with fin@@ es and closures as they continue to report on the demonstrations because the Commission saw this as a &quot; appeal to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I have signed up again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
it is amazing that it is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ IO confirmed later that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels .
earlier investigations of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond in@@ correctly to requests of certain domains .
if a web@@ page is blocked by the DNS , the server responds in@@ correctly or refuses to request the request when calling such a web site .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third blocked channel , the transmission was suspended on Thursday , 6 April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera man El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was arrested .
Flor@@ es was beaten , while he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections , making it increasingly difficult for Venezu@@ el@@ ans to access multi @-@ media coverage of the current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves in order to get a training
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today , T@@ ina is fighting for the rights of children and ga@@ thers testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ adi@@ tas who have been victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the abri@@ dged version of a report written by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , falling schools &quot; ) edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before gradu@@ ating from university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house filled with pride about her . &quot; she &apos;s like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she who has become something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a never was treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she started working as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ ta , Paraguay is known as more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers their under@@ age son or their under@@ age daughter to another , ri@@ cher family . in exchange , the child receives food , training and a roof over his head .
what is not mentioned , however , is that the children must pay for it innum@@ erable days of house@@ work , which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a treaty that one cannot raise .
this practice called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of its participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke to Cri@@ adi@@ ta - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected witnesses , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to name things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that is ino@@ cul@@ ated by the Cri@@ adi@@ ta is generally not silent .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family , who is their daughter in the belief that they complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out of themselves , &quot; is transferred to another family .
on the other hand , the family who assimil@@ ates the girl and justi@@ fies its exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise not receive education , and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will experience it for many years later .
sometimes they never experience it .
in January 2016 the relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín was born in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of violent blows . shortly thereafter she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the home of the former military @-@ member Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ ín was living with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3.000 inhabitants , 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 , F@@ errei@@ ra attacked Mar@@ ín as long as she suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported on the incident .
they stressed the fact that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela responsible for the death of the girl deeply rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there was &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate children &apos;s rights un@@ punished .
without official documents , it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbors of the married couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for a quick study of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
if the case comes to justice , Carolina Mar@@ ín &apos;s case could be trend @-@ setting - for the first time in Paraguay &apos;s history , a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes before court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as labour force , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , in which her father worked , had to register bankrupt@@ cy and her father lost his work .
their brothers now had to work all the time and began to sell cand@@ y on the street or on the market to earn money .
but they all went further to school .
only T@@ ina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
in the house of her employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
she had to share the time in such a way that she still had time to learn .
she got up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for her employer .
on Fri@@ days , for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more she finished learning , the more free time she had .
but even this time was limited because she had to have dinner for her employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I was able to get more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge , &quot; she re@@ members .
the library was well @-@ equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 , belonged to the opposition .
in some evenings the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand next to him and read articles from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince them not to believe in the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the host had found someone who listened while talking about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they did not often allow me to visit my family because they felt that I would learn &quot; bad habits &quot; again . &quot; so they thought that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , would again speak to Guar@@ an@@ í at home .
their masters feared that they would lose the education they had made possible for them .
she was fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
also in school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never talked about is bul@@ lying and har@@ ass@@ ment exposed to Cri@@ adi@@ ta when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone home to me . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships are born , I felt especially clearly that I belonged to no group .

the Society endor@@ ses the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and pedi@@ atric girls in Paraguay .
the group &apos;s administrator is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a municipal coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please report to us .
starting from Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had an el@@ event@@ h girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman , who came also from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she loves little children and she is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the third commentary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the hear@@ tland , who wants to work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was written . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the author of the advertisement folded again :
dear friends , I found one . I see if it works with it .
thank you , I write again if something is .
the shop was closed .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ adi@@ tas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ adi@@ ta , how long ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ adi@@ tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history we managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay ) , where the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of Guar@@ an@@ í , had to pay tribute to their &quot; wives &quot; ) and the system of the Mens@@ a ( where the workers were treated as semi @-@ slaves ) .
social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the display of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill describes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
image of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , changed by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian MPs recently voted for a bill on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regulations concerning the use and benefits of social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he is accepted by the Parliament , users of social media in Egypt must register with a government authority to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up which is authorised to authori@@ ze citizens to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users must register on the website of the site with their correct names and identity card numbers in order to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , this could result in a penalty of up to six months imprisonment or a fin@@ es .
the bill consists of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ ses in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application running over the Internet and used to communicate with others by means of voice , video tut@@ oring and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities can impose registration on users . it is also unclear how they should account for those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media enterprises .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , Par@@ liam@@ entary Committee and suppor@@ ter of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a username and password from the T@@ elecommunic@@ ation Ministry to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of those it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network .
but it is not yet known that such plans exist .
experts on the ground are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; leading research technologi@@ sts &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Human Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I strongly believe in the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things to do with technology . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously , it means that they will set up a powerful surveillance system to filter out citizens who request permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to lead them to a trial .
this is technically not realistic , but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to act as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before entering the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether his acceptance and enforcement is successful or not , the draft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in accordance with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and that no dis@@ sent@@ ing nar@@ ration is present on the screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed legislation against cy@@ ber crime , in which a life sentence for those intended to thre@@ aten &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;
how a Kurdish natural conserv@@ ation@@ ist protects the Persian le@@ op@@ ard in war @-@ drawn Iraq

high up in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal rights activ@@ ist H@@ ana Ah@@ med Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq aim to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the le@@ op@@ ard family , which stri@@ ves through Africa and Asia , belongs to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus Sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . all in all , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they find less and less loo@@ t .
why is this particular le@@ op@@ ard important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem depends also on the fact that a big pre@@ dat@@ or is present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a record of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out pure joy .
as a bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a passion@@ ately shows a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wildlife and educational programs from Nature Iraq for six years .
she has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to providing protection zones for wildlife in the Kur@@ dist@@ an region .

at the beginning of March 2017 , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the North @-@ Nor@@ theast of Japan , documented the progress made over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; Triple Cat@@ astrophe &quot; in March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atomic accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had triggered the disaster .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture was a number of pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , which experienced both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring villages Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to flee , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had lost entire coastal cities off the map .
the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture once again experienced a nuclear accident , so alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o &apos;s special report shows from a local point of view what progress has been made six years later to rebuild the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both the statistics of the Japanese Imperial Administration and the survey results of the affected persons themselves .
the residential construction site in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses ( to be used , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to record the greatest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , where 80 per cent of the planned replacement houses were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate completed 75 percent of such houses , while Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma de@@ but@@ s the closing light at 70 percent .
however , even six years after the catastrophe , the evacu@@ ation of temporary shel@@ ters ( to be used to res@@ ett@@ le cas@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) into final spare @-@ homes .
after the triple disaster almost 80@@ ,000 people were forced to live in temporary shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 still 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate still lived in such dwell@@ ings .
almost 40 percent of those evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful here . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ated homes were res@@ ett@@ led into final homes .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools who were affected by mis@@ fortune have opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while almost 100 per cent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident have affected agricultural land extensively in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , accounting for only 66 percent of agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 per cent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farm@@ land by Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are located in the &quot; nuclear black@@ out zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures the tourism has recovered largely , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far ab@@ used .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent at the same level as before disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can show only 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal dw@@ ellers found it more difficult to earn their living .
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
in order to establish an overall picture , the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacu@@ ees . it questioned them about the state of reconstruction and also how their emp@@ athy towards the ts@@ un@@ ami @-@ risk has changed .
in its introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the local population .
the survey showed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents took measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents find that still not enough was done in disaster prevention .
how it is about those who had to be evacu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its edition of the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the tremendous earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witness to the worst disaster @-@ induced nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed .
of 160 000 evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63@@ ,000 people were reloc@@ ated to areas outside of the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 more than 23@@ ,000 people were res@@ ett@@ led back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , in permanent replacement homes .
according to the 2017 booth , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
most of the evacu@@ ated victims in the disaster areas are older than 50 years old . it is well known that the efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people come across people from other countries who speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one often recognizes that one more links than it seems at first glance .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we talk to five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders .
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities between Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how the love of music overwhel@@ med the lack of common language skills during a trip in rural China ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time she worked with people from all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being beaten up by the police in nationwide demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z . publication with permission .

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was admitted to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer had struck him in a strike against the head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity measures .
Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on this Saturday and now put him in an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a strike . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police announced in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the investigation of the incident was suspended by the active service .
the pictures show the police officers , how he strikes in Go@@ i@@ ana with his stick on the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten up by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be on TV for six months and the entire repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a news channel from media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video taken by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs are rus@@ hing to him .
another video with the same scenes , filmed from another perspective , is also immersed in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus living in another state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( approximately 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ ana while he is in hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police violence . &quot;
the drawing was shared several times in social networks .
by : Hei@@ r Vil@@ ela . publication with permission .
on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for more violent attacks against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás is experiencing a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father , because he was accused of crimin@@ alizing the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who is in the intensive care unit after being attacked by a polic@@ eman who struck him with a stick .
police Trans@@ actions
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil in which there was brutal police action against prot@@ esters last Friday .
police officers were at protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set up a stage for or@@ ators , rubber floors and tear gas .
the MEP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violent demonstrations against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeakers .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media have sli@@ pped street protests by focusing on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S.@@ Paolo pur@@ pos@@ ely reported on a broken glass window to illustrate their front pages illustr@@ ative .
on the other hand , O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special thing .
this must also be recognised if you are strictly opposed to any kind of damage .
here again , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; gets an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violence of the military police is covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation course with the police . &quot;
the villages forgotten by the indu@@ str@@ alization in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane mills in the whole of Cuba closed doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the popular village Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - despite the fact that there is no appreci@@ able sugar harvest on site .
it is two years ago when the activities in sugar cane mills were paraly@@ sed .
after exhaus@@ tion , the sugar cane industry in the region stood still , and the factory gradually lost its installations until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ ign and commu@@ te daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who rises every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane mills in the east of the region , which after a long in@@ active time were back in operation because they were received .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene re@@ members that Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich would receive the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry had already resist@@ ed the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 .
the message would have been a motive for concern for the country several decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no longer a novel@@ ty .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old platform of the church already saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane mills were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive they became unbe@@ ar@@ able for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
between 2017 and 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 published report &quot; Regional economic perspectives &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the Agriculture and Food Organisation of the United Nations .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate around 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , a total of 98 sugar cane mills , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he repeated most is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dec@@ eption &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents were of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first leap year , the first letters began to come .
these were officially recorded documents , which were distinguished only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on the responsibility was passed and the letters were becoming more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the dis@@ continued factory for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane mills still in use , &quot; he ass@@ ures .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , wa@@ its for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was in charge of his will to shut down the factory in whose construction he helped .
with every part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 years of working .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and most important work@@ tops has been extingu@@ ished .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for the jobs and services generated by the facilities in the municipalities where they were located .
we will never know whether during the M@@ amm@@ oth speech of 21 October 2002 , the then President looked into the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would go well .
the price of the population for closure of sugar cane mills
since 2004 , sugar cane has been extracted only high by milling .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years , the village Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said than they began to deter them , they also stopped asp@@ hal@@ ting the road , this dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with an advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they were replaced with spare parts .
without the prospect of the future many young people left the region .
a food factory has been created in the area , and its production does not even serve to supply the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began working .
nin@@ ety @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring to the old soldier a retirement of two thousand pes@@ o per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and a clear voice , is no supporting person , yet he does not forgive the lies that you told him .
they have been tor@@ turing him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes back 65 years in retirement , not because it lacks power , but because he is bit@@ terly .

first Nations young people use hip @-@ hop to express themselves and get their own culture
welcome to a song by &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an .
young people of the First Nations communities across Canada deal with themes that are important to them . they do it through Hip @-@ Hop , thanks to a number of walking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an Tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile audio studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the pedago@@ gue David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked with ten Cre@@ e @-@ Communities in North @-@ Que@@ bec and then collabor@@ ated with the Cre@@ e hip @-@ hop group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
the workshop thus increases that the young participants discuss topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , conflict , love , self acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes to mind .
these questions are an inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the territory of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ mon@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a street section in West kan@@ ada , where nearly two dozens of mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered .
most of the cases were not clari@@ fied .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to medi@@ ate the importance of preserving traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people did not always speak the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ so@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the refrain is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved here received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars hip @-@ hop band , who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dialect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an the verse is available in tran@@ script , as is a translation into English translated into German :
sometimes I feel like nobody ever is interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
this is the day when you will hear our cry
because we as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and move forward as well as our youth
so they can do what they intended for the Creator
in the comments section the reader and advoc@@ ate of Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the verse to sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ us ( which is also published on his blog and is reis@@ su@@ ed here with permission ) :
plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant in Japan
plastic dishes ( to be used at any time ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , are shown close to the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin gent@@ pur@@ u ( see the &quot; plastic models of dishes &quot; ) of every dish served in this restaurant .
customers will see these plastic dishes and then decide whether they will enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the to@@ ki@@ oter district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a large number of small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they do not even notice them . a new trend , however , is now transformed into show@@ y mobile accessories and other gad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin gent@@ pur@@ u .
now in the special sale : new plastic strips , decorated with plastic rib@@ bons , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial food were turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collecting properties , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin cooling magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in eating habits is becoming more and more complex .
in this case , an imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
we also produced this part for the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple holding your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
some mobile phone stands and mobile designers allow you to make your own work of art . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or salmon roe is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there anybody who would say : &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon che@@ ating ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form in order to surprise e.g. colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest mobile stand has the shape of melting ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and w@@ rist@@ bands of dried salmon .
further whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal plastic dishes you can watch at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the story of survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports from domestic and foreign media on the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug trade &quot; in Mexico , the missing and ge@@ aring regularly appear only in statistics . these , however , do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle brings .
the reports of drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background .
the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind every body , behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds might never heal .
for this reason , the Mexican news portal Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co . &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co describes the project like this :
organized crime not only causes us to fear our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
for example , when shops close because they are threatened by traffi@@ ckers and whole communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how fear lives change &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches for secret graves after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on just one day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like every Sunday we prepare ourselves today for the task which we have set ourselves to go and search for tom@@ bs , according to the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is named Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October , he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need a training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is here with me too .
at the moment it has no income .
you are the insurance of my father , but she does not pay her because they demand a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have known illness and sensation@@ alism for several years now .
I come across newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the front pages with images that can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from files of specialists .
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin is thinking that he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealer ) when he is big . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they walk through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ action of people is incredible for me , if the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village could be justified by the fact that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so@@ aked &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to argue that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies if they do not touch and remain silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the Capital City district : how a family was lo@@ oted with threats . &quot; it describes how armed criminals were squee@@ zing money from their business month by month , until they destroyed not only the business , but also tore their family apart .
you think about everything that you have lost and how many people can completely change your entire life in just a few days .
the pain never passes , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the far@@ ther we are from each other , the better .
she concluded with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kidn@@ ap you or kill you .
in these horrible days I asked if weeping would dissolve my deeply rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega has published the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing wife and a man murdered by organized crime ?
what is it like to grow up in a settlement on the edge of Mexico &apos;s most dangerous city ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he tells him to teach himself how to cook an egg , keep potatoes , keep tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years before , when he was only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody cor@@ p@@ se of his father who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , as a force through organized crime and the struggle against the existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of mur@@ ders according to the Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Council for Public Safety and Government of the Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office had 3@@ 103 kill@@ ings . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 hours per day .
these are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of stories behind organized crime in Mexico and which inv@@ ade the soul of the country .
only a few stories still live in the face of new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co 2015 launched the journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trade , which has tor@@ mented the country in the last four decades .
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ MENT : this article and the pages to which he links contains pictures on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to lifting a rum@@ or or to un@@ mask a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the years after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or false , tends to per@@ sist .
take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to illustrate trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false link between picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful coverage of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
it raises questions about our desire for images to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker crossed the town S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted and explo@@ ded . 230 people lost their lives .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been neglected for years and thus devast@@ ated . the roads in the region became dangerous path@@ ways full of po@@ thol@@ es , which were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , the tank car fell victim to it .
public authorities described a fire@@ ball that envel@@ oped dozens of houses , including a cinema nearby which was full of people watching the World Cup .
houses scattered and char@@ red cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to the unknown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That is Nigeria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Im@@ g@@ ur User My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies that are str@@ ung on the ground while people watch them .
but here the story does not come to an end .
over the years the same photo was copied several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms and fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses drastically reported atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one left to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a resident of Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be depicted visually .
the attack was also un@@ solved , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Congo emerged again , as it was wrong@@ ly presented as evidence of the fact and potential extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of false attri@@ butions ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the picture was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings .
one step further , personal comments , such as this example fal@@ sely link the image from the DR Congo to sources of mass media in order to provide arguments .
the image from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persec@@ utions of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a lightning announcement , published by the United Nations described those who could flee could strike , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported on the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts appeared like the following who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page , which was fal@@ sely claimed by Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ ein Sein , monks and politicians had participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate this information .
the original contribution , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news agencies called AF@@ P as their source had fal@@ sely attributed to Th@@ ein the statement , but had not related the image from the DR Congo .
the global reach of false information
traces of these false dec@@ ou@@ pling date back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the help of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse picture search &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; one can see how far information can transc@@ end boundaries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures , which are very similar to the said picture from DR Congo .
they come from a mix of private pages , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed wrong reports , some have tried to expose fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have del@@ ine@@ ated examples of impro@@ per use and associated them with the respective countries , on the basis of which page they were published . by doing so , we want to portra@@ y the range more clearly than by language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases were also inter@@ connected ) , several examples may be used for impro@@ per use .
here are some cases that can now be completely flus@@ hed out ( on the orange map ) :
map : News Fra@@ mes .
case studies of false copies of the picture from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange coun@@ ties point to pages or servers that are still available for counter@@ fei@@ ting or false messages .
the grey countries are examples that , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ Eye , are likely to show fake examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what is happening in Burma ? &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of the Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

Canada , 2015 .
in this article , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City not only acknow@@ le@@ dges the false message , but also discusses the mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions about the intentions of the persons and the trage@@ dies involved in it ( in DR Congo and beyond ) .
Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ án qu@@ em@@ ando a los cr@@ isti@@ anos &quot; ( In Nigeria they burn the Christians ) .
in this article about explo@@ sions in North @-@ Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , the district is identified as the Christian part of the place .
La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica quotes as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( although it is not known whether the original report contains the picture ) .
France , 2015 .
T@@ wit@@ ter@@ ies following the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am , like this one , who used the picture from the DR Congo to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam , &quot; have clearly seen no sides like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster that refu@@ te this .

Iran , 2012 .
an association of students of theology ( mul@@ lahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims on the news agency N@@ asi@@ m and used to illustrate the picture of the DR Congo .
Italy , 2015 .
an inhabit@@ ant of the old town P@@ ie@@ di@@ ca@@ stell@@ o von Tren@@ to posted this message to his side in order to express his solidarity with the massacre in Nigeria in 2015 .
Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo from the DR Congo was shared as proof of the bom@@ b@@ ings of B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of an ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo , with one on the one hand a twe@@ et expressing sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are prosec@@ uted , because the photos were used impro@@ per@@ ly .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government published a correction of what they came to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intentionally fin@@ alised news and photos that came to international media , international human rights organisations and governments &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings in Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this judgment , which was published exclusively in English , also contains references to fake images of rum@@ ors that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech run and use by extrem@@ ist groups to demonstrate that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often spread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
Russia , 2012 . &quot; smoo@@ thing relief &quot; ( hyper@@ cholester@@ emia or political provo@@ cation ? ) .
this post , addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims killing Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar had granted Th@@ ein Sein 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and the picture is still included in this release .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am published by the now deleted , the Catholic nearby news site An@@ á@@ lis@@ is Digital , has expressly stated that the image does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture later went into circulation in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ov@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) .
the picture of the DR Congo emerged with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted their communities to pay greater attention to these events , which took place in the name of Islam .
USA , 2015 .
the image was twe@@ aked as evidence of the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 ( and saved more than 9.@@ 300 times ) , but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Vietnam@@ ese ) , 2014 .
after a message allegedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums such as this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it fal@@ seh@@ ood .
from the message in which the picture from the DR Congo was included , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ in@@ ese mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos detached themselves .
there are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
the Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , the Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China are no longer fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the Web@@ craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names associated with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which first appeared clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may ultimately have a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and Images
here are two strong topics or frames ( fra@@ ming ) that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the mur@@ ders of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued in comparison to a European or French life .
understanding religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with social media there are tens of people who un@@ intentionally share the water around a tragedy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
does this mood of false and false information suggest that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and dimin@@ ish the actual hor@@ r@@ ors of what actually happened in DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the distribution of violent pictures has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
one argument is that rej@@ ecting images of a refusal to recognise the tragedy is to recognise the tragedy . sometimes these images are even required by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images sensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and viewers to emp@@ athy and emp@@ ower them to emp@@ athy ( such as this study that investigated how violent media work to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss about violent portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
technologi@@ sts try to experiment with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which an image suggests something , which can actually be derived from context or completely ab@@ u@@ sive .
however , any investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons uses according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. inv@@ alu@@ able ) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or impossible to translate at all .
there are such words in every language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these inv@@ alu@@ able words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese Saudi ) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture ( such as the Spanish so@@ bre@@ wing ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or phrase is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context are needed to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected in an online list for a whole period of time .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
for example , in the blog you can find words from Van@@ u@@ atu , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - take care of your parents in recognition of your efforts in your recent years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ elling language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that one feels after being war@@ med in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog about :
they def@@ y other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page even more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable words &quot; and show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speakers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are treas@@ ured by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst floo@@ ding in the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ ding and floo@@ ding catastrophe in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally uses the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have stepped over the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
according to an opinion from the cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ al centre of Sri Lanka from May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missed because of the floods and mud winds .
over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people were killed in 304 safe places of hab@@ itation .
rain falls on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas declined slowly .
health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ a city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s le@@ thal escap@@ es wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue fever crisis , warns Save the Children after more rainf@@ alls are already on their way .
this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in high water , water level up to 6 meters . the village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded due to the water level of Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a , which survived yesterday .
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and further five are made for the transportation of emergency deliveries to the residents included in their flooded villages .
different organizations and startups are also ready to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood conditions and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call today the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
the taxi @-@ call app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app , so that the cat@@ ast@@ oph@@ en@@ ic centre is informed .
last year following the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle for pick @-@ up services and donations . these were then forwarded to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross for free .
they also introduced a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which resulted in more than a thousand en@@ quiries and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floods and land@@ slides .
the unified efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring security and aid to people in need .
this has prevented the loss of further human lives , with the population of Sri Lanka the long way to restoring norm@@ ality .

the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January , I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and dear friend .
I confi@@ de to her my four years old daughter , she entru@@ sts me with her children : she is my rock in the surf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in one minute we still call slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the next one we channel rights for trans@@ gender .
we are located in a sea of umbrellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with a head@@ sc@@ arf , bound from an American flag , others chant slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has developed in their conception .
they reli@@ ed me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not all look alike .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves with being a Muslim in different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , as I do not fit into it , will be dis@@ car@@ ded .
to be dis@@ car@@ ded
I don &apos;t stand alone with it .
this even happened to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which images come to mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an orthodo@@ x Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were the center of his poetry until the day he died .
but in the Western concept , religion has been er@@ ased , as well as from the most popular translations of its poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a great deal of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist , Edward S@@ aid , under@@ min@@ ed the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures still stand out today .
our politicians , the news and Hollywood industries continue to ste@@ er them .
I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , fla@@ wed narr@@ atives dominate our news@@ feeds .
this narrative over@@ shad@@ owed the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the US couldn &apos;t even choose their first female presi@@ dency candidate in 2016 .
this narrative is failing to acknowledge that if French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings , and Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women by their government are forced to cover their entire body , both of which are two sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong nar@@ ration weak@@ ens Muslim women who perform movements for change .
it is obvious that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who were brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has taken our collective imagination so deep and fla@@ wed that often Si@@ kh men and children are often the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
the 1.7 billion belong to the
in the news industry we do more than just telling stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the tri@@ pod of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here where seven million Muslims form the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ sto@@ cky Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims are among the first @-@ generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .

four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then , when Khan re@@ invented the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ challenged Muslims and Americans .
but am I now a Muslim and an American ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say instead of getting out of my Muslim recipes , or my handy hand@@ ker@@ chief that all Muslims carry with them - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I &apos;m kid@@ ding , we don &apos;t carry all T@@ ash@@ k@@ ites with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t have to be a the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be chosen almost always for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islamic refin@@ ement machine with don@@ ors , think tanks and experts for false information , which have manipul@@ ated our er@@ ron@@ eous image of what a Muslim is , or of what Islam is .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is more than just a stranger who breaks the veil on a woman .
or as the frigh@@ tening map of attacks on mos@@ ques across the U.S. , see below .

Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ugly forms attacks our belonging .
it attacks our identity that is so widespread , so versatile and complex that it cannot fit into a drawer .

I would like to explain that .
I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was born into my imagination when I was four years old in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they refer back to the following terms : belief , behavior and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbour , would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslims if she could see through the 15 meter concrete and air separating our houses .
she would see the annual ritual with my daughter if I hold her in my arms and whis@@ per her the Arab verses to the protection that seal the Qur &apos;@@ an and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim faith is always part of my shadow .

use approved .
belonging to me is the image of my mat@@ ernal grandmother with her sisters ; how they gain a competition of art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi for decades ago .
it is the picture of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and incomplete paintings of old Su@@ fi saints ; and a Qur &apos;@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can hardly mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be Muslims means to speak the prayers that she had told me to speak when I have a bad day .
to be Muslims is how they taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , which means God , my only Lord .
for a people who - for centuries - was colon@@ ised by an &quot; Empire &quot; which a company founded with the name hon@@ orable British Ost@@ ini@@ ster @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord .
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
belonging means growing up and hearing that men do not we@@ ep , but at the same time see that my immig@@ rant grandfather cries .
in the meantime , while writing books about modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an cried out for his family in the K@@ ash@@ mir family , which he had not allowed to close to his arms in half a century .
belonging to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , like my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists , who shared the Muslim world as at the game risk .
to be Muslims means knowing that in the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; col@@ oni@@ zed &quot; all up to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was dropped over a Muslim country a century ago .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mir@@ i sub@@ tan of the British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mos@@ que in England .
before there was planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

belonging to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion goes back deeply into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops station@@ ed across each continent aside from Antar@@ cti@@ ca , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that if a tragedy hits the United States and the susp@@ ects is wearing a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ ination attempt .
it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first call of prayer called Az@@ aan was called by a liber@@ ated black slave named Bil@@ al .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago , an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim B@@ an .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life counts .
being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist means to fail to communicate the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple hy@@ ph@@ ens , but fail to communicate them to others .
the narrative of the 1.7 billion bears more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reduced branch of &quot; us &quot; against &quot; it . &quot;
to be a mother means to take care of my child and all the Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people set up structural anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in the Muslim registr@@ ations that were started with President Bush and extended under President Obama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it exists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it exists in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that en@@ closes its borders with people from just the countries that bom@@ bard it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ F@@ ly list &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that largely targets Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars that we carry and the bombs we throw off on Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from the Nor@@ th@@ western University showed participants a scientifically in@@ accurate picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale ranging from 1 to 100 as regards evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversations that we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deeply dar@@ ing to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are standing back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the fla@@ wed and dangerous prints we get in our news editorial offices .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast See Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ el@@ o Square on black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sch@@ ust@@ ers Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increase Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope .

col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned about this difficult global timing that we are in .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet are now leading the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
a few years earlier it had not yet been given ; now , they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now , but who today made me an unden@@ i@@ able Muslim .
things I left here like a bread @-@ crow@@ ning track in my speech .
things that ar@@ ouse memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that make up our humanity , a story may l@@ ur@@ k where someone is being made a &quot; other . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversations within the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia occur .
more than a hundred ac@@ adem@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are w@@ aged and people will be enth@@ ron@@ ed by the creation of the &quot; other &quot; in the public performance , even scientist Stan@@ ford himself four decades ago .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of this , consciously and un@@ consciously to consoli@@ date the &quot; other . &quot; as my friend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation we have no president feeding the chocolate cake as he already bom@@ bed broken countries and &quot; to other made &quot; people goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urban language diversity
stories told by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) initiative , the en@@ umer@@ ation of stories in their original language is a possible answer to this .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the linguistic diversity of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already carried out events since 2015 , there is a risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
for the makers of the project the following applies :
the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that assume diversity - safe spaces where residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening frequently is often associated with understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen to appreciate , feel , touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers present their story in their own language and then translate or interpret them in English .
even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their devotion and their presentation lead to the fact that the audience is insi@@ sting on it .
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional history from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ ara tells the fa@@ bel from the rab@@ bit and b@@ abo@@ on in the language of Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; after explaining the importance of his f@@ able , John Ny@@ am@@ ara asks : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a wide gr@@ in , he shares his feeling of inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot; &quot; &quot;
you listened to it !
they were alert ...
they were all with me !
so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers are hoping to expand this . anyone who is inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own stor@@ y@@ telling tours .
Puerto Rico claims US re @-@ determination of sovereign debt
with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounts to 72 million US dollars , several religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration on April 3 , 2017 . the march commen@@ ced with Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civi@@ c front for the re @-@ examination of debt ) and the ec@@ centric church meeting of Puerto Rico .
the interc@@ essors of the re@@ establishment of the debt have also filed a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Rico are calling for politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for the debt to be held ac@@ coun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for financial scrut@@ iny and a management committee without personal interest in public debts , with a fixed working condition corresponding to our working conditions , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not choose between education and health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to reconci@@ le themselves with declining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not integrated into the state alliance integrated territory of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
for this reason , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; an independent non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility as an alternative to the existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico necess@@ it@@ ates a large restructuring of the state infrastructure .
measures imposed on the outside will be je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed without the participation and conviction of citizens to be rejected by the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration carried the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night Vi@@ gil of Light and Truth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .

more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on digital culture that is held in Berlin , an event dedicated to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign was dedicated .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the French @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , managing director of Book S@@ prints , a publishing house published by so @-@ called &apos; book S@@ prints &apos; , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Research ) .
the book published last year and published here is a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression .
it &apos;s a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it means :
this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built and what are the real costs associated with it .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to release Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ m , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was removed from the list of the A@@ dra prison in which he sat on October 3 , 2015 .
we have since then no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom immediately .
seeing that Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has let many of us start thinking about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we decide for ?
what have we given up in this process of temporary extreme convi@@ ctions ?
since March 2012 , the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody by Syrian government authorities .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military establishment , to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer , N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police &quot; Bass@@ el had taken part in a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by individuals who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
his place of residence and condition remains unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ sels &apos;s cultural prototypes was more pro@@ active than the work he began with a group of arch@@ e@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually recre@@ ate the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civil@@ isations and here Greek @-@ Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time , Bass@@ el was not able to know that ten years after he began this work , the IS would put everything on it , this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project until now .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life of dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English even when he was already in jail .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who has asked . he has taught other det@@ ain@@ ees to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of waiting ( waiting ) , a commission which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in prison .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together on the book for a year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English .
the book is available roy@@ alty @-@ free .
book cover by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here is an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It Happ@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens at every visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose my mind at the moment we embrace ,
that each of the dangers is no matter ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards
I forget the tower of the prison
and I enter into every detail of your voice and words
which I carry with passion with me ,
if your eyes say good@@ bye
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I return quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to bring back all the moments ,
and about your absence to cry and smile .
I bear witness to myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the detention of Bass@@ el G@@ haz@@ i wrote :

while at the same time
I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage of the monsters
Bas@@ le &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
since the protests in 2011 against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights .
those arrested , or disappeared under the use of force by the regime , were tor@@ tured or even executed .
by 2016 , according to the international human rights organization Am@@ nesty International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in prison .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we reiter@@ ate our call in the hope that we must do this for the last time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Moz@@ ambique : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to corruption sentenced director to release after release on previous post &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moz@@ ambique re@@ acted with anger to an ab@@ rupt fall in which a government member returned after half his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus where corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years imprisonment along with four other defend@@ ants because of the im@@ purity of 54 million me@@ tics ( about 800 000 Euro ) .
the money came from public money from Moz@@ ambique airports , the Council of which Cam@@ ba@@ za ruled between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good lead and immediately called for his res@@ etting to the company , which happened on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which evaluated the motion , there would be no reason for Cam@@ ba@@ za to rel@@ inqu@@ ish his old post as the company did not carry out disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment .
however , many inhabitants do not welcome the action .
in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned the decision of the company to resume its director :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and exemp@@ li@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step backward with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we are aware of is that also the firm should have introduced a disciplinary action against the contrary .
the company apparently kept silent and did not take appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ can social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent guy , he would be a consultant , after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which served .
he could give paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has cons@@ ented to be integrated into the company , which he has helped to inflic@@ t damage .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence .
un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambi@@ an and student of political science in Brazil says , the director does not have any mor@@ als : &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him . I can &apos;t believe that you are rewarded in such a way that has already insul@@ ted the state so massi@@ vely .
Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks to return to morality and to serve the state , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served himself in the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself became tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ t pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief is in prison :
thi@@ eves belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mah@@ el and will not only remember the Moz@@ ambi@@ ans as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , ed@@ ging and - by the way - proph@@ etic utter@@ er .
one of his most famous verbal depic@@ tions was when he confirmed vigor@@ ously that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of everything , including the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions to sell his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that this is not the case . he changes tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious human being is at the same time criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he was sitting for 10 years and was released .
and today the company , in which he in@@ jects any money , res@@ ets again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ α@@ ¤ ir@@ k ( @ az@@ mal _ Ra@@ fik ) 12 May 2017

in fact , being in # Moz@@ ambique th@@ ief and servant of # F@@ rel@@ imo , pays off . # Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , sentenced to a long time in prison , returns to # Air@@ ports of Moz@@ ambique - E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo ( @ E@@ mil@@ do@@ sam@@ bo ) 11 May 2017
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ its . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East India or generally used as adj@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook uses the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cal@@ ves &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of the hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely degra@@ ding con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that posts where they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubt for their use have been cens@@ ored .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with different mean@@ ings that have the same letter sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , the chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spl@@ itting b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ei@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ kn@@ ä@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way , if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a p@@ un .
the sentence ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) in Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is of the opinion that it will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be analytical before it extingu@@ ishes all posts that are suspected of spreading rac@@ ism .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Fac@@ t@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the words opposite .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty Nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , receive a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise her nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who dis@@ semin@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat showed that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby social networks simply start using a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new policy of Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was banned from posting , posting and sharing content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; did not meet the Facebook Community standards . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions on hate speech of radical nation@@ alists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook removed .
in the post , the author shared his opinion on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism are bad in the country .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asking for advice :
Facebook likes to have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through its platform , but it doesn &apos;t work like that .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden words like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied posts .
if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover , that would be great .
Facebook automatic cens@@ orship caused a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which did not contain hate speech , but were nevertheless removed :
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads : &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .
just to check if Facebook removes the mail containing the word &quot; Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks aims to inc@@ ite violence in the communities of Myanmar in addition , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised for its failure to control the ramp@@ ant hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese sides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have looked better in context than initiatives focused on code and learned from them .
in Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is the end of the marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .

the inf@@ ant is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law bann@@ ing this practice so that the age @-@ able age is now 18 .
in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the Inter@@ religious Organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group representing representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere since the age did not determine the maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contract partner of the UN Convention on Children Rights , the min@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every man under 18 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were married to 15 were 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and with 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 from 1997 to 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements , which ende@@ avor@@ ed to abol@@ ish laws on child marriage , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this outcome .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about saying the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this un@@ complicated cause , and at some point , doubts arose whether the opposition would agree on the bill in general .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill against child marriage was resolved - despite four sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent one who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him the law .
now only the President of the country has to agree and proclaim the law .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against child marriage was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and none of them decided against it .
after it was decided in the Senate before , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media users were thrilled because the laws on child marriage had finally been changed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Education in the Ministry of Education &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it took too much time and unnecessary talk that has disgu@@ ised the heart of the matter , but do you know what ? it &apos;s illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and it &apos;s worth almost every price .
while Abel was of my opinion , it would definitely take long enough to practice the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was happy that the day had finally arrived :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : News !
the law of marriage has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for this - 0 on the other hand ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group , who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted :
the age @-@ able age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft on the amend@@ ment of the spouse was decided today , on June 9 , 2017 .
there are 41 members in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 were present during the vote .
all the dep@@ u@@ ties agreed to have voted for the law .
it is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # Mal@@ marri@@ age@@ d@@ abuse .
many thanks to all activists who have fought him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our dep@@ u@@ ties .
but a possible catch comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj therefore , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organisation of the country .
months ago Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take legal steps , the law should be passed , and he seems to be able to deliver his promise now .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Paris Al ra@@ wi , an advoc@@ ate of the law , said it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , most social media users wanted to address the debate on the subject differently .
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
instead of talking about the problem , instead of talking about the problem that the state , our daughters prevents them from being ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are in advantage of them , would you be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to a legal action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where the child marriage in different gra@@ dations is legal or still the norm , although there are laws that under@@ line it .

mirr@@ oring web pages allows Turkish users to view Wikipedia content again
the Wikipedia page in English was presented on 18 January 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the USA , internationally obsc@@ ured .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month Turkey has now blocked the popular and popular En@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia principle based on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle .
day after day , it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series resist the blocking .
although many tech sav@@ vy Internet users are used to using b@@ ypass tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has since 2008 locked articles from Wikipedia , as described recently in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ings of the Internet have been taking place since 2007 , after the Internet Law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
according to China , Turkey is the second most known country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , there are now several mirror sites ( pages which mirror the contents of Wikipedia and often updated ) .
one solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) when the platform put all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its distributed pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. calcul@@ ator @-@ machine connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
however , the content is accessible despite legal prohibition .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS talks about his efforts :
after we &apos;ve heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we set everything to put Snap@@ shots from Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , there is the possibility to read the contents in a decentr@@ alized and distributed way .
this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cr@@ isti@@ an Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a mirror site from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors sites if locked in the respective country Wikipedia .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member and staff at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a mirror .
you access another URL that is not the original . that which you see then is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server further guides the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey .
for this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation

photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ ry with poorly positioned motifs and balanced colors .
this motivated him to carry a camera himself and to try to bury the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nepal &apos;s wildlife to the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , gives him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class location helps him with his work :
I live on the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti River a le@@ op@@ ard would be .
the river em@@ bank@@ ment is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately began to kin@@ dle pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for N@@ ept@@ une nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he should know it , for he was already face to face to Tig@@ ers :
a tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep when sleeping ! !
late evening . the light is too weak .
bed@@ time for all animals and birds .
also I was at home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the boy appeared . he sat down immediately , we see us and he star@@ es me through the sc@@ arf @-@ trees ! !
&quot; &quot; &quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I click for conservation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on its photos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , his passion for the promotion of N@@ ept@@ une nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , mostly living in a tent to make pictures of Ot@@ tern at Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation .
see below some of these photos .

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international media organisation from India .
a revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , it is possible to avoid women with the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that due to social pressure they should respect the husband , as well as fear of the consequences they should respect the norm , keep this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was con@@ vic@@ ted by the Indian State of O@@ dish@@ a by a criminal court and viol@@ ated by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married relative with her name .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives also not by name is common among men . however , they have much less fear to fear if at all which ones , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and became the main theme of the city .
it is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and advoc@@ ates for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to expose practices such as children &apos;s marriage and the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected individuals , and lead those clubs .
she reports on how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them amb@@ ass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion group dealt with women who did not call her hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
not to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands as loud is a custom that they all held ac@@ coun@@ table and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is regarded as a dec@@ eit@@ ful woman , as a woman without mor@@ als .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion round .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try out at home as it is going .
she showed the video of the discussion round of her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was over .
Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned around and said I should call him from now on his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started the first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to initiate the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to express the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving , and so on .
then she asked all , &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want it means that they don &apos;t respect us ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on breaking a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women are never allowed to speak the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
a woman was so shy that she walked just before her during the whole exercise ; another decided to release the entire fru@@ stration against him and his family by cursed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in the adren@@ alin rush of having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands at home .
and they kept their word .
in the coming days , Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put into the head of women : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she got sc@@ ared and said it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini meant I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation started violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the zin@@ ced red dot on the forehead that shows the marriage status :
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would wear the zin@@ ced red dot when he did it .
he only laugh@@ ed and I stopped wearing it .
the other women have not completely stopped , but think they are in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the Dis@@ cussion Club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip with every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they danced and sang and talked about things they never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years now and yet I have never been so hon@@ estly speaking about some things , for example , how our identi@@ ties are linked to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say things out loud , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothes .
some women in the group have only worn sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most , this is okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ ine @-@ kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a trousers ; they did not dare .
after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of the own dress code , the mor@@ als linked to the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled their own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion group so that the women could wear them .
next , they decided to go on a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will manage it .
on the question of whether something changed in the five months since their first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are coming slowly :
so far we have only made small steps .
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped saying the name of their husband .
some , including myself , do it , but only if they are alone and there are no other family members .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at all times .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or the choice of clothes - lie at the end of a heavily navig@@ ating river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini declares :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am also .
but this club gives each one of us the confidence that something is going to change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

the first Japan visit of the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commemor@@ ative day
the Beat@@ les during their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
on June 29th this year the h@@ ash@@ tag was to be held in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post@@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 , noticed in 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just about five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this has been enough to let the Japanese go through .
the people here became quite quickly clear that they had no other choice than to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the individual trade giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
good morning ! today is the Beat@@ les memorial day in Japan .
also today songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools .
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll is supposed to represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
and as it is for fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the well @-@ known places associated with the band .
if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places that you absolutely have to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Matthew Street ( Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( From the Link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be qu@@ ir@@ ky enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the film K @-@ On were on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
the same thing we did last year too .
and of course , some companies also use the fan base for marketing purposes , such as this R@@ amen shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! &quot; today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
and what could this be for a day ?
today I will listen to &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya .
that is how the day will go today .
so , we hope you are there !
this is followed by the h@@ ash@@ tag , to see the Beat@@ les commemor@@ ative day .
bald men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Moz@@ ambique
the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia warned the population that bald men in Moz@@ ambique could be the target of attacks .
photo : An@@ ders Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0
a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald persons for organ traffi@@ cking , presumably for dis@@ believers , is disturbing the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambique . the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was be@@ headed and a part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and the result was that the organs of sham@@ ans were used in Tanzania and Malawi .
there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a man @-@ headed man could uncover gold or bring wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia announced the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Moz@@ ambique .
another group , the goal of mur@@ ders for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN 2016 conducted a mission in South Africa to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who are planning to travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Moz@@ ambique are aimed at ritual attacks , warned the Moz@@ ambi@@ can police following the latest assass@@ inations of three bald men on account of their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange where the mur@@ ders took place .
Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and inhabit@@ ant of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Moz@@ ambique , said the local police are already pursuing the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ pho@@ bal@@ a , province of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , for presumably super@@ sti@@ tious rituals , has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans .
in recent days three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country .
Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha said on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the B@@ log@@ gers poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Moz@@ ambique :
I M@@ UST BE a country where people would have shame to go on the street , attract them from shooting a por@@ no@@ graphic in which the teachers would be ashamed to demand sex against good marks , and to take their lives to earn their bread , a country where neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald faced for dis@@ believing purposes or &quot; black magic . &quot;
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not miss the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humor .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambique and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ted that both the head of the district Mor@@ pho@@ bal@@ a , Pedro S@@ ange and the police spokes@@ man Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moz@@ ambi@@ can authorities are very concerned about the assass@@ inations of people of many people . &quot; &quot; &quot;

we are deeply affected by the death of our friend Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ m .
we mo@@ urn for him and speak our heart@@ felt con@@ dol@@ ences to his family , friends and all those who have known and loved him .
a pioneer of Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , active in projects like Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) played a key role in expanding public access to the Internet and open knowledge .
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices community and took part in our Arab blo@@ gger meeting in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ le &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by individuals who claimed herself as an insi@@ der of the Assad government .
they reported that their husband was sentenced to death but did not pay any further information .
Bas@@ le &apos;s stay and constitution were unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials learned that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , we are doing all the work of Bass@@ el as a pioneer of the open web movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we appreciate the efforts of all the people and organizations who have campaig@@ ned for his release in the last five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against the regime of Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , such as the Syrian Network for Human Rights .
countless of those arrested by the regime were subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 no less than 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have come to death in custody , such as the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International .
the fate of many people remains unknown .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he had been hospit@@ alized due to liver cancer in the terminal stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state risk ) , having participated in the draft Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that demanded democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ us case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal affair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and told a spokes@@ man , he considered it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China continues to release calls from the international community , Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to allow him a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
a spokes@@ man , however , refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad .
Norway , Norway
Norwegian Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about licensing .
the relationship between China and Norway came to a stand@@ still after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that it ultimately has nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume exports to China , since exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union - European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to release Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and to allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China for the release of Li@@ us , as announced in a statement on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family members .
they should meet and receive all visits they wish and able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad announced that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him that he has the possibility of treatment abroad , in so far as it helps him with his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the US embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced on June 27 that the embassy requested the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest .
the U.S. Embassy promp@@ ts a fur@@ ious response from China , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley announced that China should offer the couple the following :
protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice , to which they are entitled according to the Chinese constitution and legal system and international obligations .
the U.S. sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .

Germany and Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; German government spokesperson Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , that Li@@ u receives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on July 7 and 8 at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reu@@ ters that China had great concerns about whether the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada and Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called on China to provide Li@@ u with appropriate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u &apos;s lawyer told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to speak and contact someone outside , including his lawyers .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells us :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada ur@@ ges China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to release those engaged in the exercise of these rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
France , France
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Foreign Ministry of France urged China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons in an explanation : &quot; &quot; &quot;
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where he needs . furthermore , his wife and family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there would be no further information whether France would eventually take it .
Taiwan , Taiwan , China
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of mainland China in Taiwan prompted China to release Li@@ u and show a greater tolerance towards those who advoc@@ ate peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature , Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u , of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party , also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama and the Dalai Lama
the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned with Li@@ u in an explanation on June 28 , stating that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and was severely punished for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn had contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and concerned citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who signed charter 08 that stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may seem sil@@ ly , since Singapore is internationally recognised as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city .
this remark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York , the Minister noticed that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries .
he supported Singapore to be considered a city .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people commit a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land , it is said that we are ultimately not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar that it had the appearance of a flight in front of the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of that , he appeared in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic .
in contrast , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities which are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core of the topic , the good old ly@@ re emerges from the author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , leaving the twisted logic because it fits better to their power .
in the end , the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam gave answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system , really non @-@ answers .
he disgu@@ ised such questions with non @-@ answers of rational nature .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow .
if Singapore is not a country but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clarify this point , provided that it was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points out the reviews that one should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference , so that the context of the statements made by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam could be better understood , according to which Singapore was a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore were so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party win for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who is the leader of a growing generation , who makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - do I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of the Singapore political leaders , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes this is really associated and aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ covers the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faith@@ fully commit a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only viewed as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , which country will the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
since he plays an important role within the cabinet &apos;s cabinet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of grave importance .
why do the people of Singapore do their military service , they only defend their city but not their country ?
who has to pay our Prime Minister bills back ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journey of a Dec@@ ade &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ten@@ ding to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore , and was always a city : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have anger@@ ed many people of Singapore ...
no one ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country especially &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; etc . , but that is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defence of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked recently its editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect in your home or homeland ?
their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with the rum@@ ours about certain parts of the world exposed and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question asked me most in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I have been living and returning to Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation in which the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his convers@@ ational partner by asking personal questions .
my clari@@ fication is usually followed by the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans might cook in anger when they are kept for Americans , but that doesn &apos;t bo@@ ther me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that distinguishes us Canadi@@ ans from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans bring a Canadian flag to their back@@ pack when they travel .
all lovers of Canadi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand , ... .
so it was already when I began to travel through the world twenty years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried little map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously often say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant nation against ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends whom I admire very much .
I wouldn &apos;t mind if I would conf@@ use myself with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first of all : being a &quot; nice &quot; means to be sk@@ inn@@ y - just like the gentle , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The S@@ imp@@ sons &quot; ( who has his own Canadian doubles . ) .
if Canada really is a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing that one can encounter .
to be harmless is to be in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and to earn no attention .
this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from the things that happen around you .
I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free and alone is a main feature of Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to care only for our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps is simply cool pol@@ it@@ eness . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence over the fence .
we lack the warm@@ hear@@ ted , open @-@ hear@@ ted kindness that I am now joining with my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau went on stage to show Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot;
music video of a pop band par@@ ano@@ des Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
a pop @-@ band , famous in Thailand , has released a music video that par@@ odi@@ ans the Jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 and , despite their promises to restore civilian government , continues to dominate the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new song &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells the rules his girlfriend does . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although not politically politically , the music video refers indirectly to the continuing military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
in the first three days alone , the video uploaded to Facebook 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times was shared and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin Video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as regards the country &apos;s position under the Jun@@ ta regime .
take a look at these videos of the video , which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has pursued in the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army total decision making about important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious programme of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amend@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are viewed as critics of the jun@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crimin@@ ality , whose vag@@ ue and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army , which monitors online content and prosec@@ uted individuals accused of being slan@@ dered by the monarchy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thailand employs a strict &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Most Great &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Maj@@ estic Skin &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later , it came to a put@@ sch of the army .
one of the problems the jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van before putting them into intern@@ ment camps , another problem .
some journalists are imprisoned because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long sentences if they off@@ end the monarchy .
meanwhile the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band who im@@ itated the sal@@ ute from &quot; The tribute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by coup opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life goes on in the ruins of the ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war society slowly reco@@ vers in East @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
more than 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ gor@@ an war officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ vil@@ ava are located in the coal basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Central Asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the Soviet era .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , mostly Russians and rab@@ bits live in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
in pre @-@ war years more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people , after barely a decade had passed .
in 1989 , about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s which are called K@@ hr@@ us@@ h@@ chen@@ ko are symbolic of the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are deca@@ yed and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it is difficult for him to finish this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nonetheless unique . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were municipal centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all of which served the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded glory buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planned economy of the Soviet Union have meanwhile left the district .
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha about fifty inhabitants live .
approximately 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ us@@ h@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas that house one or two families can be seen on the balconies where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in their hand , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother for@@ ba@@ de us to let us photograph , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why then ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal consumption ) such as livestock farming , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation .
it &apos;s hard to get around the rounds .
the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages in winter .

about ten years ago an older woman with the name Gal@@ ina ( or A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) moved from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite her el@@ dest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave before Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly rent are just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells us that they and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

if you are looking for a holiday , please visit us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we can &apos;t do it all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ asha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s conversation partner Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ asha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day they remember the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia simply broke off ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take some time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha holds about $ 9 child benefit for each child .
her husband works in the carbon pit .
the young family has their own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten once was , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chi@@ ckens .
she tells us that it was a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time , she lost her anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and everyone lived as it was right for them .
every day I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our conversation ends , a little boy runs past us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball which then rolls down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
while they run , some of them throw stones on the ruined buildings .
these ruins are a part of her childhood , which worries for in@@ consistency in her life .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez direc@@ ts a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and is published here with friendly permission .
on the way to migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 5@@ 92 @-@ year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral pink bri@@ ll@@ on frame and gold coloured earrings in ted@@ dy bear form .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Afrika .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about $ 2.@@ 50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel , but there are hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian immigrants arriving here .
sometimes , says Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez , people come to full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year , Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept on boxes outside .
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anybody .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , she bu@@ ys them medication they can &apos;t pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently .
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ call@@ i , who has a Jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ beard ) pos@@ ses with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it fits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and three children .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and move north@@ wards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Afrika is a well @-@ known name on the route , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he says that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans often travel together and that Afri@@ cans already talk to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was weakened , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Afrika is our mother and we will never leave her again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests often send text messages when they have gone to greet them or to report to her about the course of their journey .
she explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
MS Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well @-@ known here , but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have recorded migrants in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive .
he started to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a hob outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after he lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job .
the majority of migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula are from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to black@@ mail him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a single educ@@ ator , offered him her roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and tries to decide where to go the next step .
back in the House of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the cor@@ rid@@ ors , the travellers should consult their phones quietly .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part from Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who have departed .
like a proud grandmother she fli@@ ps in her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair care she has made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly , while she introduces her to me .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; you &apos;ve already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang by t@@ witter user .
the residents of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their phones .
on July 10 , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an District of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a phone notification in which they instruc@@ t the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preventing access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the Autonom@@ ous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture because they had shared messages with a private We@@ Chat group shortly after they had installed the app .
in the communication of the police , the app would identify and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network .
this app with min@@ ors filtering is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remote control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while noti@@ fications about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in the areas of conflict , the authorities often submit extreme cens@@ oring and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs .
the media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; published on Twitter , published cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where police officers checked the residents random@@ ly whether they had installed the Surv@@ eillance App .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile alert demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , it could be det@@ ained up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they forced the people to use devices intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the recovery technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images from mainland China &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , which indicates that the software can lift the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and cell phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Party Council to minimize the dis@@ semination of illegal content .
all branches of government , government and related institutions , including universities and research institutes , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office on the operation of their computers and communication devices .
a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , authorities issued a regulation on June 27 in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs , until 1 August to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the personal rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is &apos;s three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible off@@ ences , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or Death , Part 1 : all scre@@ ams after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sle@@ ep or Death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane tells his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and realize that you are all alone in a place where everything is important .
everything has gradually resolved and revealed a truth that is clearly visible both from the inside and from the outside .
one that makes all honour to their name .
one that has kno@@ cked down into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
but when reality takes you back and you look behind the scenes - beyond acting , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cries out after death .
all doubts arise in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even if the Earth is spinning on the A@@ xis of Un@@ happiness . you realize that here you are caught between the walls that your parents , and in front of them your grand@@ parents , stone have been erected around stone .
they arrested me and my father thri@@ ce , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five teenagers were torn from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest such as we@@ eds .
it was enough for the city to break the darkness of the night with &quot; Al@@ la@@ hu ak@@ bar &quot; cries .
all the districts were cov@@ eted , but not my own .
for the first time , it was still , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that is stuff@@ ed to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down somewhat after the power supply in the neighborhood stopped functioning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ la@@ hu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice disgu@@ sted by silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we al@@ lied ourselves to a glorious picture that filled my expectations with full satisfaction .
at such a moment , you are aware that you release the mind from the lamp , but it just doesn &apos;t interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my Father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military safety building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid down .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ amed it all the way to the security service office from the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me also hear how you scre@@ am &apos; Al@@ la@@ hu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are brave enough to scre@@ am when we are not close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes were on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really dare to look into my eyes and not to the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was in my fol@@ ly , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my thing when I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it right now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement and his father immediately with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father immediately with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed proposition is in my nose today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture that I had been subjected to for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I wear with myself .
then back through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I pre@@ tend to know all the details before I enter the room .
different from that , they have probably all@@ otted to me a larger cell this time .
I have to share them with one single prisoner , and I must immediately sit down without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes , feeling like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I res@@ or@@ ted to an old tried and tested method of communication : hitting the wall with his fist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell @-@ mate was an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ s@@ th@@ ä@@ ft@@ ling &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; apparently none of the surrounding cells was a respected middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the doctor &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in perfect darkness , no prominent features can be recognized by me , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator assured me that they would release him if I remain .
li@@ ar .
I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ elled on the fruits in the garden of my head .
from the distance , I still hear them crying &quot; Al@@ la@@ hu ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be approximately 10 am in the evening , always at this time the cries , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the color of corruption until I saw the yellow light that presented us to the Gra@@ il in person : the Ra@@ ad ( for example : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; all@@ u@@ ding to 13 S@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the secret was revealed : in order to protect the security of state from us and prevent that we release the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - so they played out their sec@@ t@@ arian black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow field of view of their world@@ view .
this is not a house that is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero .
I enter the inter@@ rog@@ ation room and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me like that .
he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions that der@@ ail him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than join those ta@@ xing and protest to demonstrations that will soon end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to not answering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t say exactly when insul@@ ts and blows have become an ordinary communication medium after a friendly conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , although I had nothing to earn this punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube which probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices at your cry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
give him the pleasure , you cannot compete with him and you can &apos;t hold back your cry .
my cry was not enough for him , which is why they exchanged the tube with a cable .
at my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had worked as a tr@@ ash collector before , or whether it belonged to the normal work equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables in order to present us the great invention of a giant cable from their point of view .
within a single hour three of them altern@@ ated while I was still in line .
I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er re@@ marked the cooling and didn &apos;t take any pleasure in it , which is why he acted next to an electrically loaded rod .
electricity f@@ lowed through my whole body , enough to provide my whole neighborhood .
my half @-@ naked body lying on the floor was the perfect conductor .
the de@@ af@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed , which occurred to me just like minutes .
then the call for the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with dir , Ar@@ sch@@ fu@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted adol@@ escent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must be fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and move , you will be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always freed me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smoked a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time in@@ doors ; sometimes he travels to his canvas , sometimes to his computer , sometimes even to his couch .
but what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ spotted lips .
he lives in the upper floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family to flee from their village in Palestine , in which they had lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ es ( for example : farmers ) .
for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their well @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ ture .
with his music , which often deals with topics such as orient@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man relevance , but also in cities ranging from Damascus in Syria to Yemen in Yemen .
at the age of 25 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers himself to be someone who is not limited by boundaries in his mind , and he can feel at home with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not admit it openly , he h@@ ates a special a@@ version to the US foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones has anything to do with his identity as the &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation &quot; - so he calls himself , even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine yet .
&quot; I don &apos;t think so , &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he poured into water Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam on a hot summer day .
in principle , the lu@@ str@@ e of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the squ@@ ad@@ ron of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose mainly speak of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially if you th@@ rows a look into neighbouring countries .
it is therefore easy to do basic things - just as drinking water in public during Ram@@ adan - in order not to land in prison .
recently the interior ministry of Jordan has cancelled the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front citizen Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the MP and former press spokesperson of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ ri@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been cancelled because of the singer &apos;s sexual orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , Human Rights and Freedom of Expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which places the tried @-@ and @-@ tested legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes in the entire region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la rated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive suppor@@ ter of human rights , &quot; who continue to choose &quot; for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement should probably not be simply a shallow rhet@@ oric , but in fact reflected an ever more clearly cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which appears clearly in H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b returned traditional sex men to Lei@@ be by forming his vision of the fate of Arab women who have mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently de@@ pressed unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should really trust .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , the number of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; volunteers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been accepted in Jordan - the in@@ official outside . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of volunteers reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still not@@ orious that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way .
according to a law on crime control dating back to 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; be held in prison in@@ definitely , &quot; and for their release is often necess@@ itated by years of bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee on the part of the family that nothing will happen to the woman .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known for not shy away from issues that have long been considered t@@ abo@@ o in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was informed of politics , &quot; he says .
in a song named &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b attacks the question of Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song called &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated con@@ spic@@ u@@ ously :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot;
in the course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you , in his words , &quot; get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bians and that comments on equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals were cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online programme , Ro@@ ya , to remember that his comments were torn from context , twisted and cens@@ ored in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , stre@@ amed , but only one edited version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is campaig@@ ning for the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als does not speak to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b is asking : if Abu Nu@@ die , who would later work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom it is nothing new that the government attacks attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service held several former government officials and members of the teacher &apos;s association , argu@@ ing that they had critical comments on social media issues related to the corruption that has been deeply rooted in the country .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to create a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has now denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - so it sees H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thought @-@ out and internal changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of Jord@@ anian society .
ultimately , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without any interventions from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experiencing it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness by means of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and demo@@ cra@@ cies brought about by it . at least he hopes this .
until it is so far , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and consequently resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
one susp@@ ects that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the festive carri@@ ages , the drums and dancing have been handed over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies from the west of Japan mar@@ ched into the Nor@@ theast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the em@@ iss@@ i , to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could grab a few great seats , so we have a great view .
one can only imagine how large these parts are ...
a joint venture in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo for a long time : two solid cars are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend its summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 metre high solid car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange weapons against scissors and raz@@ ors

outside appearances and personal care were rare as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like the bar@@ ber .
El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where road rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are com@@ mon@@ place .
a survey published in April 2017 revealed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) has led to the fact that more and more average citizens are entering the skilled hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that can recre@@ ate these complex hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
there experts compete against each other to show who of them can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current cont@@ ests are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school of August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found an opportunity to convince young people to trade their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to get a training in the hair@@ dressing art instead of bad advice that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered , dozens of you@@ ths have seen that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion .
before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special education workshops and reported on some of its successes :
in 1995 we were the only professional school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because from love to the children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; Love messages to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the article will be published as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel alien@@ ated ?
exactly this question left the Young @-@ Youth Foundation Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Foundation Bo@@ got@@ á and Cr@@ isti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired them to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part to this : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces ) , which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the signing of the peace agreement was considered so important that the Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services .
before the Colom@@ bians , however , there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , who have lived in illegal camps for many years , had been exposed to war rhet@@ oric and were carrying their weapons around the clock , must now re @-@ integrate into the lives of civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , which had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now record them in their ranks and support them in building up a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians had to join together and help in the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : so far , thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back into society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter - to be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for reconciliation was born at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an had the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more urgently .
he plans to share his love with people this year , which needed the most pressing interest .
thus the plan emerged to write letters full of hope and support to former F@@ ARC fighters , who now have to find their place in society and build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
so far more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camp@@ sites in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca on March 19 .
a group of 40 students of the university Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation traveled to the camp to personally transfer the letters .
members of the F@@ ARC set themselves up as they had done before to accept the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; told the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former warri@@ or led me through the camp of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters live ) I saw a guer@@ illa fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go in because next to him on the bed was a GL @-@ Gar@@ net , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing right now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; never in my life has someone written something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly tears ran over my che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ gged him and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ chers .
perhaps he was tired of the war , was tired of being the faithful companion of this warri@@ or all the years , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms .
until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new Vo@@ ices
at the beginning students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together to a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC was already in hiding .
therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state took effect on the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop a political party , we can help shape society in this country more just .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of them said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
to hear these people who have never found hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I have often seen as a monster and even hate , are only people with beautiful feelings that have been turned around by their life circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who have been killed and caused so much harm , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former warri@@ ors responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
Colum@@ bi@@ anism was prophes@@ ied that peace would reign after dis@@ ar@@ ming .
but that is not the case .
as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities exist , there will always be people who are ready to access the weapons , raise themselves and protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC are now putting on peace , a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and offer sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the foundation of existence will face many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .
a Trans@@ woman talks about the persecution in Ch@@ echn@@ ya and the life before Kad@@ y@@ rov

it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ h@@ owa and whose first publication took place on the OC Media website .
hom@@ os@@ exual and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are subject to a wide range of hazards , including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with hor@@ r@@ ors activists have witnessed the reporting of the last few months about the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat posed like a Dam@@ o@@ cl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert above the LG@@ BT@@ Q community there has not come about only overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny that shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the Republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has taken the international head@@ lines several months ago after reports have been published that addressed the dra@@ gging , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ ash@@ ina in the Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen Auth@@ orities which seized suspi@@ cious qu@@ eer men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
since her childhood she felt she was a woman in reality .
when it was grown , you became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for them , which is why they moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had learned about the gender balance of their land@@ lady , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened .
out of fear for her life , she ultimately moved to the United States .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can remove that shame ? &quot;
after that the photos of my documents made the round through the W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
I was attacked on 10 October 2015 .
when I was in the process of getting a couple of shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; here &apos;s a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you still honor the family , you scar@@ ce ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not thirty years old .
then I lost consciousness and finally woke up in the hospital .
apparently some women had everything to get along and started scre@@ aming .
the man fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two st@@ umps in my right lung .
OC Media : in which cases have you been placed - in the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
I am very thank@@ ful for that .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for being respect@@ ful of me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I received threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they asked me to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that it was all a lie .
they set absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by running through the streets without going through the streets ; others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex , that everything was just bad speech , and Phot@@ os@@ hop .
I have body size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people once said my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has damaged not only your family but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother became too much and she laid a rope around her neck .
fortunately the neighbours came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later under the window stood a car with dark window pan@@ es and a license plate with a 95 .
after it had happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something rotten .
my human rights activists checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you escape ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to disclose their names but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something unbelievable happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought them without registering , without knowing anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mo@@ m via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you are in security just because you have left the country ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
our people already know in which hotel you are stuck . you even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , that &apos;s a t@@ abo@@ o topic .
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera , I really struggle to look at the person she recalls from her past - that is , my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know anything about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for this I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who spent one and a half months in his gun .
he said that during Ram@@ adan people were not arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock a new wave .
most likely they will concentrate on family and relatives .
with this I mean , they most likely invite the relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end require proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction .
OC Media : will even now gay men be held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there wouldn &apos;t be so many .
if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to meet Kad@@ y@@ row &apos;s court .
as far as I know , they are held there so that they can later present them as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but specifically sub@@ merged to radi@@ cal@@ ise themselves .
OC Media : is this only a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard had grown .
there was nothing new from them ever since .
they just took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , that person was himself when these people were taken along .
until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , there have not been any reports yet . however , we assume that such actions are quite possible .
why would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and ab@@ duc@@ tions of people who belong to so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orient@@ ations have already occurred in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known in Gro@@ z@@ ny , when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
seriously !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was applied , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia wanted to introduce us to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but finally pushed us back to the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had tin@@ ted eyel@@ ashes , wore skir@@ ts jeans and short loops .
the Ministry of Safety of Sh@@ aria has never even cur@@ bed me a hair .
in front of the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , a whole group of people met like me .
it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been offen@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da@@ ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t laugh at the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is often said to children if they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never offen@@ ded me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten .
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov appeared on the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about morality on television .
he did not speak about us per se , but mainly about the behavior of women .
nevertheless - one could sense how the people in the city began to change .
those who laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed at first looked at you at once with suspicion .
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the Republic steadily deterior@@ ated .
OC Media : what are your activities now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , gather@@ ings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get food cards .
I don &apos;t have a cent for it for a long time .
I discovered these people myself when I cli@@ cked on refuge .
I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you carry a Hid@@ den@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that is sil@@ ly .
so nature is , it has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens who want you to prophes@@ y with foam in front of your mouth that there are no ga@@ ys with them .
the Da@@ gest@@ an have the ones who have cab@@ ard@@ ines , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet there are them - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I &apos;m from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant to hear something like that .
here I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live with men .
you know , many think about transi@@ ence to men who love men , and they believe that one is changing their sex to make more intimate experiences . but that is a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be exact , different life attitudes .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
sorry that I will be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase of suicide in the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian wine region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the local Arab population .
since the last few months there has been a strong rise in suicide .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named Y@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August gave the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , characterized by poverty and unemployment , into the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the Sou@@ thwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to arise for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who wish to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he lit himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani Hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more .
he died shortly afterwards .
it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have hung up .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government .
Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , where a large part of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran , has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the local Arab population to make a living .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy assumed power and in 1925 it under@@ took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable agricultural areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population receives little of this wealth .
it is often the victim of untreated illnesses , hunger and priv@@ ations .
the Iranian regime is systematically reb@@ elling against the Ah@@ ra@@ zi @-@ Arabs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a large number of dam@@ s , the water from the Arab areas to the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are diver@@ ted .
these dam@@ s have only managed to ag@@ grav@@ ate the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and destroy local agriculture as well as fish and palm industries .
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ ks now rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director General for Cooperation , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare reported that 5 % of Ah@@ ra@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job , completed primary school , completed 55 % of secondary school and have a 45 % university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... aimed at destroying the mind of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian human rights activ@@ ist based in London , said Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ ra@@ zi men .
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
since officials and institutions prefer not to recru@@ it Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to anni@@ hil@@ ate the spirit of national resistance among young Arabs and to force them to earn their living outside their home .
there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and thus be employed , since even Arab names at the workplace are not tolerated , let alone the speaking of the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes .
given the circumstances that Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi has to endure , human rights activists beat alert before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I don &apos;t identify with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . released under the CC@@ 0 Creative Com@@ mons License .
the following article is a revised version of the opinion published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website of A@@ fro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a feminist , many women react - especially white women who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put out well thought out scientific and soci@@ etal arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should be all fem@@ inists * in general .
for example , despite the same education , women still earn less money than men nowadays .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms always ensure that women come to a glass ceiling in various areas of life sooner or later , and that discrimination based on sex is still going through the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is aware and well @-@ known to me .
I am convinced that I will be twice and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet , when I come to skin color , on rac@@ ism , on black C@@ is women , on black transi@@ ent women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the di@@ as@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been ab@@ used physically , mentally and verb@@ ally , both in and outside the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to keep silent .
but all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; raise their voices and to sing &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord , &quot; in order to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin deserve less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want all women , all men , and all men at all to have the same rights ; on the other hand , as a black woman , I can not join a movement in which the white woman stands , who refuses to take into account injusti@@ ces in her mind , which refer to the sex as well as to the skin color of a person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am exhausted and will no longer struggle for my belonging in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined , &quot; Am I not a woman ? &quot; and I refuse to uph@@ old an ideology in which the black woman is a de@@ mented and margin@@ alised entity .
I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropri@@ ation to drive their ego@@ centric programme .
I will no longer try to close white women the importance of overl@@ apping skin color and gender , because some of them will continue to teach the importance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them for a better .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different origins a home and to distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I prefer to release myself whol@@ eh@@ ear@@ t@@ edly from femin@@ ism and connect myself to the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism that was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than setting me up for a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women in accordance with our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ ana : Rec@@ la@@ iming ( for example : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can rec@@ ap@@ ture ourselves ) speaks of the fact that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create rooms in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself of the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement that the black woman is concerned .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women of other cultures , as I exist in this paradigm .
I will be recognized as part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and my being as a woman .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life neither ski@@ pped nor ignored , nor rejected .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this paper by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports on international efforts to solve environmental problems .
in the context of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published again .
Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled again and again in the past seven years - mostly with a sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern of the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentation of E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a kid , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Water@@ lo@@ Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ scho@@ oling - who is committed to protecting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a sum@@ mar@@ ises the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a single question : &quot; if we have no more water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and published for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist based in Er@@ bil , Iraq .
the focus of her work is on neglected , un@@ noticed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques with which aid supp@@ ressed congregations can tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays women and their fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women portra@@ ys &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on the women &apos;s mur@@ ders in the country and in the region and to show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the abri@@ dged and edited version of the article entitled &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; from structural . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # ref@@ us@@ ef@@ rau@@ matic ) , which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been modified to protect the affected persons .
a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had become violent against her .
some time has passed since the end of their relationship , and the police said that their statement would be put to the files , but you can &apos;t do more .
when another Ms. Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed mal@@ treatment , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez &apos;s adver@@ t was not useful .
a few days later , the second woman with@@ drew her advertisement .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
in general , if women report an ad at all , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men whom they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit being victims of violence must be reported at all by law enforcement authorities .
content 1 impacts and statisti@@ c 2 In@@ visible acts and a legal system that has nothing to do with Paraguay &apos;s laws : good approach , faulty implementation impacts and statistics
it is hard to see how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social science research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various statements and reports , which , however , do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay &quot; explains them .
however , the numbers available are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , 9@@ 600 ads were reported to the District At@@ tor@@ ney Office on account of domestic violence . 70 % of them were violence against women .
86 % of the advertisements in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the peace courts . 86 % of women &apos;s advertisements came here as well .
in the ads , 40 % of women claimed that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an woman minister Ana Bai@@ ardi , only a few of these crimes are actually indicated . &quot; to any woman reported in Paraguay because of mental ill @-@ treatment , 9 women who do not do so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared at the end of 2014 on any woman who will be ref@@ unded because of physical mal@@ treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the murder of women in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ence , law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 , journalists numbered at least 12 cases of suicide in the country .
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , every ten days a woman dies in Paraguay because of violence by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that does not under@@ estimate
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want that , but then she gave up . she should regret her forever .
today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red mental violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognise :
I would never have thought that I would once be a victim of abuse .
when I read about it , I always thought that this only happens to women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment by Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described her insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had liked to please Carlos so long and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that the victims of abuse would have at least a certain complic@@ ity .
Victoria San@@ tos , who is not from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the Paragu@@ ay@@ an authorities to prove that their former partner mi@@ stre@@ ated them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the network &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ o te Cre@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) that is made up of women who are in any way victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victori@@ as case everything began with psychological abuse .
her prosper@@ ous partner finally managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria &apos;s advertisements with the authorities stayed without a result and also from their relatives , she received no support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she led a process against her former partner who developed into an in@@ comprehensible j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal battle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , inadequate implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the show of abuse is a way of resist@@ ances and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 a draft law was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , known as the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # for you ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this h@@ ash@@ tag and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement are part of a Twitter campaign that is supported by Am@@ nesty International . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the original bill of the law stipul@@ ates that fem@@ izi@@ d is to be declared an independent criminal offen@@ se and pun@@ ish@@ able as it is the case already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
in this way , the legislative text was changed in a number of ways in order to win the dep@@ u@@ ties of the law , which feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alization of abor@@ tions was banned , which is currently banned in Paraguay and punished with up to five years in prison .
the original bill was intended to cover most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that the victims of violence must carry themselves at present , if they simply want to make a complaint and obtain a secure accommodation to impose the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide adequate financial means for this :
in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
here a change must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal .
anyone who is silent in the face of these facts makes himself guilty and contributes to the imp@@ unity of the perpetr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must reimbur@@ se for such a long time until abuse is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate was passed . previously , parts of the law had been changed , including a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence .
opinions on the changes are taking place apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
however , the cancellation of the words &quot; sex , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is regarded as a great set@@ back .

independent media in Oman one year after the ban of a newspaper continues to attack attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was closed on the basis of a resolution of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be read on the homepage of the banned newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Venetian authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for its coverage of corruption in the sul@@ t@@ ant .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he is serving a year @-@ old prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and brought to trial , but were later released .
Oman has been reign@@ ing since 1970 by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had dismissed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
since then , in addition to his role as the only sul@@ tan , he has held the most important positions in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sultan &apos;s rule is marked by the harsh efforts of the security forces , especially domestic intelligence , to restrict the public fre@@ edoms , including freedom of the press , and torture human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists .
the authorities systematically limit human rights to peaceful and legitimate activities and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs such as corruption in authorities and institutions online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closing and detention three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which has been reported since its foundation in 2007 about corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested on 26 July 2016 an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties bind the hands of justice . &quot; this was about corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary and the interference of senior officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , government officials were accused of putting under pressure judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to impose a judgment in a dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of 26 July 2016 with a report on the cover page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties involve the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo source : Facebook page of Az@@ am@@ n
on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , member of the editorial committee , was invited by the ISS before the Special Department and arrested by the security forces upon his arrival .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS captured the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is &apos;s arrest .
the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely , after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper in any way , including online , will be prohibited from August 9 , 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i took place before the court in Mas@@ kat .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and ordered the final closure of the paper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned , inter alia , for dis@@ ruption of public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the Pres@@ ent of the State . &quot;
moreover , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of viol@@ ating a ban on the public and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years &apos; imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of 3,000 US dollars each ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year of imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of &quot; an information network to dis@@ semin@@ ate material that could represent a threat to public order . &quot;
a security deposit of $ 5000 was set for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for one year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 following his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he is serving his one @-@ year prison sentence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Appe@@ als Court also rev@@ oked the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n to resume , the newspaper still faces attacks by the Brazilian government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , with which the minister once again filed an appeal against the decision of the Appe@@ als Court to re @-@ publish the publication of the paper .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which in recent times the freedom of the press has been viol@@ ated in Oman .
other injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression is that the authorities still are not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) ur@@ ges the authorities of the Republic :
1 . free You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . under all circumstances ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman can exercise their legitimate human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ anes .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in adjacent states by promoting freedom of expression and association , as well as the right to gather peac@@ efully , and provide protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , representation takes place with his agreement
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research performed on site : on the one hand , many medicines and vacc@@ ines are missing in the global health care portfolio that cover the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more severe effects in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment in the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
secondly , research conducted by African scientists will help build their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , when the AIDS epide@@ mic revealed first serious implications for national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post @-@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus before deciding to go back home to support the S@@ á@@ mi health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about the mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( disc@@ la@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : currently the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the S@@ á@@ mi national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
I am also starting a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
CC : what do you think are the most important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always remain bene@@ fici@@ aries instead of being a creator himself .
the solutions we get are often not well usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
CC : where does the funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are funded differently .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because funding and opportunities for development are better in other countries .
GV : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work you didn &apos;t have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and the internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
CC : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools in order to improve the situation .
GV : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I &apos;ve seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special academic training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , study of space , health care ( non @-@ communic@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious illnesses ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will greatly benefit .
GV : can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa versus Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often , it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that presents challenges here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines make articles accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports on solutions to environmental issues around the world .
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding let@@ tu@@ ce in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 sorts , such as Out@@ or@@ geous , the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was set only by its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many kinds of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it for breeding .
the patents not only used for single varieties , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green ton@@ ne or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves .
over the past few years , more and more plants have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or cart@@ ons . based on this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts for food security are concerned about the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a millen@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mor@@ ton is still cultiv@@ ating let@@ tu@@ ce , but in the meantime he needs longer , since his work is increasingly difficult due to more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if in a river a b@@ oul@@ der is lying around which I have to yo@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do it now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding @-@ tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that these patents go too far for salads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand in court , no one can breed a new type of salad , because all the features are already patented . &quot; so he continues to do as good as possible and tries to breed those characteristics he wants .
however , he is very careful and tries not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the USA and all over the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red Roman sal@@ at of the Out@@ or@@ geous variety in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station . it tests whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT sector and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for Open Source seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software .
it was founded to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can thus be used permanently for plant breeders .
within the framework of the initiative called O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders can commit to the fact that others can freely use the seed bred by them .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders only allow others who purchase their seed , cross it in order to breed their own varieties , and do not immediately sow - two aspects which are banned or prescribed by many plant patents .
since its launch in 2014 , dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative .
more dark views
for the emer@@ itus professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i Management Board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants is both important for food security and environmental protection .
seeds re@@ port@@ edly play a role in larger contexts like biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to exploit the latter not or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open source &quot; movement does not concern genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grains , genetically modified or not , from organic agriculture or not . &quot; in order to reach our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed , &quot; he says , and thus particip@@ ates in the increasingly common mer@@ gers in the global agri@@ business , as it is offered in August and September 2016 . &quot; anyone who wants to buy good , locally and sustain@@ ably produced vegetables should also know that the manner in which this vegetables is bred is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to keeping their seed available free of charge . in contrast , their approach is in contrast to patent seed and plant features .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool constantly shr@@ inks due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material , which is thus always restricted .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about one third of all card features are protected as intellectual property , making it difficult for plant breeders to either not or only be har@@ med .
there are no such estimates for other plants , but experts such as Lu@@ by suggest that mass @-@ grown plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots .
a question of perception
plants are bred in such a way that they have specifically desired traits - from such ones through which their taste or colour improves to such ones , because they thri@@ ve in certain environments and endure threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties suggest that the plant material available for breeders continues to take more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more important than ever since the changed conditions are much worse due to climate change .
in an email , Mon@@ san@@ to recognizes C@@ arly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to that genetic diversity is generally important and crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity .
it contradic@@ ts , however , that intellectual property restric@@ ts other breeders because &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent exp@@ ires .
often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but encourages them by providing the public with more material and know @-@ how . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees things differently : to wait 20 years until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovations .
and if you have to wait so long to breed plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have lost the fight .
the main argument for Mor@@ ton is , however , that genetic resources have always been a general good and will continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it will be impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , Mor@@ ton interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant features : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really create the features ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plants form them themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do this .
a mystery of nature . &quot;
for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US state O@@ reg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; he who breeds a variety also breeds his own values in them .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation mass her@@ bi@@ cides are needed , are breeding in its varieties this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they manage most smaller seed companies to survive without patents - either they reject the pat@@ enting or they consider it to be too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case .

Mor@@ ton is also convinced that breeders by avoiding plant patents would be innovative : &quot; it looks as though I was stronger than companies with my efforts to produce something new .
I constantly need new material for my catalog , as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you are protected for 20 years from competition , making it very easy to believe . &quot; worldwide response
although the US seems to be a leader in open source breeding , the concept is rapidly spreading across the globe .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , carries out an &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed program . to preserve the seed of traditional crops , the centre works with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet specific requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Organization Agre@@ col works on an open @-@ source licence , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i commitment to breeders in the European Union .
( regulations for breeding differ from country to country , so that the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot be easily adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able , thus addressing the current practice of the European Patent Office which allowed patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; it is now time for the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organised a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the pat@@ enting of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; Programme for Open Source seed systems , states that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for Open Source seed systems , which will be the official launch of the official launch next year .
a consortium of environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report from aid organizations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others .
the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a diverse , local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a context that Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon recognize him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has mainly paid attention to where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is more behind their foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities are still blocking content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend around 5 August , the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world and reports on the same .
August published the network an opinion on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities sharply critici@@ zed this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains abi@@ ding in this part of the world and to give victims a voice . even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals , it has never been as important as now . AN@@ H@@ RI acknow@@ le@@ dges that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the block@@ age and not to yield . we ins@@ ist on further fulfilling our task .
AN@@ H@@ RI is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 web pages more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar @-@ based network of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era because of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;

besides AN@@ H@@ RI , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the dis@@ semination of columns and articles which he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
now the blog he set up to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government was the goal of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider of which also Zi@@ adas &apos;s blog is located , on the other hand , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 while he talked about the student protests and recorded a video of how police exer@@ ted physical violence against two students .
his articles mainly revol@@ ve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the government &apos;s closure and reflected what this means for him :
the blo@@ gs to lock is very old , however , has in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the blo@@ gging of the blog may not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) I managed to convey the feeling of a state of siege ; an arrest , a attempted murder , a charge at the National Security Council , the blo@@ gs of blo@@ gs and any other web page I worked for .
2 ) You have proven that I did not write for nothing . in other words , my words have influence , even if only to a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to post items to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship .
now , however , after blocking it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave walk the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egypt authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 6 August . this resulted in technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and ET@@ IS@@ A@@ LA@@ T .
in addition , af@@ te documented the blocking of vendors that were possible by b@@ yp@@ assing internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
Afgh@@ an reported in their research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer began .
such practice points to the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users may have access to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is also wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are taken behind closed doors , so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis through which it can proceed against these actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants fight .
the Brazilian Army was deployed in the F@@ av@@ el@@ as in Nit@@ er@@ ó@@ i , a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro , during the government crisis .

day after day newspapers in Brazil report with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves rob@@ bing pharmacy with military weapons &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tim@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers to the army , nav@@ y and air@@ far@@ away to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years in Rio .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; well @-@ known for the detailed reporting of violence in Rio on August 16 , published the Editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which she announced to set up a new column called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the paper explained the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . whatever happens in the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative , so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper stated that this decision was not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war break in a country that does not recognize the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist explains that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the newspaper writes :
we are aware that a war dis@@ courses , if it is distorted , can also be used to cover atro@@ cities of the police , which only shoots and then asks questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it uses ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira ar@@ gues against calling violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is , in her opinion , a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could complic@@ ate it to bring justice to the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated by the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historic and self @-@ compl@@ ying neg@@ lect of public service .
as a reminder , the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital .

according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro describes as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to the statistics of 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country .
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ ates per State , Rio is at number 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
extra belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , like Cec@@ í@@ lia , has been repe@@ ating the security policy of the state for years .
these security policy measures included the creation of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose goal is to capture a F@@ av@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police fire and permanently station@@ ing one unit there .
in the beginning , this actually resulted in a decline of violent death . however , for some years now , the U@@ PP was increasingly under fire after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities , which was supposed to protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux wrote from one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio will not comply with the criteria set out by the Geneva Con@@ ventions for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also ent@@ ails serious consequences for human beings .
this requires the state to use means and ways typical of a war . to this end , penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost bul@@ lets . &quot;
war back or forth , the fact is that the inhabitants of F@@ av@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio .
a week ago , the police cleared the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho in order to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besi@@ eg@@ ed Syri@@ ans learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the promotional video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops .
according to World@@ watch , a joint initiative of the Peace organisation PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege in Damascus and around the country , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b .
the East Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are assuming that the massacre of the Assad regime was perpet@@ rated on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations .
since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege , resulting in local or tunnel and control points dependent on smu@@ g@@ gled food .
due to the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and ac@@ adem@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms are not part of the traditional food eaten in Syria and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food is an attractive food source for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the right of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because you can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that for three years this project has been fighting to make this project known and expressed his relief that it now gains more and more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; famili@@ arity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da , use the humanitarian Crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ do .
it is planned to give 125 families a knowledge of planting mushrooms , &quot; says Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of approximately 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ do until Monday 04 September 2017 .
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the shortage of fuel , locally produced fuel from plastic are used to supply generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of mushroom seeds originating from regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have spread mushrooms throughout the east of Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la stated that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach man the mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : break of the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
spreading a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( like paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) for the production of new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities that are bound to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea all over the world , so that our success and our fight against hunger and siege will become visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese call for justice for the victims of fires in 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on October 21 in many District Cap@@ itals in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of fires ra@@ ging in the north of Portugal in the week .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of October 15th and 16th . this led to the government &apos;s last week out of solidarity with the victims for three days .
bran@@ dies were also registered in the Gali@@ cia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fires that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy occ@@ ured in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forest monitoring system , which monitors forest areas via satellite photographs , around 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can take a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is only a fire in 4 districts .
the whole of Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a . ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017

the Aff@@ lic@@ able Trage@@ dy
the aim of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al from the League of Far@@ mers of Portugal declared P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o newspaper :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this : there are dozens of reports of open roads surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened as in June , as the roads were locked very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , construction permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned .
a far @-@ reaching proposal for Wal@@ dre@@ form , which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law which allowed the construction activity to fall if the applicant had funds for self @-@ defence - that was an open back door so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val continues in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of easily inflamm@@ able wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , spread to fires of this kind .
in addition to these problems , the website of civil protection from Portugal on October 15 and 16 , when residents were looking for information or attempted to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that supplied the population with information : it took advantage of its own civil protection data with the application fo@@ g@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and this fat@@ eful weekend in October was so critical that the servers did not stand up to the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website counted more than half a million acc@@ esses .

one night in the autumn of 1994 , the occupation of Afghanistan began by the Tali@@ ban .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan has become a country of terror and despair .
at that time A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , was in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner .
even though his mother did not say it at that time , she knew she would not see her son for a long time - maybe even more .
in the morning , the boy was supposed to break .
his un@@ cle would fetch him and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , leader of the Haz@@ ara @-@ dominated party He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat had just been murdered by the Tali@@ ban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess .
the Tali@@ ban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ k found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was heavy and made him ill .
then he took what was left of his little wage and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country with other refugees and dra@@ gged bags with mortar which were heavier than himself to make a living .
back then , like today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; recalls A@@ shar@@ k in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site where we worked .
there was no service there and no heating . we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we didn &apos;t freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ k left behind his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities had rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ k returned to Italy in 2002 .
some time ago A@@ shar@@ k was homeless , ran through the streets of Rome alone , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy twice a day .
it is true that due to relatively high ratings , Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers . it is true , however , that the conditions for asylum seekers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; human rights organisation writes , the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the large majority of asylum seekers are housed in more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and car@@ eless personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seekers can only be allocated to an admission centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can still be applied for months after the registration of the asylum application .
until then , people who don &apos;t have money for accommodation either rely on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street .
so it was also A@@ shar@@ k .
but his mortal friend helped A@@ shar@@ k to get rid of these conditions soon .
after spending several years various works in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ k put his entire savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food .
A@@ shar@@ per Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now the subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
in 2017 the film won the Venice City Award , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lots of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to in@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years some Afgh@@ an enterprises have ar@@ isen , including tailor shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were praised even in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the peace &amp; amp restaurant in Pa@@ dua ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a Pizzeria in Bologna and a Sus@@ hi Restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ k &apos;s goals extend far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retail , and go back to the country he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where there is a risk , there are opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ k with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people suffer .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ k also designs plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packing and preservation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses in the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end there is stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ k has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans in this way .
citizen report : bills of law from Egypt allow dis@@ continuation of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in detention .
he reported about the evacu@@ ation of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , prot@@ esting against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ aca &apos;s Ne@@ tizen &apos;s Report is an international snapshot showing challenges , victories and emerging trends in global internet rights
the Egyptian Parliament reviews a draft bill that fores@@ ees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after registering with a government authority .
in order to be able to use social networks , users must register within six months of successful law decision on the authority &apos;s website stating their full name and ID number .
those who missed this step could be sentenced to six months &apos; imprisonment or the clearing of a penalty .
the law passed by sixty parliamentary members is currently facing the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May another member of the Parliament presented a legislative proposal introducing tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the insul@@ t to the president or a high officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the law proposition , such an act would be punished with imprisonment and fin@@ es , as legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law is passed , this can mean up to three years in prison for the condemned .
in addition , this would support a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years .
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photographs of violence against prot@@ esters who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , like more than 700 participants , who had been arrested at the same incident , four years in prison for a trial date .
recently , the trial laid down on 20 May was postpon@@ ed because the prison leadership failed according to human rights groups to bring the defend@@ ant from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , head@@ light on among other things weapons possession , illegal gathering , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iz@@ a was acqu@@ itted of the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were accused of their reporting to pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the sentences of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the aforementioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunisi@@ an activists to inter@@ rog@@ ated documents
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours hearing the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia has been mainly inter@@ rog@@ ated to a detailed action plan . said Plan desc@@ ends from the President of the Republic who , according to the plan , explicitly supports a controversial bill of law , which would grant business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided they return all un@@ justi@@ fiable money received .
the document published on April 21 on the Na@@ wa@@ at website th@@ rows light on how presidential plans look to support the law .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia den@@ ounced the nam@@ ing of his sources , stating article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press code , which journalists have the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he appeared in the district court in Tunis on May 09 as a witness in the case .
does China want to force the users of social media to demonstrate their identity ?
according to the new regulations of the Information Office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need a permit before writing or sharing messages in social media .
it is also stated in the Reg@@ ulations that registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts assume that this will allow the elimination of anonymous comments into conversations within social networks . it is up to now unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
Chinese citizens have proposed social media to enforce these rules only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and independence .
do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
in May the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organizer of the dis@@ semination of information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the state government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this designation is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing content and to force them on request for the suspension of user data .
these web pages currently include websites such as V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ by@@ ni@@ ks ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court decre@@ es Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court decre@@ ed Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ speaking articles , the information that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication announced that the site was blocked because it was &quot; an information source that co@@ operates with groups in order to fom@@ ent a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website . it is , among other things , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
great Britain can &apos;t stop sni@@ ff@@ ing
after this week of le@@ aked documents , Britain &apos;s government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with increased surveillance powers that would force Internet Service Provi@@ ders to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor programs that en@@ code data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence agencies regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population out@@ war@@ dly .
despite all this , the consultation is still running until May 19 . reactions and proposals from members of the public may be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .
