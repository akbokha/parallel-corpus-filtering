<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, American authors read and practiced sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was a journalist mainly because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">At the age of 14 I saw the great Denzel Washington, how he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, uncovered the murderous plot of an oil magnate, who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were willing to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free to Method Man," "" "I was as if this is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona had only reinforced my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said, "America is the only country I've ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very fanatic love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most unusual aspect of his ascension is for me, as he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">In his opinion, he never thinks behind the mountain as you say so nicely.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague put it, and openly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless people responded to his statements and agreed to him in droves.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican primaries was the highest figure ever reached by a party nominated by the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I had met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program that records people from around the world, a deeply devout person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">He did not agree with Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I had met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fought for her life for the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits the dedication of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me much in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love toward America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump paid his way to the nominees Republican presidential candidates, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The debate with the idea that people voted for trump because they either shared their racism and fanaticism or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to designate the platinum-voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To arrange the people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is superficial and disrespectful and suggests an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears over the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, voted for Trump because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, would they perhaps say that they are still important in America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commentates on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt for those who look different than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "Whitelash" "" "(N.B. Ü): as much as" "" "rebellion of the whites against all other ethnic groups" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether it is myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history, as he himself says, would never be possible anywhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election of Donald Trump, however, a huge portion of the White America promises this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this, I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">At a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd responded with a loud" "" "no!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "the crowd roared." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "did Latinos have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried, and their voices cried out louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "if someone, who is not like you, would have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and vocal "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America."</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son was fallen sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trump Land, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan could no longer find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in Oaxaca province share with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music played in both places has not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the trash</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular with tourists -but worlds apart from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now the La banda de Música (music band) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, located in one of Mexico's poorest provinces, is known for its drug abuse and gangs violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a chance encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth thus offered a rare ray of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the hustle and bustle and play the trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, french horn, timpani, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from waste</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura - a village that is practically located at the biggest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with remanufactured instruments made of local solid waste materials produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under the direction of Favio Chavez have begun to turn parts of the waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophone, trumpets, trombones and drums, all produced from the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article by the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the early times:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage. the children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a violin made of trash.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is an entire orchestra playing instruments of remanufactured material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentary called" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "(Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about one billion tons of waste every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra has even played its music in front of Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports on international, practical solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for the common use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known that this ship had already operated underground fishing in Liberian waters before it visited the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were correspondingly raised and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind at their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to grant him a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything," "" "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fisheries authority." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million dollars in Liberia, due to looting the fish stocks of the country.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal Fisheries).</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that then expelled the prime minister from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and working together. they exchange information and support each other where it is about illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending Illegally Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to track down. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing in regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By ignoring existing laws by which specific habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail speed, with the information between individual countries, the actions today are happening in real time, traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, individual countries can exchange lists of existing licences, news about suspicious activities or details that one notices or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i is also very attentive to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This makes it possible for the authorities to identify vessels that fish in forbidden areas. such suspicious routes can also be discovered - such as those indicating that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such examinations can show whether the participating vessels have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly also whether they have a penal register.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports on the basis of this information. which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo, and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then there is considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that is what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, senior director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and supports FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to gain an estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue that the eight members of the HISH-i network lost every year due to illegal fisherman invading in East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from around the world. among them also illegal fisherman.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include, among other things, actions such as sailing under false flag, fake license documents, specifying imaginary names, fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately utilise the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non-patently organized control system," "" "says Long." "" "in the past a ship could be fishing illegally and a country could then say" "" "You cannot run my harbor." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "yet another country could say" "" "Come to me." "" "and this legal loophole is trying to close FISH-i now." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">So far, the closed front is working.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspected ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used multiple fraudulent identities and it has pursued and found escaping ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crimes, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that aims to help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps to track down the illegal ships that would like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position, and that is what we try to cross," "" "says Duncan Copeland, head analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fisheries data and offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, switch off their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be located by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is therefore helping to build a system that links different levels of information. it is intended to help FISH-i to find criminals with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NGO SkyTruth, believes this.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has been opening the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oceana Marine Guard Organisation: a platform that provides satellite data and can be displayed anywhere in the world via the position of each individual tracking ship.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbours to get a better picture of who is doing what is happening - that simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and pool their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this at a global level." "" "" "" "Pew Charitable Trust has a similar project to run where a global system allows prosecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals, but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that used to be overfished without license, and hardly had to face consequences, now know that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i are now seeing a 33% increase in fishing turnover, since fishing boats have bought more licences.</seg>
<seg id="145">"" "after FISH-i Somalia had helped to track" "" "Greko 1" "", "the inspectors found there trawl nets that were banned." ""</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "we have become a study object." "" "in West Africa hundreds of millions of dollars disappear every year by illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">Six countries have joined forces in 2015, the so-called West Africa Task Force. they are also fighting illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i.. "safety is the goal of allowing even more such initiatives and structures to emerge in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently FISH-i's youngest member state Somalia was able to report its first big triumph: in October it turned Greko 1, a ship under a false flag. and not only was the ship on the way without a license and were used towing nets which are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship has also penetrated into forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they are against illegal fishing," "" "Bergh says." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special collaborative approach to protecting the oceans actually works across the oceans. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London.</seg>

<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are considered a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on president Nicolás Maduro.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela rejected the application of the opposition to a referendum on the dismissal, the Venezuelans reacted in whose eyes the negotiations on the country's political and economic crisis ran into the void by venturing on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (for example: the refunding of Venezuela), both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also being conducted in other parts of the country, including the Barinas lowland area, the Mérida and Táchira lowland areas, the Carabobo Bundean State and Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The country's political and economic situation is deteriorating continuously, which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezuelans through an acute lack of food and medication.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the inauguration of the current president Nicolás Maduro, but ultimately the reluctance of a new election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, contributors to Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises the context of the Government decision in her latest article as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">Within the framework of the social, political and economic crisis, where inflation and violence are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% for the end of the year) and in which there is a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine, the referendum on many as the only way to give the country the opportunity to recapture its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or MUD (for example: round table of the Democratic Unity), in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together, urged the demonstrators to join the majority of representatives of the opposition after the 2015 elections.</seg>

<seg id="178">There, the demonstrators moved back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement in front of the police and armed advocates of the government.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later, they could leave the cathedral safely, but the protests continued.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 at Día a Día, an Argentine news site.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to take a look at the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinean city of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano now testified at the great La Perla-Ribera trial in the province of Córdoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial ended on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinian military dictatorship were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden of bearing the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept family secrets.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I thought it was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not realize that my father was a thief, torturer and killer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was a police officer. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was deputy commander of the intelligence department 141 in La Perla prison.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Archive recording.</seg>
<seg id="212">This is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor who is accused of kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quiyanos's son, a man who, over the years, recognized the extent of atrocities he had experienced as a boy and who testified before a Federal Constitutional Court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation.</seg>
<seg id="215">From sports hall to military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">All called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and invited me to identify my friend for it.</seg>

<seg id="347">In the Japanese town of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre where one can prolong his driving licence, last month witnesses of a particularly misused translation.</seg>
<seg id="348">The Japanese word (korean belsha), which means "older motorists," is wrongly translated into a shield, but may also be translated as "terrible motorists."</seg>
<seg id="349">The incorrect translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic advertisement in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Adaptation of the original photographs by Joshua Levine, which was widely shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a citizen of Kyotos, who also made the local newspapers aware of it.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun, which is appearing in Kyoto, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "" "" "how could it come to such an English translation?" ""</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>

<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto Prefecture apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already included in the text they had received by the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported about the apology:</seg>

<seg id="362">In Kyoto, for example, in 2005 1,941 were caused by a total of 19,460 accidents suffered by seniors. this corresponds to a 10% share.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For translating, you need two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and to use active language skills to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English to French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their native language, which could make translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding for translating, tasting or the relatively low number of native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that do not have foreign employees will nevertheless make translations peer-internal. then, the Japanese employee, whose English skills are considered the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confused and enigmatic phrases produced by mechanical translations show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest British phrases in Japan, including the puzzling imprints that often decorate T-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery. however, from large companies or government that have the means to ensure higher standards, more careful translations can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations.</seg>

<seg id="391">The main page of the portal "Navegar con Libertad" (Free Surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the websites of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online broadcasters also recorded footage of protests in Caracas, organized by opposition groups who opposed the government of Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">Protests began at the beginning of April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was coupled and advised the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Censorship: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that web pages of Venezuelan Providers are closed again.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offerings such as Vivoplay are popular with the Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media has been hesitant in the reporting of protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission threatened to punish them with fines and closures as they continue to report on the demonstrations because the Commission saw this as a "appeal to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels, I have signed up again at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">It is amazing that it is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEIO confirmed later that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible by blocking the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online channels.</seg>
<seg id="405">Earlier investigations of the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond incorrectly to requests of certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a webpage is blocked by the DNS, the server responds incorrectly or refuses to request the request when calling such a web site.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third blocked channel, the transmission was suspended on Thursday, 6 April, when the VPITV camera man Elvis Flores, who carried the protests in Caracas live, was arrested.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten, while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on stream again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, the government has also reported that the government regulates Internet connections, making it increasingly difficult for Venezuelans to access multi-media coverage of the current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen" ("Flying cows, falling schools") edited and republished by Global Voices Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before graduating from university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house filled with pride about her. "she's like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "she who has become something," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga never was treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old she started working as a Criadita for the family. as Criadita, Paraguay is known as more than 46.000 boys and girls forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money transfers their underage son or their underage daughter to another, richer family. in exchange, the child receives food, training and a roof over his head.</seg>
<seg id="424">What is not mentioned, however, is that the children must pay for it innumerable days of housework, which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a treaty that one cannot raise.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice called Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of its participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke to Criadita - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Criadazgo - collected witnesses, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name things by name, because the feeling of gratitude that is inoculated by the Criadita is generally not silent.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family, who is their daughter in the belief that they complete their education, improve their position in society and "make something out of themselves," is transferred to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family who assimilates the girl and justifies its exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise not receive education, and perhaps even starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The Victims of Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is mistreated, his family will experience it for many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never experience it.</seg>

<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín was born in Caaguazú, her body showed traces of violent blows. shortly thereafter she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the home of the former military-member Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín was living with them in their house in Vaquería, a small town with only 3.000 inhabitants, 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira attacked Marín as long as she suffered fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later, the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed the fact that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela responsible for the death of the girl deeply rooted in the Paraguayan society.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there was "no further Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely used in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"" "" "" "in Paraguay, more cows are registered as children," "" "said Tina Alvarenga." ""</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers, it is much easier to violate children's rights unpunished.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents, it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbors of the married couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for a quick study of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes to justice, Carolina Marín's case could be trend-setting - for the first time in Paraguay's history, a case of Criadazgo comes before court.</seg>

<seg id="455">The Criaditas are not only exploited as labour force, they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, in which her father worked, had to register bankruptcy and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to work all the time and began to sell candy on the street or on the market to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital Asunción as a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of her employer, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time in such a way that she still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She got up every morning at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">On Fridays, for example, she cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was over, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>

<seg id="466">But even this time was limited because she had to have dinner for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but didn't get unlimited food. "I was able to get more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge," she remembers.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well-equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizers of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party, which during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989, belonged to the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="469">In some evenings the landlord Alvarenga forced to stand next to him and read articles from opposition newspapers such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to convince them not to believe in the reports of the official media about the dictator's regime.</seg>

<seg id="473">Their masters feared that they would lose the education they had made possible for them.</seg>
<seg id="474">She was fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also in school, Alvarenga was discriminated against. "one thing that is almost never talked about is bullying and harassment exposed to Criadita when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anyone home to me. I didn't have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood.</seg>

<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities can impose registration on users. it is also unclear how they should account for those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media enterprises.</seg>

<seg id="525">High up in the mountains of Kurdistan in the north-east of Iraq, the animal rights activist Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the non-governmental organization Nature Iraq aim to protect the ghostly Persian leopards.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subspecies of the leopard family, which strives through Africa and Asia, belongs to the Persian leopards (Panthera Pardus Saxicolor). all in all, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered due to Wilderei, the loss and fragmentation of their habitat and since they find less and less loot.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular leopard important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"" "as Raza shows in the video," "" "The Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" "" "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem depends also on the fact that a big predator is present." ""</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard in the wild is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a record of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a biologist, Raza passionately shows a different side of her country, which consists not only of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies on wildlife and educational programs from Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School on Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>

<seg id="544">At the beginning of March 2017, Kahoku Shimpo, the North-Northeast of Japan, documented the progress made over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "Triple Catastrophe" in March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atomic accident in Fukushima had triggered the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi prefecture. Miyagi prefecture was a number of prefectures in Japan's Northeast, which experienced both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring villages Fukushima and Iwate were forced to flee, because the tsunami had lost entire coastal cities off the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">The Fukushima prefecture once again experienced a nuclear accident, so alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The Kahoku Shimpo's special report shows from a local point of view what progress has been made six years later to rebuild the lives of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both the statistics of the Japanese Imperial Administration and the survey results of the affected persons themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The residential construction site in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses (to be used, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was able to record the greatest success among the three prefectures, where 80 per cent of the planned replacement houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate completed 75 percent of such houses, while Fukushima debuts the closing light at 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">However, even six years after the catastrophe, the evacuation of temporary shelters (to be used to resettle casetsu juutaku) into final spare-homes.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple disaster almost 80,000 people were forced to live in temporary shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 still 36,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate still lived in such dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of those evacuated from Fukushima in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, while Miyagi was more successful here. more than 75 percent of the evacuated evacuated homes were resettled into final homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the figure is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools who were affected by misfortune have opened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 per cent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing harbours have resumed their operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident have affected agricultural land extensively in the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, accounting for only 66 percent of agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 per cent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farmland by Fukushima are located in the "nuclear blackout zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures the tourism has recovered largely, but also here Fukushima remains far abused.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent at the same level as before disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can show only 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal dwellers found it more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to establish an overall picture, the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuees. it questioned them about the state of reconstruction and also how their empathy towards the tsunami-risk has changed.</seg>
<seg id="571">In its introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami consciousness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey showed that 83.1 percent of local residents took measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents find that still not enough was done in disaster prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it is about those who had to be evacuated from the Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its edition of the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacuees from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to experience not only the tremendous earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was also witness to the worst disaster-induced nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuees from Fukushima, nearly 63,000 people were relocated to areas outside of the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 more than 23,000 people were resettled back to Fukushima, in permanent replacement homes.</seg>
<seg id="580">According to the 2017 booth, there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">Most of the evacuated victims in the disaster areas are older than 50 years old. it is well known that the efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people come across people from other countries who speak a different language, the differences seem to be greater than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often recognizes that one more links than it seems at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look at these global connections. in our Into the Deep Podcast we treat issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We talk to five Global Voices members who remember a moment in which they felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni talks about the similarities between Greek and Turkish; Tori Egherman explains how the love of music overwhelmed the lack of common language skills during a trip in rural China; Adriana Macias talks about the time she worked with people from all over the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="594">Right: Mateus Ferreira da Silva in a widely used photo.</seg>
<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was admitted to the intensive care unit this week: last Friday, a police officer had struck him in a strike against the head during a demonstration in Goiânia. nationwide, millions of demonstrators took part in a protest march against austerity measures.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studied social sciences at the Federal University of Goiás, has suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated on this Saturday and now put him in an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local image journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a strike. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police announced in the Brazilian state of Goiás that Sampaio was suspended until the investigation of the incident was suspended by the active service.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officers, how he strikes in Goiana with his stick on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer was beaten up by a demonstrator and landed on the intensive care unit, his face would be on TV for six months and the entire repression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desnealizador," a news channel from media activists from Goiânia, shared the video taken by Luiz da Luz, in which one sees how Mateus is attacked by the police officer and several paramedics are rushing to him.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, filmed from another perspective, is also immersed in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mateus from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus living in another state, Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian Reais (approximately 2,700 euros) to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Goiana while he is in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="608">"be brave, Mateus.</seg>

<seg id="610">The drawing was shared several times in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="611">By: Heir Vilela. publication with permission.</seg>
<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado calls for more violent attacks against activists in Goiás:</seg>
<seg id="613">Goiás is experiencing a wave of political violence: here, the activist Guilherme Irish was assassinated by his father, because he was accused of criminalizing the Occupy movement in secondary schools. and now we have the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who is in the intensive care unit after being attacked by a policeman who struck him with a stick.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police Transactions</seg>
<seg id="615">Goiás was not the only state in Brazil in which there was brutal police action against protesters last Friday.</seg>
<seg id="616">Police officers were at protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had set up a stage for orators, rubber floors and tear gas.</seg>
<seg id="617">The MEP Flavio Serafini, Socialist and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to renounce violent demonstrations against demonstrators via loudspeakers.</seg>
<seg id="618">This includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers in the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media have slipped street protests by focusing on another unexpected protagonist: a window pane.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and Estado de S.Paolo purposely reported on a broken glass window to illustrate their front pages illustrative.</seg>
<seg id="621">On the other hand, O Globo preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special thing.</seg>
<seg id="623">This must also be recognised if you are strictly opposed to any kind of damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here again, the term "vandalism" gets an absurd, disproportionate meaning, and the typical violence of the military police is covered by headlines with the title "protesters on confrontation course with the police."</seg>
<seg id="625">The villages forgotten by the industralization in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane mills in the whole of Cuba closed doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The popular village Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - despite the fact that there is no appreciable sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities in sugar cane mills were paralysed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After exhaustion, the sugar cane industry in the region stood still, and the factory gradually lost its installations until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resign and commute daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran, who rises every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane mills in the east of the region, which after a long inactive time were back in operation because they were received.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers that Mañalich would receive the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry had already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, the low market prices, inefficiency, poor management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for concern for the country several decades ago, but the bad harvests are no longer a novelty.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the church already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane mills were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they became unbearable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">Between 2017 and 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 published report "Regional economic perspectives" by the OECD and FAO, the Agriculture and Food Organisation of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate around 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will certainly go into history," "" "these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, a total of 98 sugar cane mills, more than 65 million people received their full salary for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez has worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">"" "when Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, the word he repeated most is" "" "deception" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents were of the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first leap year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">These were officially recorded documents, which were distinguished only with regard to the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on the responsibility was passed and the letters were becoming more and more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the discontinued factory for two years, and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane mills still in use," he assures.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, waits for retirement in another facility, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was in charge of his will to shut down the factory in whose construction he helped.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part he removed, he disassembled one of his 31 years of working.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial area of Cuba and most important worktops has been extinguished.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, there were no alternatives for the jobs and services generated by the facilities in the municipalities where they were located.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know whether during the Mammoth speech of 21 October 2002, the then President looked into the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years, everything would go well.</seg>
<seg id="671">The price of the population for closure of sugar cane mills</seg>
<seg id="672">Since 2004, sugar cane has been extracted only high by milling.</seg>
<seg id="673">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="674">After two years, the village Gregorio Arleé Mañalich learned that many things change, but not always for the better when a factory is closed.</seg>
<seg id="675">When the sugar cane factory closed, or better said than they began to deter them, they also stopped asphalting the road, this disadvantaged other farms.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with an advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to look for other factories.</seg>
<seg id="677">They were replaced with spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="678">Without the prospect of the future many young people left the region.</seg>
<seg id="679">A food factory has been created in the area, and its production does not even serve to supply the community.</seg>
<seg id="680">The ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive.</seg>
<seg id="681">At the end of 2016, Nene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Coloma, the ruins of the place where he began working.</seg>
<seg id="682">Ninety-nine harvests bring to the old soldier a retirement of two thousand peso per month to spend the years in retirement in Mañalich.</seg>
<seg id="683">Mr. Nene, a man of black skin color, small, with few teeth and a clear voice, is no supporting person, yet he does not forgive the lies that you told him.</seg>
<seg id="684">They have been torturing him for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="685">Nene goes back 65 years in retirement, not because it lacks power, but because he is bitterly.</seg>

<seg id="689">First Nations young people use hip-hop to express themselves and get their own culture</seg>
<seg id="690">Welcome to a song by "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>
<seg id="691">Photo used with permission of N'we Jinan.</seg>
<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations communities across Canada deal with themes that are important to them. they do it through Hip-Hop, thanks to a number of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan Tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile audio studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the pedagogue David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked with ten Cree-Communities in North-Quebec and then collaborated with the Cree hip-hop group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop thus increases that the young participants discuss topics such as "cultural identity, language, conflict, love, self acceptance," or whatever comes to mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are an inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the territory of the tribe of the Kitsummonum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a street section in West kanada, where nearly two dozens of mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">Most of the cases were not clarified.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to mediate the importance of preserving traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people did not always speak the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapsooostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the refrain is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved here received some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars hip-hop band, who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available in transcript, as is a translation into English translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody ever is interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will hear our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">This is how they can grow and move forward as well as our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they intended for the Creator</seg>
<seg id="713">In the comments section the reader and advocate of Cree-language Kevin Brousseau also makes a contribution and adds the verse to syllabus (which is also published on his blog and is reissued here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what exactly is on the menu, are shown close to the entrance shokuhin gentpuru (see the "plastic models of dishes") of every dish served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers will see these plastic dishes and then decide whether they will enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the tokioter district of Kappabashi, there are a large number of small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they do not even notice them. a new trend, however, is now transformed into showy mobile accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin gentpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in the special sale: new plastic strips, decorated with plastic ribbons, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial food were turned into kitschy collecting properties, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin cooling magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in eating habits is becoming more and more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, an imperial-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was transformed into a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also produced this part for the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple holding your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone stands and mobile designers allow you to make your own work of art. in this case, ikura or salmon roe is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there anybody who would say:" wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon cheating? "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appetizing form in order to surprise e.g. colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile stand has the shape of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and wristbands of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Further whimsical plastic dishes you can watch at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag #.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, then this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports from domestic and foreign media on the notorious "fight against drug trade" in Mexico, the missing and gearing regularly appear only in statistics. these, however, do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle brings.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reports of drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the head of the Sinaloa cartel, pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the bereaved or the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind every body, behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds might never heal.</seg>
<seg id="753">For this reason, the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime not only causes us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when shops close because they are threatened by traffickers and whole communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "a video entitled" "" "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" "" "(German:" "" "how fear lives change" "" ") tells exactly these stories." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches for secret graves after his son every weekend.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews on just one day.</seg>
<seg id="762">"" "priests:" "" "like every Sunday we prepare ourselves today for the task which we have set ourselves to go and search for tombs, according to the people we have loved." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="772">"" "where should we get them?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"" "" "" "we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and state leadership." ""</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known illness and sensationalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come across newspaper kiosks every day and see the front pages with images that can only come from a textbook for criminology or from files of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10-year-old cousin is thinking that he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealer) when he is big. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic" of the offenders when they walk through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the inaction of people is incredible for me, if the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village could be justified by the fact that they were" "" "soaked" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to argue that they are spared from such tragedies if they do not touch and remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four months blackmail in the Capital City district: how a family was looted with threats." it describes how armed criminals were squeezing money from their business month by month, until they destroyed not only the business, but also tore their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think about everything that you have lost and how many people can completely change your entire life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never passes, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will kidnap you or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">In these horrible days I asked if weeping would dissolve my deeply rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega has published the article "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation of violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing wife and a man murdered by organized crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">What is it like to grow up in a settlement on the edge of Mexico's most dangerous city?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and he tells him to teach himself how to cook an egg, keep potatoes, keep tortillas warm and make "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years before, when he was only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody corpse of his father who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, as a force through organized crime and the struggle against the existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of murders according to the Citizens Council for Public Safety and Government of the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the prosecutor's office had 3103 killings. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 hours per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of stories behind organized crime in Mexico and which invade the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories still live in the face of new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal Político 2015 launched the journalism project Narcodata, whose aim is to portray the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trade, which has tormented the country in the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="817">"sharing is Caring" by Flickr user Niklas Wikström (CC-BY-NC 2.0) WARNMENT: this article and the pages to which he links contains pictures on which violence is represented.</seg>
<seg id="818">The fact check is important in a moment when it comes to lifting a rumor or to unmask a falsification.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the years after something has appeared for the first time? content in social media, whether true or false, tends to persist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication, it has been misleading to illustrate tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false link between picture and event - "false description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful coverage of events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">It raises questions about our desire for images to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker crossed the town Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted and exploded. 230 people lost their lives.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second-largest country had been neglected for years and thus devastated. the roads in the region became dangerous pathways full of potholes, which were difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank car fell victim to it.</seg>
<seg id="828">Public authorities described a fireball that enveloped dozens of houses, including a cinema nearby which was full of people watching the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses scattered and charred corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to the unknown.</seg>
<seg id="831">"" "a picture with the title" "" "That is Nigeria." "" "by Imgur User Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day." ""</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charred bodies that are strung on the ground while people watch them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not come to an end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years the same photo was copied several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and falsely attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses drastically reported atrocities they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one left to count corpses," "" "said a resident of Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images, the follow-up time could be depicted visually.</seg>
<seg id="844">The attack was also unsolved, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo emerged again, as it was wrongly presented as evidence of the fact and potential extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of false attributions; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the picture was presented as a proof of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further, personal comments, such as this example falsely link the image from the DR Congo to sources of mass media in order to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecutions of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a lightning announcement, published by the United Nations described those who could flee could strike, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported on the violence against the Rohingya, Posts appeared like the following who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page, which was falsely claimed by Myanmar's Thein Sein, monks and politicians had participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate this information.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and Images</seg>
<seg id="928">Here are two strong topics or frames (framing) that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the murders of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assassinations of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Understanding religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">"" "" "" "with social media there are tens of people who unintentionally share the water around a tragedy." ""</seg>
<seg id="934">Does this mood of false and false information suggest that actual atrocities are untrue and diminish the actual horrors of what actually happened in DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The distribution of violent pictures has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that rejecting images of a refusal to recognise the tragedy is to recognise the tragedy. sometimes these images are even required by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images sensitize readers and viewers to empathy and empower them to empathy (such as this study that investigated how violent media work to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss about violent portrayals in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists try to experiment with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which an image suggests something, which can actually be derived from context or completely abusive.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, any investigation of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e.g. invaluable) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or impossible to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">There are such words in every language: they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these invaluable words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese Saudi) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture (such as the Spanish sobrewing).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or phrase is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context are needed to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected in an online list for a whole period of time.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">For example, in the blog you can find words from Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - take care of your parents in recognition of your efforts in your recent years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunselling language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The comfort or laziness that one feels after being warmed in the sun on cold days.</seg>

<seg id="1135">Stories told by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language storytelling (TLS) initiative, the enumeration of stories in their original language is a possible answer to this.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the irreplaceable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the linguistic diversity of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already carried out events since 2015, there is a risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project the following applies:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that assume diversity - safe spaces where residents don't have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening frequently is often associated with understanding" "" "these events" "" "instead" "" "listen to appreciate, feel, touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers present their story in their own language and then translate or interpret them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their devotion and their presentation lead to the fact that the audience is insisting on it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional history from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamara tells the fabel from the rabbit and baboon in the language of Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"" "after explaining the importance of his fable, John Nyamara asks:" "" "how is it to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" "" "with a wide grin, he shares his feeling of inclusiveness:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1150">You listened to it!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were alert...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers are hoping to expand this. anyone who is inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytelling tours.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounts to 72 million US dollars, several religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration on April 3, 2017. the march commenced with Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went up to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juans.</seg>

<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture that is held in Berlin, an event dedicated to the # FreeBassel campaign was dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the French-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, managing director of Book Sprints, a publishing house published by so-called 'book Sprints', read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a Collective Research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book published last year and published here is a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It's a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it means:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built and what are the real costs associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense of our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to release Bassel Khartoum, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was removed from the list of the Adra prison in which he sat on October 3, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">We have since then no information about his current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective Remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing that Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has let many of us start thinking about their own destinies, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we decide for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of temporary extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">Since March 2012, the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody by Syrian government authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military establishment, to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer, Noura Ghazi, reported that the "military police" Bassel had taken part in a "strictly secret" command of the military court from his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by individuals who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His place of residence and condition remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassels's cultural prototypes was more proactive than the work he began with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually recreate the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilisations and here Greek-Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time, Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he began this work, the IS would put everything on it, this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not finish this project until now.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life of dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English even when he was already in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with anyone who has asked. he has taught other detainees to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of waiting (waiting), a commission which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together on the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English.</seg>

<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted with anger to an abrupt fall in which a government member returned after half his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus where corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years imprisonment along with four other defendants because of the impurity of 54 million metics (about 800 000 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public money from Mozambique airports, the Council of which Cambaza ruled between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for good lead and immediately called for his resetting to the company, which happened on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which evaluated the motion, there would be no reason for Cambaza to relinquish his old post as the company did not carry out disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not welcome the action.</seg>
<seg id="1261">In an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned the decision of the company to resume its director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and exemplifies the lack of transparency and is even a step backward with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that also the firm should have introduced a disciplinary action against the contrary.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East India or generally used as adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook uses the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or" "" "calves" "" "(in Burmese script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of the hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely degrading connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts where they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubt for their use have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with different meanings that have the same letter sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, the chair is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (splitting bse), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kaleiaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooknäutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty way, if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question word (la) in Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet is of the opinion that it will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be analytical before it extinguishes all posts that are suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you write on Factook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the words opposite.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae."</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty Nationalists, who spread hate speech, receive a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise her nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to everyone who disseminates hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat showed that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby social networks simply start using a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new policy of Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was banned from posting, posting and sharing content for 24 hours, because the post "did not meet the Facebook Community standards."</seg>

<seg id="1322">Facebook likes to have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it doesn't work like that.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "in addition, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden words like" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "pea curry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsified posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook automatic censorship caused a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>

<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this uncomplicated cause, and at some point, doubts arose whether the opposition would agree on the bill in general.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the bill against child marriage was resolved - despite four senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent one who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him the law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the President of the country has to agree and proclaim the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators gave a status update on Facebook, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against child marriage was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and none of them decided against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After it was decided in the Senate before, the draft can now become a law.</seg>

<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General of Paris Al rawi, an advocate of the law, said it was quite legitimate when Maharaj wanted to act against the law, most social media users wanted to address the debate on the subject differently.</seg>

<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But whether it comes to a legal action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where the child marriage in different gradations is legal or still the norm, although there are laws that underline it.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia page in English was presented on 18 January 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA, internationally obscured.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month Turkey has now blocked the popular and popular Encyclopedia Wikipedia principle based on the crowdsourcing principle.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day, it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series resist the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech savvy Internet users are used to using bypass tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has since 2008 locked articles from Wikipedia, as described recently in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockings of the Internet have been taking place since 2007, after the Internet Law (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China, Turkey is the second most known country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, there are now several mirror sites (pages which mirror the contents of Wikipedia and often updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">One solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System) when the platform put all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its distributed peer-to-peer network (i.e. calculator-machine connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">However, the content is accessible despite legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS talks about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we've heard the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we set everything to put Snapshots from Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. thus, there is the possibility to read the contents in a decentralized and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a mirror site from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors sites if locked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member and staff at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access another URL that is not the original. that which you see then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server further guides the request to the correct Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1414">A rasping rhinoceros, Chitwan.</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">With permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurry with poorly positioned motifs and balanced colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera himself and to try to bury the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepal's wildlife to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown next to the Chitwan National Park, gives him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Neptune's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class location helps him with his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live on the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti River a leopard would be.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river embankment is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was located and I immediately began to kindle pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Neptune nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, for he was already face to face to Tigers:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep when sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Bedtime for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was at home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the boy appeared. he sat down immediately, we see us and he stares me through the scarf-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">"" "to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo" "" "I click for conservation" "" "(lit.: I click for environmental protection) on its photos." ""</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Neptune nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, mostly living in a tent to make pictures of Ottern at Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This post was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international media organisation from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, it is possible to avoid women with the greatest care to pronounce the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "instead, they use a pronouns or say" "" "father of my child." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that due to social pressure they should respect the husband, as well as fear of the consequences they should respect the norm, keep this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted by the Indian State of Odisha by a criminal court and violated by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married relative with her name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of naming their wives also not by name is common among men. however, they have much less fear to fear if at all which ones, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel and housewives, joined a unique club and became the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the community of Video Volunteers and advocates for the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to expose practices such as children's marriage and the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected individuals, and lead those clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports on how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her discussion group dealt with women who did not call her husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to pronounce the name of their husbands as loud is a custom that they all held accountable and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is regarded as a deceitful woman, as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try out at home as it is going.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round of her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned around and said I should call him from now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini started the first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to initiate the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to express the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked all, "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want it means that they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought their husbands on their lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on breaking a centuries-old tradition in which married women are never allowed to speak the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she walked just before her during the whole exercise; another decided to release the entire frustration against him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the adrenalin rush of having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try to name their husbands at home.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the coming days, Rohini received a large number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put into the head of women: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she got scared and said it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said:" "" "Rohini meant I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation started violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the zinced red dot on the forehead that shows the marriage status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would wear the zinced red dot when he did it.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely stopped, but think they are in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the Discussion Club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make a trip with every discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear something," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years now and yet I have never been so honestly speaking about some things, for example, how our identities are linked to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say things out loud, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only worn saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most, this is okay, but some wanted to wear a Saline-kurta, a wide shirt over a trousers; they did not dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much controversy and discussion about the advantages of the own dress code, the morals linked to the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled their own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion group so that the women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to go on a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will manage it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether something changed in the five months since their first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things are coming slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have only made small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped saying the name of their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including myself, do it, but only if they are alone and there are no other family members.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberred on their foreheads at all times.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like haggling for more freedom of movement or the choice of clothes - lie at the end of a heavily navigating river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini declares:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each one of us the confidence that something is going to change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1547">The Beatles during their landing in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1548">Screenshot of the official YouTube channel of the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1549">On June 29th this year the hashtag was to be held in the Japanese Twitter trend, where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The visit of the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a reversal in the Japanese culture of the postwar period.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who interviewed the Beatles in London in 1964, noticed in 2016 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the first visit:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just about five days the Beatles were in the country, but this has been enough to let the Japanese go through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The people here became quite quickly clear that they had no other choice than to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many well-known Japanese sizes had reached their zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The music of the cult band is "more than just a universal language like English," said Ryuichi Isaka, president of the individual trade giant Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Good morning! today is the Beatles memorial day in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Also today songs from the Beatles are sung in Japanese karaoke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools.</seg>
<seg id="1558">The kitsch of the Beatles survives everything.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Today is Beatles memorial day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">We all love the Beatles in our house.</seg>
<seg id="1561">I don't know if this "Winnie the Pooh" doll is supposed to represent John Lennon or not.</seg>
<seg id="1562">And as it is for fans, Japanese naturally also make pilgrimages to the well-known places associated with the band.</seg>
<seg id="1563">If you love the Beatles, these are your 5 places that you absolutely have to visit.</seg>
<seg id="1564">1) Abbey Road</seg>
<seg id="1565">2) Matthew Street (Liverpool)</seg>
<seg id="1566">3) Strawberry Fields (Memorial in New York)</seg>
<seg id="1567">4) Penny Lane</seg>
<seg id="1568">5) (From the Link) The Beatles Story (Museum), Liverpool</seg>
<seg id="1569">The pilgrimages can sometimes not be quirky enough:</seg>
<seg id="1570">Good morning together.</seg>
<seg id="1571">Today is Beatles memorial day.</seg>
<seg id="1572">In 1966, the Beatles came to Japan for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">The characters from the film K-On were on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road.</seg>
<seg id="1574">The same thing we did last year too.</seg>
<seg id="1575">And of course, some companies also use the fan base for marketing purposes, such as this Ramen shop (Ramen are Japanese noodles) in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Good morning, here is Mutahiro Koya Ramen! "today is Beatles memorial day.</seg>
<seg id="1577">And what could this be for a day?</seg>
<seg id="1578">Today I will listen to "Yesterday" and eat Ramen noodles at Mutaro Koya.</seg>
<seg id="1579">That is how the day will go today.</seg>
<seg id="1580">So, we hope you are there!</seg>
<seg id="1581">This is followed by the hashtag, to see the Beatles commemorative day.</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping of bald persons for organ trafficking, presumably for disbelievers, is disturbing the police of Zambézia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometers from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was beheaded and a part of the organs had been removed.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and the result was that the organs of shamans were used in Tanzania and Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There is the local superstition that the head of a man-headed man could uncover gold or bring wealth, the police spokesman of Zambézia announced the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>

<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he had been hospitalized due to liver cancer in the terminal stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (state risk), having participated in the draft Charter 08, a manifesto that demanded democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Lius case as" "" "an internal affair" "" "and told a spokesman, he considered it" "" "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China continues to release calls from the international community, Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or to allow him a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">A spokesman, however, refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exert pressure to allow Liu to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway, Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende have refused to answer questions about licensing.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came to a standstill after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that it ultimately has nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume exports to China, since exports have been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union - European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to release Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and to allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called on China for the release of Lius, as announced in a statement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Lius's wife and family members.</seg>

<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman of the US embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced on June 27 that the embassy requested the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu, but also to free his wife Liu Xia from her house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The U.S. Embassy prompts a furious response from China, with the utterance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that "no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley announced that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom, such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice, to which they are entitled according to the Chinese constitution and legal system and international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The U.S. senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum called on China to provide Liu with appropriate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu's lawyer told AFP that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to speak and contact someone outside, including his lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum tells us:</seg>

<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama and the Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual guide in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned with Liu in an explanation on June 28, stating that many asked him to pray for Liu's well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and was severely punished for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn had contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and concerned citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, who signed charter 08 that stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem silly, since Singapore is internationally recognised as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York, the Minister noticed that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported Singapore to be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people commit a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog" "" "Cavalierio" "" "accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "twist the logic" "" "in order to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land, it is said that we are ultimately not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar that it had the appearance of a flight in front of the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very posh: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of that, he appeared invariably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In contrast, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities which are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core of the topic, the good old lyre emerges from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic because it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, the last week of Shanmugam gave answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system, really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He disguised such questions with non-answers of rational nature.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country but a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clarify this point, provided that it was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his commentary on the blog, he points out the reviews that one should start reading the entire transcript of the conference, so that the context of the statements made by Shanmugam could be better understood, according to which Singapore was a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said Singapore was rather a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the elections in Singapore were so unequal, even if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party win for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said Singapore" "" "is no country," "" "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who is the leader of a growing generation, who makes such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - do I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the Singapore political leaders, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes this is really associated and aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review discovers the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "did Mr. Shanmugam" "" "faithfully commit a mistake" "" "or was it a Freudian speaker?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only viewed as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, which country will the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the cabinet's cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of grave importance.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way to migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 592-year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral pink brillon frame and gold coloured earrings in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Afrika.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2.50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel, but there are hundreds of African and Haitian immigrants arriving here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, says Mrs. Ramírez, people come to full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year, Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept on boxes outside.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, she buys them medication they can't pay, they massage them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The family Sebastiao (with her daughter Mercalli, who has a Joghurtbeard) posses with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>

<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and move northwards.</seg>
<seg id="1925">"" "the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." "" "Mama Afrika is a well-known name on the route," "" "says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">He says that the Haitians and the Africans often travel together and that Africans already talk to Whatsapp from Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weakened, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Afrika is our mother and we will never leave her again," "" "he answers smiling." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez tells her guests often send text messages when they have gone to greet them or to report to her about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">MS Ramírez is perhaps very well-known here, but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city, a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have recorded migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He started to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a hob outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I lived in the United States," "" "he said." "" "I have experienced what they are experiencing." ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">"" "there are places where people help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1946">After he lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants travelling through Tapachula are from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to blackmail him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, a single educator, offered him her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and tries to decide where to go the next step.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the House of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the corridors, the travellers should consult their phones quietly.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic, because of those who have departed.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she flips in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair care she has made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly, while she introduces her to me.</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjiang by twitter user.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The residents of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan District of Urumqi received a phone notification in which they instruct the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the message, it is said that the app" "" "preventing access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the Autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because they had shared messages with a private WeChat group shortly after they had installed the app.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the communication of the police, the app would identify and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is blocking pornographic web pages, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with minors filtering is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"" "for example, the" "" "remote control" "" "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person." ""</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While notifications about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and discontent in the areas of conflict, the authorities often submit extreme censoring and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The media outlet "Images from mainland China" published on Twitter, published censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where police officers checked the residents randomly whether they had installed the Surveillance App.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile alert demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, it could be detained up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They forced the people to use devices intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the recovery technology.</seg>

<seg id="1984">"" "" "" "images from mainland China" "", "a Jingwang product description, which indicates that the software can lift the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive." ""</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang, computers and cell phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Party Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All branches of government, government and related institutions, including universities and research institutes, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office on the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report by Freedom House, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, authorities issued a regulation on June 27 in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs, until 1 August to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards" at local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos." however, this action violates the personal rights of Urumquis's three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a number of other possible offences, including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emballam Hdaib smoked a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he travels to his canvas, sometimes to his computer, sometimes even to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine-spotted lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the upper floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaibs family to flee from their village in Palestine, in which they had lived as felahyees (for example: farmers).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their well-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapture.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics such as orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues are not only relevant in his hometown of Amman relevance, but also in cities ranging from Damascus in Syria to Yemen in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">At the age of 25, Hdaib considers himself to be someone who is not limited by boundaries in his mind, and he can feel at home with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not admit it openly, he hates a special aversion to the US foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones has anything to do with his identity as the "Palestinian refugees of the second generation" - so he calls himself, even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine yet.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think so," says Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so, because I am a man," "" "while he poured into water Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam on a hot summer day.</seg>
<seg id="2107">In principle, the lustre of lukewarm coffee and the squadron of the Kent-cigarette in the nose mainly speak of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially if you throws a look into neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">It is therefore easy to do basic things - just as drinking water in public during Ramadan - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently the interior ministry of Jordan has cancelled the band Mashrou'Leila for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front citizen Hamed Sinno contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert evening.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the MP and former press spokesperson of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahrib said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "" "just" "" "had been cancelled because of the singer's sexual orientation." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, Human Rights and Freedom of Expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which places the tried-and-tested legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila rated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporter of human rights," who continue to choose "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement should probably not be simply a shallow rhetoric, but in fact reflected an ever more clearly crystallizing reality in Jordan, which appears clearly in Hdaib's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib returned traditional sex men to Leibe by forming his vision of the fate of Arab women who have marital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an apparently depressed unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should really trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">"" "in recent years, the number of" "" "volunteers" "" "has been accepted in Jordan - the inofficial outside." ""</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of volunteers reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still notorious that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on crime control dating back to 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can "be held in prison indefinitely," and for their release is often necessitated by years of bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee on the part of the family that nothing will happen to the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaib's music enjoys great popularity and is well-known for not shy away from issues that have long been considered taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">I was informed of politics, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song named "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib attacks the question of Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song called "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated conspicuously:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where you, in his words, "get what you want" - be it faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals were censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online programme, Roya, to remember that his comments were torn from context, twisted and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, streamed, but only one edited version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib is campaigning for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance towards homosexuals does not speak to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib is asking: if Abu Nudie, who would later work on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemite kingdom it is nothing new that the government attacks attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service held several former government officials and members of the teacher's association, arguing that they had critical comments on social media issues related to the corruption that has been deeply rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaib's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to create a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has now denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - so it sees Hdaib - consists of slow, thought-out and internal changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without any interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of" "" "experiencing it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness by means of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and democracies brought about by it. at least he hopes this.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is so far, Hdaib will continue to rap and consequently resist.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting which Aman was a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warrior dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One suspects that it is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the festive carriages, the drums and dancing have been handed over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies from the west of Japan marched into the Northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the emissi, to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We could grab a few great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A joint venture in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the Meguro Gajo for a long time: two solid cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend its summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The sight of a 18 metre high solid car was incredible.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let's enjoy the rest of the summer!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Outside appearances and personal care were rare as in this story, as they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like the barber.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate, where road robbery and illegal drug trafficking are commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 revealed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) has led to the fact that more and more average citizens are entering the skilled hands of hairdressers that can recreate these complex hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There experts compete against each other to show who of them can create the most eccentric looks, as you can see in the following video (more videos on current contests are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school of Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found an opportunity to convince young people to trade their weapons against hairdressing tools and to get a training in the hairdressing art instead of bad advice that allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered, dozens of youths have seen that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Before the school year beginning in March, the school offered special education workshops and reported on some of its successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only professional school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud, because from love to the children we have built this educational community.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the contribution "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel alienated?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Exactly this question left the Young-Youth Foundation Leonardo Párraga from the Foundation Bogotá and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired them to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part to this: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces), which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signing of the peace agreement was considered so important that the Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services.</seg>
<seg id="2188">Before the Colombians, however, there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters, who have lived in illegal camps for many years, had been exposed to war rhetoric and were carrying their weapons around the clock, must now re-integrate into the lives of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, which had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now record them in their ranks and support them in building up a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians had to join together and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: so far, thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back into society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter - to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for reconciliation was born at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more urgently.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people this year, which needed the most pressing interest.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus the plan emerged to write letters full of hope and support to former FARC fighters, who now have to find their place in society and build a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN campsites in the region of Caldono-Cauca on March 19.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students of the university Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation traveled to the camp to personally transfer the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">Members of the FARC set themselves up as they had done before to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," told the political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go in because next to him on the bed was a GL-Garnet, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I said," "" "Hello, what are they doing right now?" "" "he said," "" "I answer a letter that someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "" "" "never in my life has someone written something so beautiful, so I answer it." "" "suddenly tears ran over my cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him and sat down beside the pomegranchers.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of the war, was tired of being the faithful companion of this warrior all the years, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from starvation. "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New Voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the beginning students and some leaders of the FARC came together to a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC was already in hiding.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state took effect on the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop a political party, we can help shape society in this country more just.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "the aim of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles," "" "one of them said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear these people who have never found hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I have often seen as a monster and even hate, are only people with beautiful feelings that have been turned around by their life circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who have been killed and caused so much harm, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former warriors responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of the city of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">Columbianism was prophesied that peace would reign after disarming.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities exist, there will always be people who are ready to access the weapons, raise themselves and protest for their rights. and that is also completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC are now putting on peace, a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and offer sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the foundation of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2252">When it was grown, you became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for them, which is why they moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of Chechens had learned about the gender balance of their landlady, the hunt for Sabrina was opened.</seg>
<seg id="2254">Out of fear for her life, she ultimately moved to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend from Dagestan, a woman who was in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took her without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere on the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent them to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there are no more men in Chechnya that can remove that shame?"</seg>

<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for being respectful of me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked me to return to Chechnya to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They set absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by running through the streets without going through the streets; others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Grozny and say that I had not changed my sex, that everything was just bad speech, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have body size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once said my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world that has damaged not only your family but the entire republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she laid a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later under the window stood a car with dark window panes and a license plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it had happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was something rotten.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activists checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you escape?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to disclose their names but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something unbelievable happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought them without registering, without knowing anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"" "at the moment when I wanted to call my mom via WhatsApp, I got a message:" "" "you don't believe, you are in security just because you have left the country?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you are stuck. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "only to prove it to you: it is the number 115." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about gender equality, that's a taboo topic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I really struggle to look at the person she recalls from her past - that is, my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know anything about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who spent one and a half months in his gun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He said that during Ramadan people were not arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">With this I mean, they most likely invite the relatives, these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end require proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: will even now gay men be held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there wouldn't be so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to meet Kadyrow's court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that they can later present them as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say," "" "If they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but specifically submerged to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this only a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, that person was himself when these people were taken along.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, there have not been any reports yet. however, we assume that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and abductions of people who belong to so-called "non-traditional" orientations have already occurred in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known in Grozny, when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">Seriously!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was applied, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia wanted to introduce us to" "" "civilisation" "", "but finally pushed us back to the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had tinted eyelashes, wore skirts jeans and short loops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Safety of Sharia has never even curbed me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian Theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially at weekends, a whole group of people met like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"" "in the Chechen language there is a saying: Khardama Kharda. that is," "" "Don't laugh at the misfortune of another." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children if they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never offended me, never hunted and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrov appeared on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not speak about us per se, but mainly about the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - one could sense how the people in the city began to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who laughed and laughed at first looked at you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the Republic steadily deteriorated.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what are your activities now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teetreffs, gatherings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a cent for it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I clicked on refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you carry a Hiddenab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that is silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is, it has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens who want you to prophesy with foam in front of your mouth that there are no gays with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestan have the ones who have cabardines, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet there are them - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I'm from there, so it's unpleasant to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">Here I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think about transience to men who love men, and they believe that one is changing their sex to make more intimate experiences. but that is a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be exact, different life attitudes.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry that I will be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2396">The Iranian wine region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the local Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last few months there has been a strong rise in suicide.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Yassim Moramazi on 27 August gave the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, characterized by poverty and unemployment, into the limelight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the Southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to arise for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who wish to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he lit himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani Hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have hung up.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers who felt helpless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahrazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, where a large part of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran, has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the local Arab population to make a living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and in 1925 it undertook great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable agricultural areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population receives little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often the victim of untreated illnesses, hunger and privations.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime is systematically rebelling against the Ahrazi-Arabs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a large number of dams, the water from the Arab areas to the Persian areas, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are diverted.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only managed to aggravate the devastation caused by dryness, and destroy local agriculture as well as fish and palm industries.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab ahawks now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Director General for Cooperation, Labour and Social Welfare reported that 5% of Ahrazis who are looking for a job, completed primary school, completed 55% of secondary school and have a 45% university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"" "a" "" "systematic strategy... aimed at destroying the mind of national resistance" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian human rights activist based in London, said Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" in the number of suicide among young Ahrazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since officials and institutions prefer not to recruit Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to annihilate the spirit of national resistance among young Arabs and to force them to earn their living outside their home.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi and thus be employed, since even Arab names at the workplace are not tolerated, let alone the speaking of the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances that Arab Ahwazi has to endure, human rights activists beat alert before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>
<seg id="2430">Depression is treatable and suicide is avoidable.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion published by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the website of Afroféminas. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women react - especially white women who call themselves intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put out well thought out scientific and societal arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should be all feminists * in general.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, despite the same education, women still earn less money than men nowadays.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms always ensure that women come to a glass ceiling in various areas of life sooner or later, and that discrimination based on sex is still going through the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and well-known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced that I will be twice and triple among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, when I come to skin color, on racism, on black Cis women, on black transient women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the diaspora; if I mention how we have always been abused physically, mentally and verbally, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But all agree that women - all women - should come together to "raise their voices and to sing" Kumbaya, my Lord, "in order to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualised violence, there is an institutionalised form of racist violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin deserve less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men, and all men at all to have the same rights; on the other hand, as a black woman, I can not join a movement in which the white woman stands, who refuses to take into account injustices in her mind, which refer to the sex as well as to the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">"" "" "" "I am exhausted and will no longer struggle for my belonging in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again." ""</seg>
<seg id="2455">In 1851, Sojourner complained, "Am I not a woman?" and I refuse to uphold an ideology in which the black woman is a demented and marginalised entity.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropriation to drive their egocentric programme.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to close white women the importance of overlapping skin color and gender, because some of them will continue to teach the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to teach them for a better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different origins a home and to distinguish themselves from white feminism, still the word "feminism" is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to release myself wholeheartedly from feminism and connect myself to the movement of Womanism that was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than setting me up for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women in accordance with our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, author of the book Africana womana: Reclaiming (for example: Africa-Womanism: how we can recapture ourselves) speaks of the fact that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create rooms in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself of the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement that the black woman is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment, I can lift black women and women of other cultures, as I exist in this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and my being as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment where my life neither skipped nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abridged and edited version of the article entitled "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" from structural. the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# refusefraumatic), which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been modified to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner said Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner, who had become violent against her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Some time has passed since the end of their relationship, and the police said that their statement would be put to the files, but you can't do more.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another Ms. Balbuena showed maltreatment, Ada Báez's advert was not useful.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman withdrew her advertisement.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">In general, if women report an ad at all, they generally do not receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men whom they abuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit being victims of violence must be reported at all by law enforcement authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Content 1 impacts and statistic 2 Invisible acts and a legal system that has nothing to do with Paraguay's laws: good approach, faulty implementation impacts and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is hard to see how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social science research institution in Paraguay. "there are various statements and reports, which, however, do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay" explains them.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, 9600 ads were reported to the District Attorney Office on account of domestic violence. 70% of them were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the advertisements in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the peace courts. 86% of women's advertisements came here as well.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women claimed that they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan woman minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually indicated. "to any woman reported in Paraguay because of mental ill-treatment, 9 women who do not do so.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "two women who do not do this," "" "declared at the end of 2014 on any woman who will be refunded because of physical maltreatment." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since the murder of women in Paraguay is not a criminal offence, law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016, journalists numbered at least 12 cases of suicide in the country.</seg>

<seg id="2509">When I read about it, I always thought that this only happens to women who are too subservient because they are deceived by violent men.</seg>

<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the mistreatment by Carlos Vera.</seg>

<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had liked to please Carlos so long and did not leave him earlier.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, representation takes place with his agreement</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research performed on site: on the one hand, many medicines and vaccines are missing in the global health care portfolio that cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more severe effects in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment in the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research conducted by African scientists will help build their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Centre for Infectious Diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, when the AIDS epidemic revealed first serious implications for national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a post-doc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus before deciding to go back home to support the Sámi health system.</seg>

<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: currently the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the Sámi national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">I am also starting a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">CC: what do you think are the most important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always remain beneficiaries instead of being a creator himself.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not well usable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>

<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are funded differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, because funding and opportunities for development are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work you didn't have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and the internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">CC: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools in order to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on, and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I've seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special academic training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, study of space, health care (non-communicable and contagious illnesses) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will greatly benefit.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa versus Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often, it is the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that presents challenges here.</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine which reports on solutions to environmental issues around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding lettuce in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 sorts, such as Outorgeous, the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was set only by its own ingenuity and the question of how many kinds of lettuce he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents not only used for single varieties, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tonne or crimped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more plants have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or cartons. based on this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts for food security are concerned about the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton is still cultivating lettuce, but in the meantime he needs longer, since his work is increasingly difficult due to more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is as if in a river a boulder is lying around which I have to yodel." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do it now, but it's a break with the breeding-tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think that these patents go too far for salads." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand in court, no one can breed a new type of salad, because all the features are already patented. "so he continues to do as good as possible and tries to breed those characteristics he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and tries not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the USA and all over the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red Roman salat of the Outorgeous variety in the "greenhouse" of the station. it tests whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT sector and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for Open Source seed) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was founded to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can thus be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">Within the framework of the initiative called Ossi, US breeders can commit to the fact that others can freely use the seed bred by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it. "open source" breeders only allow others who purchase their seed, cross it in order to breed their own varieties, and do not immediately sow - two aspects which are banned or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Since its launch in 2014, dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative.</seg>
<seg id="2649">More dark views</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeritus professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi Management Board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants is both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds reportedly play a role in larger contexts like biodiversity, farmers' rights, control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to exploit the latter not or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open source" movement does not concern genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grains, genetically modified or not, from organic agriculture or not. "in order to reach our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed," he says, and thus participates in the increasingly common mergers in the global agribusiness, as it is offered in August and September 2016. "anyone who wants to buy good, locally and sustainably produced vegetables should also know that the manner in which this vegetables is bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to keeping their seed available free of charge. in contrast, their approach is in contrast to patent seed and plant features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available gene pool constantly shrinks due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material, which is thus always restricted.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about one third of all card features are protected as intellectual property, making it difficult for plant breeders to either not or only be harmed.</seg>
<seg id="2659">There are no such estimates for other plants, but experts such as Luby suggest that mass-grown plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of perception</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred in such a way that they have specifically desired traits - from such ones through which their taste or colour improves to such ones, because they thrive in certain environments and endure threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties suggest that the plant material available for breeders continues to take more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more important than ever since the changed conditions are much worse due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an email, Monsanto recognizes Carly Scaduto that genetic diversity is generally important and crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It contradicts, however, that intellectual property restricts other breeders because "patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation." a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expires.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "such protection does not inhibit innovation, but encourages them by providing the public with more material and know-how." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees things differently: to wait 20 years until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to breed plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is, however, that genetic resources have always been a general good and will continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it will be impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and latest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">"" "all in all, Morton interferes with the concept of patented plant features:" "" "we don't really create the features ourselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "he who breeds a variety also breeds his own values in them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation mass herbicides are needed, are breeding in its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exactly opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) patents, they manage most smaller seed companies to survive without patents - either they reject the patenting or they consider it to be too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for Salate in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also convinced that breeders by avoiding plant patents would be innovative: "it looks as though I was stronger than companies with my efforts to produce something new.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalog, as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years, "he says." with a patent you are protected for 20 years from competition, making it very easy to believe. "worldwide response</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the US seems to be a leader in open source breeding, the concept is rapidly spreading across the globe.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, carries out an "open-source" seed program. to preserve the seed of traditional crops, the centre works with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet specific requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">"" "it also supports them to come to" "" "open source" "" "seeds and sell their own." ""</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German Organization Agrecol works on an open-source licence, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of Ossi commitment to breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for breeding differ from country to country, so that the Ossi obligation cannot be easily adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable, thus addressing the current practice of the European Patent Office which allowed patents on conventionally bred plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">"" "" "" "however, an explanation is not yet a law; it is now time for the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line." ""</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organised a conference on "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the "open source" seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the patenting of seeds.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities are still blocking content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organization and blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend around 5 August, the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights abuses in Egypt and the Arab world and reports on the same.</seg>
<seg id="2724">August published the network an opinion on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities sharply criticized this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains abiding in this part of the world and to give victims a voice. even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals, it has never been as important as now. ANHRI acknowledges that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the blockage and not to yield. we insist on further fulfilling our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 web pages more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arab-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Qatar-based network of Al Jazeera because of alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1st Human Rights Organization of the wave of Website Uppermissions to the Victims. @ anhri one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Besides ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the dissemination of columns and articles which he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog he set up to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government was the goal of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider of which also Ziadas's blog is located, on the other hand, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 while he talked about the student protests and recorded a video of how police exerted physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles mainly revolve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the government's closure and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to lock is very old, however, has in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even if the blogging of the blog may not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) I managed to convey the feeling of a state of siege; an arrest, a attempted murder, a charge at the National Security Council, the blogs of blogs and any other web page I worked for.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I did not write for nothing. in other words, my words have influence, even if only to a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to post items to circumvent the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Now, however, after blocking it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave walk the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egypt authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 6 August. this resulted in technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and ETISALAT.</seg>
<seg id="2743">In addition, afte documented the blocking of vendors that were possible by bypassing internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afghan reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of web pages that VPNs offer began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice points to the government's intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users may have access to.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the situation is also worsened by the fact that the censorship decisions are taken behind closed doors, so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis through which it can proceed against these actions." ""</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants fight.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers in Brazil report with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "" "" "14-year-old shot in school," "" "every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro," "" "Thieves robbing pharmacy with military weapons" "", "" "" "President Timer sends 8500 soldiers to the army, navy and airfaraway to Rio." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "the newspaper" "" "Extra" "", "well-known for the detailed reporting of violence in Rio on August 16, published the Editorial" "" "This is not normal" "" "in which she announced to set up a new column called" "" "War in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The paper explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. whatever happens in the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the "War in Rio." (...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative, so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper stated that this decision was not a reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war break in a country that does not recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist explains that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourses, if it is distorted, can also be used to cover atrocities of the police, which only shoots and then asks questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it uses?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira argues against calling violence as a "war." this is, in her opinion, a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could complicate it to bring justice to the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated by the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historic and self-complying neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">As a reminder, the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2776">Photo by: Fernando Frazão / Agência Brasil. publication with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2777">According to Cecília, Rio de Janeiro describes as "the most violent place in Brazil:" 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to the statistics of 2015 in the north and north-east of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "when we look at the Mordrates per State, Rio is at number 16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">Extra belongs to the company Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, like Cecília, has been repeating the security policy of the state for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">These security policy measures included the creation of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003, whose goal is to capture a Favela by deploying a massive police fire and permanently stationing one unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually resulted in a decline of violent death. however, for some years now, the UPP was increasingly under fire after several reports of harassment and repression against the poor communities, which was supposed to protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux wrote from one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio will not comply with the criteria set out by the Geneva Conventions for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also entails serious consequences for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This requires the state to use means and ways typical of a war. to this end, penetration into the territory of a "enemy," where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "lost bullets."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War back or forth, the fact is that the inhabitants of Favelas continue to suffer in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">A week ago, the police cleared the mountain with the Favela Jacarezinho in order to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: a salesman died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to Worldwatch, a joint initiative of the Peace organisation PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and around the country, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The East Ghouta region is particularly affected, where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition are assuming that the massacre of the Assad regime was perpetrated on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege, resulting in local or tunnel and control points dependent on smuggled food.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Due to the years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own mushrooms as a "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms are not part of the traditional food eaten in Syria and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food is an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The right of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we chose to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because you can plant them in houses and cellars." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">"" "Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices that for three years this project has been fighting to make this project known and expressed his relief that it now gains more and more" "" "familiarity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2814">To collect money for the initiative, in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda, use the humanitarian Crowdfunding platform Cando.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to give 125 families a knowledge of planting mushrooms, "says Dr. Leila to Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of approximately 12,700 €, but will continue to collect donations to Cando until Monday 04 September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the shortage of fuel, locally produced fuel from plastic are used to supply generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">"" "Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they began with the" "" "production of mushroom seeds originating from regions" "" "before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption." ""</seg>

<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have spread mushrooms throughout the east of Ghouta free of charge.</seg>

<seg id="2832">Portuguese call for justice for the victims of fires in 2017</seg>
<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on October 21 in many District Capitals in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of fires raging in the north of Portugal in the week.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of October 15th and 16th. this led to the government's last week out of solidarity with the victims for three days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Brandies were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fires that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy occured in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest monitoring system, which monitors forest areas via satellite photographs, around 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can take a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is only a fire in 4 districts.</seg>

<seg id="2847">João Soveral from the League of Farmers of Portugal declared Público newspaper:</seg>
<seg id="2848">After Pedrógão, roads and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing.</seg>

""</seg>
<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of easily inflammable wood, like in a vicious circle, spread to fires of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2855">In addition to these problems, the website of civil protection from Portugal on October 15 and 16, when residents were looking for information or attempted to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that supplied the population with information: it took advantage of its own civil protection data with the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina to simplify the work of the fire brigade and this fateful weekend in October was so critical that the servers did not stand up to the onslaught of 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website counted more than half a million accesses.</seg>

<seg id="2873">One night in the autumn of 1994, the occupation of Afghanistan began by the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Two years earlier, a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin groups that had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. thus Afghanistan has become a country of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">At that time Ashark Barati, a 13-year-old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, was in the province of Ghazni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even though his mother did not say it at that time, she knew she would not see her son for a long time - maybe even more.</seg>

<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, came closer and closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Ashark found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was heavy and made him ill.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his little wage and went to Iran. once again he found himself in a foreign country with other refugees and dragged bags with mortar which were heavier than himself to make a living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, like today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," recalls Ashark in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the building site where we worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no service there and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we didn't freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Ashark left behind his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities had rejected his asylum application, Ashark returned to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time ago Ashark was homeless, ran through the streets of Rome alone, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that due to relatively high ratings, Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers. it is true, however, that the conditions for asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "the" "" "Civil Liberties Union for Europe" "" "human rights organisation writes, the system" "" "suffers from a general lack of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the large majority of asylum seekers are housed in more than 3000" "" "special reception centres" "". "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and careless personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to an admission centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can still be applied for months after the registration of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who don't have money for accommodation either rely on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Ashark.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his mortal friend helped Ashark to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After spending several years various works in the construction industry, Ashark put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharper Baratis's success story is now the subject of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") of the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">In 2017 the film won the Venice City Award, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">"" "" "" "lots of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles." ""</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to inofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years some Afghan enterprises have arisen, including tailor shops, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were praised even in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the peace & amp restaurant in Padua; Spice and also behind the Kabulogna Pizzeria in Bologna and a Sushi Restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Ashark's goals extend far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retail, and go back to the country he forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are opportunities," says Ashark with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as everyone else." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">"" "Ashark also designs plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packing and preservation techniques." "" "so they can sell their crop surpluses in the market and improve their financial situation," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end there is stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Ashark has made this journey himself. now he wants to help other Afghans in this way.</seg>

<seg id="2929">He reported about the evacuation of the camp Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo, protesting against the decomposition of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>

<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocaca's Netizen's Report is an international snapshot showing challenges, victories and emerging trends in global internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian Parliament reviews a draft bill that foresees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after registering with a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">In order to be able to use social networks, users must register within six months of successful law decision on the authority's website stating their full name and ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who missed this step could be sentenced to six months' imprisonment or the clearing of a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law passed by sixty parliamentary members is currently facing the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "in May another member of the Parliament presented a legislative proposal introducing tougher penalties for the insult to the president or a high officials." ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the law proposition, such an act would be punished with imprisonment and fines, as legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is passed, this can mean up to three years in prison for the condemned.</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would support a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photographs of violence against protesters who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of elected President Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan waited, like more than 700 participants, who had been arrested at the same incident, four years in prison for a trial date.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, the trial laid down on 20 May was postponed because the prison leadership failed according to human rights groups to bring the defendant from prison to the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan threatens the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, headlight on among other things weapons possession, illegal gathering, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal court in Giza was acquitted of the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were accused of their reporting to pro-Morsi seat blockade on Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The court also reduced the sentences of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the aforementioned incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activists to interrogated documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours hearing the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia has been mainly interrogated to a detailed action plan. said Plan descends from the President of the Republic who, according to the plan, explicitly supports a controversial bill of law, which would grant businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption, provided they return all unjustifiable money received.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on April 21 on the Nawaat website throws light on how presidential plans look to support the law.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia denounced the naming of his sources, stating article 11 of the Tunisian press code, which journalists have the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he appeared in the district court in Tunis on May 09 as a witness in the case.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force the users of social media to demonstrate their identity?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to the new regulations of the Information Office of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China need a permit before writing or sharing messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">It is also stated in the Regulations that registration with the full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts assume that this will allow the elimination of anonymous comments into conversations within social networks. it is up to now unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed social media to enforce these rules only selectively in order to protect citizen journalism and independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Do we see ourselves in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "according to Roskomnadzor, WeChat failed to register as the" "" "organizer of the dissemination of information" "" "in the state government." ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a law from 2014, thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that organize the "publication of information." the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing content and to force them on request for the suspension of user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These web pages currently include websites such as Vcontacts and Odnobyniks (Russia's two most popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, the e-mail service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court decrees Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court decreed Wikipedias in Turkey, after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English-speaking articles, the information that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">The Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communication announced that the site was blocked because it was "an information source that cooperates with groups in order to foment a political diffusion campaign against Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website. it is, among other things, China, one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Great Britain can't stop sniffing</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week of leaked documents, Britain's government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with increased surveillance powers that would force Internet Service Providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor programs that encode data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunications companies and intelligence agencies regarding the proposal, but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outwardly.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation is still running until May 19. reactions and proposals from members of the public may be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>

<seg id="2994">We are mourning together with them about the loss of so many innocent lives and condemning terrorism, as well as all other forms of violence committed to people because of their sexuality, gender identity and expression of sex. in China, violence occurs on a daily basis, such as through bullying of LGBTQ teenagers in schools, generally discriminatory treatment and in the use of therapies with the aim of "healing gay and bisexual people."</seg>
<seg id="2995">Blued, China's most popular dating app for homosexuals, changed its loading screen, which now shows the words "we stand with Orlando" (for example: page on page with Orlando).</seg>
