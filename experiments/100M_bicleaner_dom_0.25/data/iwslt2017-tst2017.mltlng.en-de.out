this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times repor@@ ter .
long before someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally listened to phones by Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally gave Iran designs for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter at all ?
the U.S. government .
the government fought against Ris@@ en for nearly 10 years and asked him to call his alleged sources .
in this move he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and spy on journalists .
according to the First Constitution , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to use this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous they reveal .
so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many courageous repor@@ ters had done before him : he refused and said he would rather go to jail .
between 2007 and 2015 Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , although they have said for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped at risk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the repor@@ ters and sources can hide more and less .
instead of failure and ris@@ king to make statements , it could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have kept their phone calls secret ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , his credit rating , and even travel warnings with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey ster@@ ling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s alleged source .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers at his departure , but instead , justice has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of their work as a secret .
since September 11 almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower going to a journalist .
so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional amend@@ ment , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on everyone .
but just as the government &apos;s technology allows journalists to circum@@ vent the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and they can do that from the moment they contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand .
today there is communication software that did not yet exist when Ris@@ en wrote his book , and it &apos;s much safer than regular emails or phone calls .
such a technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open source transition system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work .
instead of sending an email , go to a news site like the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , just like with any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server that only the respective news agency has access .
so the government can no longer obtain information secretly , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the start .
Secure@@ Ball , however , is only a small part of the whole in order to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies that thre@@ aten us all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to ensure that not only technology experts like Edward Snow@@ den have a chance to bring mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ stle @-@ b@@ lower , &quot; &quot; &quot;
or the next environmental officer who is alert to the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall Street insi@@ der that warns us of the next financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crime but to protect our constitutional rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
&#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that rich and mighty &#93; have hidden &#91; enormous sums of money in tax ha@@ v@@ ens &#93; &#91; What does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to explain this week &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness &#93; this week . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness &#93; this week . &#93;
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s Prime Minister res@@ ig@@ ned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has let@@ ter@@ box companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is said that a track of $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , a close friend from childhood , a famous cell@@ ist .
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release , and on the next revealed documents .
now it sounds like the plot of an agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
it seems to we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and this concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
throughout the world , media and leading politicians , how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by a few , to hide and disgu@@ ise their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people seem to be very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ yo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures .
it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters is .
I also find it interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the USA .
presumably because there have not been any prominent American who came to this sc@@ andal in these revelations .
now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but through the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens function , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer American customers .
if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US .
in fact , in some US states there is less information needed to provide less information to form a company than to get a library card .
this type of transparency in the United States has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed fraud to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to find out how all this is in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 attorney firms in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really shocked us that all up to a lawyer our investig@@ ator made proposals on how to transfer his money .
none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was given money . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as an individual case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a single leading politi@@ cian involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and in order to cope with this , we have to change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this type of behavior difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it may sound very angry as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I think a lot has started to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years , we have seen more transparency about what concerns the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the theme found political attention from British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the EU has been gathering in central registers at national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the USA is la@@ gging behind here .
representatives of both parties have introduced a draft law in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us in Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy who get up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and commit to ending this type of transparency by law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together we can finally end the in@@ transparency that now allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing .
this is the story I once almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a sale of the farm .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stood and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip through the whole country . after that he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me enthusi@@ astically how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake asking him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the Peace Corps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to be kidn@@ apped in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small boot !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Does it please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I lay in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what did I get lost there ?
a stranger is sleeping in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what if he &apos;s crazy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed , sh@@ ook my toes to the door , and my bedroom door closed .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art that he had bought from me hangs today in his class@@ rooms . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my point of view .
perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers to me were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered ?
having people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress with me .
let &apos;s take a time jump , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate is moving out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe creativity can create fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could deserve something . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , plus a mattress and each morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on the wooden floor .
they found it super , and we too .
I am sure our Che@@ ese hams om@@ el@@ ets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we said good@@ bye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and me star@@ ed .
had we just discovered that we could also find new friends and pay our rent ?
things came rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ ek@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if this could be a business concept .
so we presented to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors one closes when you come by .
on the internet , they can invite wild people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we were waiting for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
but they are not .
no one who is still in sol@@ ace would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we as children have all learned that strangers are dangerous .
when you have a problem , you are contempl@@ ating the things you can do well . we were able to design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before .
can Design be something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of what degree of confidence we strive for .
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone in your hand .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
enter your locked mobile phone to your left sitting area .
this quiet flight of panic you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile of a stranger in your hands ?
most people feel the responsibility .
most guests feel like they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason can our company exist .
just like that , who actually has Al Gor@@ es mobile ?
could you please announce on Twitter that he is running for the office of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of confidence we want to build . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had just presented himself with his name ; if he had told wh@@ ence he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you had 150 assessments that all say : &quot; he can hold very well @-@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to hand in your mobile phone ?
a well thought @-@ out feedback system will strengthen confidence .
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for the people to give away negative jud@@ gements .
finally , we decided to wait for both hosts and guests to leave their assessments before we placed them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we looked at how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are in terms of age and place of residence .
not surprisingly , we trust people most who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it is exciting to add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by assessments .
if you have less than three assessments , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation deri@@ ves common ground .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that confidence depends on how much you are going to buy .
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; tell too much , as for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is also rather not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great works of art in your apartment ! I do holiday with my family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which subjects you should write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against foreigners .
what we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to put aside these prejudi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people take advantage of our offer .
you can see three things .
first : unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
thir@@ dly , a need previously not covered .
the business is running very well for us .
of course , there are times when things are not going smoothly .
there were guests who have not allowed parties or have devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have guests staying in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront when confidence was broken .
there &apos;s nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I think just about it .
the disappointment that one hears in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will continue to be our greatest motivation to further improve .
fortunately , over 123 million overnight stays had only a fraction of a problem .
for people are tru@@ sting each other .
if trust works , it can create wonderful things .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood to the necessary surgery !
here is his judgement :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect home for travelers who are prone to heart attacks due to sitting activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who rescue a life even though they don &apos;t know one correctly .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want one to feel lonely , they bring books over .
you can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
this way , of course , not every stay exp@@ ires .
but these relations behind the mere money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it &apos;s about an economic trade here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not just the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to mention , the thing is not fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade which promises human relationships .
people place a portion of themselves openly , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , it &apos;s easy to compare with fast food . it &apos;s efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if at any place you visit , a group of locals would wait to complete a thoroughly and show you a quarter of which you have never heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
today , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments from the ground up to the other ?
what would this look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of joint participation ?
I imagine cities that allow society and relationships , rather than lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
this project has already begun in South Korea &apos;s capital , Seoul . lots of parking spaces belonging to the government ,
were now offered residents . students who were looking for a residence ,
were taught to people whose children had gone out . incub@@ ator programs were started ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the share economy , 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries alone will be a guest of a stranger or even a host over our platform alone .
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we didn &apos;t re @-@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
there was also hospitality before .
there were similar websites in front of us .
so why did our work just work ?
apart from happiness and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find it amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da goes past me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use design soon .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or oppressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t blame you for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people who look like me .
one study found that 80 % of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that the Americans think most of them would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a w@@ ann@@ abe @-@ fitness fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga singing , because , baby , I was not born like that .
I decided to do so .
when I was 17 , I decided to ou@@ ten myself .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual man , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was that at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence , in comparison to the pressure I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt myself to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents passi@@ vely .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Quran .
I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devotion deep@@ ening with every reading of the Qur &apos;@@ an .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , fully understands you , and yet loves you somehow ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I got married and started as all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then that terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; Eil@@ een . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew into buildings , people jump@@ ed out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a Technical Dis@@ order ?
my shock quickly turned into anger .
why should we do such a thing ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I switched to the TV channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh my God .
it is not only my country that has been attacked , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others turned me into a susp@@ ects .
on the same day we had to travel through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start post@@ graduate studies .
I remember how I went sil@@ ently -- as deeply moved into my seat , and I was afraid for the first time to be recognized as Muslims .
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be vi@@ gil@@ ant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ke@@ ep in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t be sam@@ pled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather to pray .
and again the warnings came : &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot;
I watched the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or of people held for Muslims , dra@@ gged into the open and smote .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something didn &apos;t feel right .
because the people who attacked this land attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have put the anger of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the accus@@ ations that are tough . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims .
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumor in the body of the US but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympic athletes .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America more secure ?
maybe there will be a couple of parking spaces , but not stopping terror .
regular visit to a mos@@ que causes people to consider other beliefs more toler@@ ant , and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington area recently told me : people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
in the process of ra@@ dic@@ alization , it has been established that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from her community , even from her family , so that the extrem@@ ist group can make a bra@@ in@@ washing that causes the terrorists to be the true Muslims , and anyone who h@@ ates their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or distra@@ c@@ ted by faith .
if we want to prevent ra@@ dic@@ alization , we must stop people to go to the mos@@ que .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would fit into their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , like the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x cl@@ one with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups asser@@ t their ideology grounds on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Book &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when one looks at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; Holy Scriptures . &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into the scriptures .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she pre@@ tended to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every minister with whom she had spoken brought them to silence and told her that their anger , their sense of injustice in the world , would only bring them into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to her anger she was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts that promised her a solution .
this Ima@@ m restored the connection to God and her church .
instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive way for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept them from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an author@@ itarian system of government , conformity and prejudi@@ ce .
a study shows that if people submit news reports that have a negative impact on Muslims , they rather agree to military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you see when the mood against Muslims f@@ lowed up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool for manipul@@ ating the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all .
the assignment of collective guilt is not only about having to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .
De@@ ah was an ath@@ lete .
he was at the dental Faculty , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when did such an experienced young man become from my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , killed her , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting the afternoon . he did it in her apartment as in a execution after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot dead eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or were we safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , as it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely ex@@ ert our religion .
we decided for the mos@@ que .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat we drove silent , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took it out , took off my shoes , walked into the prayer hall , and what I saw made me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assembled crowd were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had taken courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or you will join those who think that we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who might say that you &apos;re holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with drau@@ ght , working in a noble think tank , so an exception and not a rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as ordinary as it is allowed .
if you look at Muslims all over the world , and I did this with the largest study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I &apos;m in no way an exception .
when people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a billi@@ on@@ aire business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air package delivery penet@@ rated into our social awareness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six @-@ meter high tower of 1 500 bricks . some years ago they began to fly with ropes .
together , flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test of spaces .
you can also build self @-@ winding structures .
they have learned to wear loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to transc@@ end the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it must collectively know where the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine the calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available on highest level e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flying machine trying to hit two flies with a flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in the forward flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
unlike most celeb@@ ri@@ ties , it can float , and has great benefits when starting and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the flying machine doesn &apos;t matter what position the optimal position can be achieved and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often face basic abstract questions that come to the heart of the matter .
such a question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
for example , helicop@@ ters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts coming together to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots could fly away remotely controlled flying machines that had only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with just one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechanically easiest remote @-@ operated flight machine . it was invented short .
it has only a moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no flap , hing@@ es and cross ru@@ dder , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechanically simple , inside life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move anywhere in the room .
however , it does not have the elegant rear @-@ starter algorithm . to get it to fly I have to throw it right .
the lik@@ el@@ ihood of getting it right is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the sp@@ inner is an exercise in pleasure , this machine is here , the Omni@@ head with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
therefore it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
in doing so , he receives the extraordinary ability ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter in which direction it is rot@@ ated or even rot@@ ated .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers from the eight prop@@ ellers .
some are imagin@@ able in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let us look at it .
when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine here consists of two separate twin prop@@ eller aircraft .
this turns clock@@ wise
and the other counter @-@ clock@@ wise .
when one builds them , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller fails , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly even though limited .
we will demonstrate this by making half f@@ light@@ less .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression .
we took commercial micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with loc@@ alization technologies and algorithms .
each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine over there wants to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology .
for guys like us lies the reward in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
three billion years ago , two black holes surrounded each other in a very distant gal@@ axy , so they turned the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second in pure energy .
this short moment they lit up bri@@ ghter than all the stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the whole us known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
their energy , however , did not set them free in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was em@@ itted into space @-@ time @-@ structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us first arrange the events in time .
more than 1.3 billion years ago , a multi @-@ cell life had just emerged on Earth .
since then the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God is standing at us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly brave -- Ra@@ i Weiss decided to build a huge laser detector from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which arise by col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the Det@@ ector Lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ omet@@ er- gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves @-@ observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of Lig@@ o was significantly increased , which greatly improved the recognition performance .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ro@@ amed through the earth through the two conflic@@ ting black holes .
they went through you and me
and through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of My Dau@@ ghter
and the farewell to my sick father .
in essence these were the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes and her through observ@@ atories such as lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cra@@ mp@@ ing in the structure of space and time .
when crossing the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and squee@@ zed into the other .
for illustration , teachers often perform a properly alpine dance in courses on rel@@ ativity theory .
&quot; stretch and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched out and st@@ out at the arrival of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this means 20 zer@@ os according to the comm@@ a followed by a 1 . that &apos;s why the Lig@@ o staff was ins@@ ane .
with a five kilometer laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured in less than one thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of an atomic nucle@@ us . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; &quot; &quot; described by Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott says that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile phone .
this is quite practical , as you can create an image or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming around you from several points .
with sounds it &apos;s different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you :
about your child &apos;s face .
instead , we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and volume , rhythm and volume in order to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now Alice is talking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob breaks them down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; du@@ mmer Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe speak .
to listen to the gra@@ vit@@ ation can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott already worked very long .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , chir@@ ping simply : w@@ up@@ p !
if the two bodies turn very fast , you can hear the same pair of p@@ ups with an additional key change . that sounds like wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a type of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed in the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date at least I will never forget -- &#91; Sur@@ render sound &#93; Any@@ one who knows what he has to hear , acknow@@ le@@ dges this as sound from -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rotate around as fast as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , cir@@ cl@@ ed one hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know because we heard it .
therein lies the permanent significance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o is pav@@ ing the way for an entirely new way to explore the universe , as it had never been possible before .
on this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in space -- practically or basically -- cannot be seen .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ i@@ che stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ as .
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about the universe .
however , the exciting physical processes take place in the nucle@@ us , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never go through since these are op@@ aque .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them since the Big B@@ ang is obsc@@ ured by its own glow .
with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that there are things that we have never seen before , which we will never see and of which we have no idea at all . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt , which we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , such as Lig@@ o , they are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are , so to speak , the din@@ osau@@ r bones for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different angle of view of the events in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as bold as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
you dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to everything I was afraid of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak in public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be on TV live ?
no , but yes !
did I start playing the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly that to do what I was afraid of , eliminated my fear .
my fear of keeping speeches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has changed my life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply , to an unexpected way . it began with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cookies , I need milk for my be@@ ak cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new attitude to life in my family . from then on I have been disturbed to always play with them once you call me to do so . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , on our family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has a start@@ ling side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say to play with my children saved my career . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think of things , stir you up to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I produce television .
I make television , in a great style .
in this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program in the world .
four television programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each broadcast offers hundreds of jobs that previously did not exist .
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode all nine days of four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three programmes that simultaneously are in production , times four , 16 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV ,
$ 350 million for a season .
in America my TV series runs one after the other on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself , and not only produced , so far above . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around camp fire and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fires that burn around the world .
do you know who still does that ?
no one , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with it .
I say it because I know what you think if the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you that all of you who work as hard as you run a company , a country or a classroom , take me seriously when I talk about work , so you understand that I don &apos;t just move around the computer and f@@ anci@@ er , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it &apos;s not about dre@@ aming in a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I am deep@@ ened in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it is as if I set up troops , as I painted on a canvas .
as if you have a high sound , run a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love working .
she is creative , mechanical , ar@@ du@@ ous and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible . and the best thing about it is the h@@ um .
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy street , I could always drive on it .
many people assume that I explain the sums to them that I &apos;m talking about writing that writing makes me happy .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does .
but the h@@ um -- when I began working and working with TV production , when I began working and working , building , creating and working together , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz , this energy .
the sum is more than writing .
the sum is action and activity . the sum is a drug .
the hum@@ ming is music . the hum@@ ming is light and air .
the sum is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum , then you can &apos;t strive for size differently .
the feeling of not being able to strive for size no matter what price .
this is called the sum .
or maybe it means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it &apos;s called genius .
maybe it &apos;s ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I am not made for failure , and I only know that I love the sums .
I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make one thing clear : the more successful I become , the more broad@@ casts , the more episodes , the more work there are , the more things are , the more I write history , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the h@@ um , the h@@ um , the bu@@ zz .
I like this sum . I love the sum .
I need the sum . I am the sum .
am I just this sum ?
and then the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burned out .
the sum stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that her mo@@ m is a single working title .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mo@@ m will not be there , but you can write to my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estim@@ ating , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the tot@@ als stopped .
the hum@@ ming of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t love my work any more . the engine was off .
the sum did not come back .
my hum@@ ming was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours days , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing to deleg@@ ate , a Titan does not sleep , doesn &apos;t give up , with all the heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no hum@@ ming .
in me was silence .
four television programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no more fun .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum and the bu@@ zz I was .
so what do you do when what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heu@@ l aus , stupid author @-@ titanium &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do it , you do it , you love what you do , to be a teacher , to be a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives you the bu@@ zz when you know the sums , when you stop the h@@ um , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern member wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no more than two things become aware of :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I must say Yes to all and second , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estim@@ ating &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she calls no one more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estim@@ ating &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did this happen ?
I miss it when I &apos;m a Titan and I steal my sums , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding , because my pain and panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of money , I can do nothing except watch out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and moist kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door opens and an energy boost comes in .
and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens , it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz comes back slowly .
no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the sum , but a sum .
and now I feel like I know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the cause .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no mystery . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the working environment , the titanium um@@ ming , that &apos;s just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am when I describe myself with the help of shows and TV sessions and how functioning my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is .
the sums are not force and it is not work @-@ specific .
it depends on the pleasure .
the real hum@@ ming depends on love .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing is the stream that comes from the lust of life .
the real hum@@ ming is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real hum@@ ming ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure .
the real hum@@ ming is simple and original .
the real hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , because which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is simply love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a fixed rule so that I can liber@@ ate myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic from any guilt .
it is law , I have no choice . I have no other choice unless I want to hear the sums again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not close to me as I work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer to work at work as at home .
this admission is painful because what a person would rather work than to be at home ?
well , yes , I .
hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I &apos;m too relaxed is not one of them .
we rush around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we do small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
I feel mostly stiff , absent and confused .
I always use my mobile phone .
but it &apos;s ok .
my children show me how to live , and the sum of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can do it too ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you consider me na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ aming .
you &apos;re right , but you can do it too !
they have time !
and do you know why ? they &apos;re not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or bis@@ cuit replaced me .
and when my teen @-@ daughter speaks with me for about 15 minutes , I am the mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , there is no more need .
everyone can spend 15 minutes on the track , even on a bad day !
15 minutes in a piece !
no mobile phone , no clothes , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children ready for bed .
but 15 minutes are in it !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . they don &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the hum@@ ming , to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and keep it out .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I &apos;m winning . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is just for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in education when I wanted to exceed myself more and more .
15 minutes a piece , why not take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum came back in my spare time . the sum seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working doesn &apos;t work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the sum , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sum , the sum is not me ... no more .
bubble and sti@@ cky finger , dinner with friends .
this is my hum@@ ming now .
the h@@ um of life .
the sum of love .
the sum of work is part of me , but only one part . and I am so thank@@ ful for that .
it is snow@@ ing to me that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan to travel to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my camp@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clearer my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum . the country I create , the marathon , which I run , the troops , the screens , the high sound , the sums , the sums , the other , the right sums : the sum of life .
the more I feel this sum , the more this unusual , consistent , bare and new feeling of life is spreading within me . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel this sum , the more I know who I am .
I am a writer . I think of things , I stir you up to life .
that is part of the job , which means living your dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to the next , after a severe stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after severe injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent disability .
this is probably the reason why I was a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor trying to improve nerve functions through various surgical procedures .
they have certainly heard of one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; deep @-@ brain stimulation . &quot; they im@@ planted a electrode deeply in the brain to influence the neur@@ ons &quot; circu@@ it@@ ry so that the neuro@@ logical function improved .
it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease who suffered from violent trem@@ ors and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is to restore the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help , the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often provided patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
they must imagine that in skull @-@ brain trau@@ mata the brain sw@@ ells and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
to save life , you have to reduce the pressure of the skull .
for this you sometimes have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
being able to grow cells from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families .
you have to find proper nutrition , temperature , humidity and environments to thri@@ ve .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François was able to do so .
he saw this under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you know from biology classes that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can transform into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells were different .
they split slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved otherwise .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the fet@@ us stage they are responsible for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so sure .
but one thing is clear -- of these cells we got our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source , which enables brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and then color them in color to track them in the brain .
in the last step we reim@@ proved them at the acceptance test of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- Aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we reim@@ port these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what happens if we reim@@ port the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario we reim@@ planted the cells in a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added an injury to and reim@@ planted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we were able to observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have reim@@ planted them .
the evidence they show are those little points . these are the cells that we color in vitro , in culture .
of course we couldn &apos;t stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take pellets from a tray .
they made it very good .
when they had reached a stable level of skill we hurt the motor skills range in the Mot@@ orized Cor@@ tex .
after that the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand any more .
just as it would happen in humans , they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ sed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just as with monkeys .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we implant his own cells .
on the left you see the monkey who recovered spontaneously .
it can generate about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance prior to injury .
it is not as precise and not as fast .
now see , when we reim@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the implantation .
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have discovered a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze it and use it later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ pl@@ ore it in humans .
I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno Giuss@@ ani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know someone who can need it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials involving human beings .
Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , you have to fill in about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this type of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate and so on .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to look further into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first of all , it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select patients to perform treatments and assess whether it is useful to do this type of treatment .
then you have to apply it to a multi @-@ center study .
first you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as imm@@ utable feelings .
we believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his big im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , democracy is wan@@ ing with us , in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clari@@ fied as finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- would not influence the austerity programs realized in Greece .
at that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my bud@@ ding friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce you to an economical model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group are mistaken , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and defensive democracy .
for without democracy our societies are pav@@ ing our way , our future ble@@ ak and our great new technologies are wasted .
on the subject of extravag@@ ance , I would like to point out to you an interesting parad@@ ox that is currently threatening our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin summit parad@@ ox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt , which th@@ rows its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognise the debt mountain ,
but few recognize its twin .
a mountain of unused cash , which belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations , who are too afraid to invest there where it would be productive and income to produce the debt and also produce all the things that mankind urgently needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past three months , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars have been invested in the United States , England and the euro zone , in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , rails , equipment and so on and so on .
3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until it compar@@ es with the 5.1 billion US dollars , which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did absolutely nothing except to infl@@ ate the stock markets and raise real estate prices .
thus , debt and un@@ productive capital are the twin peaks that are not equ@@ alled by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ gering wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand , which , like in a continuous loop , increases the pes@@ si@@ mis@@ m of investors who , in fear , the prophecy of the ro@@ cket could be true that his son would kill him if he is grown up ,
un@@ intentionally causing the circumstances that cause the body to kill it .
this is my Ha@@ des with Cap@@ ital@@ ism --
all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents , and to finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth .
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue , what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
of course , the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy closed too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy on account of these exclu@@ sions .
the decisive thing in the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it with@@ drew the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which they granted them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same vote of vote in questions of state concerns .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long --
like a candle that shines brigh@@ tly , it is also quickly burned out .
however , our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies have not rooted their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , which ultimately became a by@@ word for rulers .
the liberal democracy first arose when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was dra@@ fted on politics , while the economy -- the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone .
in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , there is a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two , by gradually under@@ mining politics and escap@@ ing it .
are you wondering why the politicians are no longer as they used to be ?
it is not due to a degeneration of their DNA .
it is because today one can be in the government and yet not in power , because the power is immig@@ rated from politics into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my sh@@ arks with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of pre@@ dat@@ ors that sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals from which it feeds , that it star@@ ves at the end .
it is similar to the economy which has can@@ ni@@ bal@@ ised politics itself in such a way that it har@@ ms itself through the self @-@ caused economic crisis . the power of corporations grows , political goods are exploited , the macro@@ economic demand is rising , and the directors of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest in the cash of their businesses .
the more successful capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind .
if this is true , it is obvious that we must re@@ unite the politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; keeps control , as in ancient Athens , aside from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Mar@@ xi@@ an Left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go too well .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
but there is a solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism is doing it by replacing low @-@ wage workers with automation and robots .
the problem is that so long economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks grow higher , the wa@@ sting more sub@@ lime , and social conflicts deeper , just as it -- already very soon , as I think -- in countries like China will come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we need to re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the fields of economy and politics and make sure that we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy that makes the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a documentary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements which it has produced .
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; matrix , &quot; in which machines serve human beings and people put their energy into the exploration of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long talks indul@@ ging in the meaning of life .
I think we may be optim@@ istic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so what would it be like to have this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples .
in the field of companies : please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next , from one firm to the next , and the company -- no matter where you are currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company .
then all revenues come from capital and from revenues and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction between those who belong to companies , but who do not work in it , and employees who work there , but who do not belong to the firm . no exchange between capital and labour , no great gaps between investment and saving , and ultimately no rising twin peaks .
in the field of global political economy , please briefly imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency that is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity .
suppose the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a mutual fund .
imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
today , we have them , especially against the backdrop of a re@@ unified policy and economy .
the world I describe to you is at the same time liberal , in which they preferred privileged persons , and Marxist because they will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global Key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
we will wake up in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or are we going to sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Giuss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liberal Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I have just said is relevant then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... do we not do that , technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand , meaning Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from a part of Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will dest@@ abili@@ ze not only our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant ,
just like Ha@@ ye@@ k , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am also completely confused .
BG : indeed , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough .
BA : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said this . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers , you have very clearly stated what you think of the West &apos;s view to China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most plays out -- the sphere of economics -- is a completely democratic zone .
in a sense , if I dare to say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China resembles the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to link liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically regarded .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical about democratic development .
what we can observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China now propos@@ ing to do what the West has done in the 19th century has a huge smell of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I sen@@ sed that it &apos;s coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later to the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely , to say good@@ bye to us by compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the continuous den@@ ial that a massive fault line went through the euro@@ zone , and continues to massi@@ vely thre@@ aten the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which by the way , was the first proposal to reveal this den@@ ial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro area , within the Euro Group , have continued to elect the den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what comes .
that is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one tries to maintain an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , it may be delayed for a while , but when the changes occur , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we don &apos;t change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- serious ...
if there is a minister of finance , or any minister who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he has made no mistake , then that is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the len@@ ders &apos; pages to find a common solution .
but there was no such thing .
they just wanted to bring down our government , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions running through the euro@@ zone .
they did not want to admit that they had been implementing a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika who imposed this policy on us was saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of the talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my greatest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if it does not survive , the exposed centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , according to which it appears to me , it will also be det@@ ri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being with TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
of Roy Price most have never heard , even though he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision Roy hit three years ago .
Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a hed@@ geho@@ g and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Films , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course this is a very hard fought industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy does not have any choice .
he has to find shows very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right of this curve .
this graph is the evaluation distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this rating is received .
if your show is valued at nine and higher , it is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
that &apos;s shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows addic@@ tive where , after seeing a relay , your brain asks : &quot; where are more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what &apos;s going on at this end of the curve .
Roy Price doesn &apos;t worry about getting on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to sign &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the average spin , average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t am@@ a@@ ze .
so he has to make sure he is really on the right side .
the pressure is present and of course it is also the first time Amazon is doing something so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything .
he wants to create success .
he needs guaranteed success , so he is holding a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where they can watch everyone free of charge .
and if Amazon releases things for free , do you access , right ?
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you record when to start the show when you pause , which parts you over@@ lap or look again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and make the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they did this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show , because it wasn &apos;t so good .
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
approximately at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always on the look@@ out to find them a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different .
instead of organizing a competition , he and his team have looked at the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the ratings they give to the shows , their course , what shows they like , etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : which shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together , they took a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com about four Sen@@ ators , but a drama series via a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
there are two very competitive , data @-@ sealed companies .
they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this about ?
because logic somehow means that it should work in everything .
if you collect millions of data for a decision you make , you should make a good decision .
one has 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work in such a way , it is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time where we can access more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anyone know the Multi @-@ Health Systems company here ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software . come into contact , you are in prison .
if someone is in jail in the US and asks for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge takes place or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . that &apos;s not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the most experienced companies are wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that data analysis can predict out@@ breaks of flu , a bad way -- through data analysis of Google searches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it worked perfectly , year by year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work any more ,
and no one could say why .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it just didn &apos;t work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the most experienced companies like Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data stream into decisions of life -- at the workplace , in the case of law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very smart people use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for a cancer therapy .
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dis@@ semin@@ ated .
if you ever have to solve a complex problem , do two things :
as a first you disman@@ tle this problem into its parts so that you can analyse the individual parts ; as a second you put together the individual parts together to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then to make a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it : our brain .
when there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to re@@ assemble parts and pieces , even if the information is incomplete in order to make a good decision -- especially when it &apos;s the brain of an expert .
therefore , I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise not have been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; does not stand in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant they took a big personal risk with this decision .
on the other hand , Amazon did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their choices , first when they were competing for TV ideas , then when they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what the data say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things are going wrong when data start controlling our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data is just a tool , and in order not to forget , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it &apos;s also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No @-@ question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will fight it later with a technical demonstration .
I have made some decisions in my life so far , and I should have heard in hin@@ d@@ sight on the ball .
however , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it with a little more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so maybe the ball is smar@@ ter and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately it &apos;s up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions , to be an expert in what you do and take risks .
because in the end it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
