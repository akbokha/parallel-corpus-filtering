Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view of the city
an Irish institution , where young people are to meet today .
a chapel that is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn ( S @-@ Bahn ) tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers manage the former cause of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories to day .
it is annoying if maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows this , who had to get excited , because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the state government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but especially very informative .
especially if you compare it with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Mer@@ cury since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria Atlas is a Fli@@ ck@@ ent@@ ep@@ p@@ ich , which one recognizes as such .
in the large overview map , detailed maps for cities and municipalities were incorporated , so @-@ called Ur@@ posi@@ tional She@@ ets .
these were created according to the Bay@@ erische Staats@@ gem@@ ungs@@ verwaltung between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army captain occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon desired an overview of the occupied country and commissioned Bavaria &apos;s top@@ ographic survey - of course for military purposes .
even though the French troops were finally pulled off with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 , they were the current neighbours who created the idea of a covering Bavaria card .
Elec@@ tor Max IV further drove the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian Association of Sur@@ veying .
the composition sheet for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like all others on the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek &apos;s website .
the comparison of former / today is most impressive in the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was established 21 years after the map was created , thus in 18@@ 77 , as a Munich subur@@ b .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is situated in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser only in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : zo@@ oming in appears a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbered fle@@ ets from the so @-@ called &quot; pri@@ me@@ val &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
small plots are no longer occupied by farmers , but farmers in the &quot; land in the sun &quot; system .
a large green area is distinguished north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the scene of the Oktober@@ fest since 18@@ 10 , was in fact a meadow - and not a concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the area of today &apos;s Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen district , one reads not only the street name &quot; at Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; or from the &quot; Auf der Lü@@ ften &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once closed people with del@@ u@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich district @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ berg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was created there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden was the head of the institution - a psychiat@@ rist in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended up for example the chains of the so @-@ called Irish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he prohibited the staff to resort to violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen museum , who worked for an exhibition with the institution .
there was space for 280 patients , later it was expanded to 500 places .
at some point this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in Haar@@ 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ vals , has been located there since 2006 .
young people in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um meet on the grounds of the former Au@@ er Institute .
the Order purchased the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth hostel with training facilities .
West is the football field of the TS@@ V München East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was built - in an architectural reference to the original construction of the Ir@@ ren@@ berg , which had been destroyed during the Second World War during bomb attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 18@@ 56 , the shopping street called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War brought a decisive change also in the heart of Munich .
in December 1944 , the Al@@ lied bombs destroyed many holes in the city centre .
a big one remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days were the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn pedi@@ gree will take place .
with the sli@@ der you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil Rights group announces travel warnings for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for Far@@ mers &apos; Promotion has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which will enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , asks A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American travellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to pay special attention when travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , racial @-@ based occur@@ ren@@ ces occur in the entire state and are noted here , &quot; says the Group &apos;s opinion .
a recently passed law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to gain discrimination , as well as the state prosec@@ uting authorities , who are dispro@@ portion@@ ately aimed at minorities , prompted the group to release travel warnings , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are killed or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
the group cited incidents like rac@@ ist crime against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state and was put into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points out a recent report from the Mis@@ sour@@ i General@@ ate Office in which black mot@@ orists in the state will be held 75 percent more often than white .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be willing to bring ch@@ ewing money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i posted 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the F@@ BI &apos;s hate crime report that classi@@ fies the state with respect to the number of such violations on the 16th place of the country .
the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it harder to su@@ e a company for housing or employment discrimination .
earlier , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after States had passed immigration laws , comm@@ itting local law enforcement agencies to arrest people because of immigration violations , which will contribute to further racial profil@@ ing in view of the AC@@ L@@ U .
travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
the electric fence project is elementary
the Fisch@@ bacher Hof @-@ Wei@@ de@@ j@@ n @-@ Project is a successful project and will continue next year .
the CD@@ U Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac provided an image on site .
in the panel of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family representatives of the Fischer@@ bacher CD@@ U village association met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ u@@ ties .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially gave insights into his farm , in which he cultivated 55 hectares of law@@ ns and 40 hectares of forest , 40 milk cows and also many young animals and accommodated in five apartments holiday guests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the alternative marketing path for him for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the holiday guests only regional comes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as he is also the B@@ L@@ H@@ V chairman of Fisch@@ bach , he described the electric fence project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary important &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot generate profit on such steep areas .
the green area care for a lot of work , a lot must be processed with the brus@@ h@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if it did not lead to organic farming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the municipality has recognised the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported .
it is hoped that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the land could be extended quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they will continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers often stand in criticism because of the promotion
a total of 25 par@@ c@@ els were fenced off by 11 participants in 2013 .
the conservation area is therefore 40 hectares , which must not be aff@@ or@@ ested by at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total cost of 71 500 Euros , half was promoted over leader , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fisch@@ bach .
this means that the farmers had to invest 12,@@ 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of pasture fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ gevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job without farmers and mer@@ ma@@ ids . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter White stood firm : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Coun@@ try@@ side ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg grants the state funding of soft f@@ ences .
the aim is to open the Black Forest .
the prerequisite is the presence of a grant set by the L@@ PR .
in addition , the area to be en@@ umer@@ ated must not be servi@@ ce@@ able ( incl@@ ination over 35 per cent ) and must therefore be threatened by aff@@ or@@ estation .
the application of eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els , which would like to build 16 kilometres of fence , is currently running for the f@@ isher &quot; Fisch@@ bacher Hof &apos; in 2018 .
the accounting area equ@@ als 35 hectares , the calculated costs lie at more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing sacred ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos pla@@ za in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump ré@@ gi@@ me , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N about the President &apos;s proposals for the dr@@ astic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller did not pick up the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and liberty @-@ im@@ it@@ ators would have ag@@ itated him if he had done it .
but he took on their importance , and in particular the meaning attributed to her when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , sevent@@ een years after the completion of the monument , was added to his base .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta compla@@ ined , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go down to a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem you refer to , added later , and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is fac@@ tu@@ ally correct , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary resonance of the stirring words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , your oppressed masses who lon@@ ged for free breathing , the w@@ ret@@ ched waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; w@@ aking waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our screens was better to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller did not commit himself to literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Tr@@ ump USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is in fact a conflict about the meaning of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place her words after her death at the base - knew very well that she took up a highly political act .
the sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a traditional pic@@ torial representation .
Lazarus has changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American n@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus had changed the meaning of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time .
the great cry of R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anybody , but rather an early neo @-@ conserv@@ atism that brings the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty progres@@ sing .
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch shall not enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here .
the meaning of the statue is quite a question of the point of view of perception .
the great f@@ anci@@ ful act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , mis@@ erable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often horrible voy@@ ages on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
and of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to recognize .
their torch shall not light the way , but ign@@ ite the hatred which is their only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Scot@@ s@@ men belonged to the team of Great Britain
the performance director of the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics track , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish ath@@ lets was selected for London 2017 , starting on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something special developed in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the UK must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish ath@@ lets think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type at the corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish ath@@ lete are med@@ als con@@ ten@@ ders , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected team captain by the team .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and genuine feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought in naturally were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hur@@ dle , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Scot@@ s@@ men are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best overall number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the middle @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir leads this way and has set up five British and two European records last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man to watch after a great season , which included the victory of the British team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world championships when the only other Scot@@ s@@ man in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell was .
the team captain says that they are &quot; hu@@ gely proud &quot; to the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also join med@@ als and fin@@ als .
&quot; the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ers voted for me and chose me to make it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes , who want to climb to po@@ di@@ ums .
what concerns my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will be just such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blocking Cri@@ tics on Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating up of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him for everything , from domestic politics to political principles .
he le@@ aped in criticism , confident .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because in the year 17@@ 83 Washington said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and silent we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that brings me to Mary@@ land , Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work on being more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and therefore the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union su@@ ed him at the beginning of this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter reaction with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it &apos;s a guy like Ho@@ gan .
this is a Republi@@ can Gover@@ nor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful in using Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and play his ha@@ iry head for chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of persons coming to the site of the Gover@@ nor - which is a public forum that is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan &apos;s spokesperson Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who swing the whi@@ p online .
the post talked to some of the real people that were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are only true people who speak to their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no troll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful , and not prof@@ ane .
the priest rec@@ ited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans &apos;s Catholic faith .
attorney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; I pol@@ itely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary section &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I also don &apos;t appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same topic , then they are ignored by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the staff of the governor referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam assault &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call others &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest and silence demonstr@@ ators .
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digitally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is accused of Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this issue was last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County last viol@@ ated the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when she banned a vot@@ er from her Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U for his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers was multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letter writers entered into his leadership .
and even then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all the letters of newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions , who critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping with Great Britain , over@@ came his office , according to the historical documents collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project .
but he did not silence her .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means accepting this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
the former European # 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year left in Arch@@ er@@ field Links to the final round , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry made a great job when he laid down that place .
he is a ze@@ al@@ ous advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he has won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that really feels special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open because it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos; a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50@@ th birthday this year , returns to the action on home soil .
this event will be the first Scottish show ever since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel that extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad how it went so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer by smoking passi@@ vely
in the past two decades fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer .
at this end , scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) are in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer deaths are attributed to passive smoke per year , &quot; said Hei@@ ko Becher .
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on the subject of 1994 .
at that time there have been more than 400 lung cancer deaths per year in Germany because of passive smoking .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
home connections prove to be very complex
the construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; are somewhat in time , &quot; said the director of the construction station Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the house @-@ connections , the situation is more complicated than assumed , as in the underground much se@@ amounts , which is not noticeable in the plans .
traffic , which ham@@ pers construction work , is a major problem for the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of mot@@ orists in front of red lights and barriers is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the buses are allowed to drive through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but luckily we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty and death in the Indonesian gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cook the dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Reg@@ ent in the turbul@@ ent Indonesian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace .
after half an hour the char@@ ted tu@@ ber is removed and swal@@ lowed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay ground - she does not have any furniture - where she also performs her daily work , such as washing clothes with op@@ aque water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a homeless room serves as lat@@ rine .
the youngest of the four wives of her husband were not assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , late to work can be dangerous : most villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are soldiers here .
&quot; no one dar@@ es to run around after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occup@@ ying forces by a public uprising .
an existing movement , which stir@@ red for independence from Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta that enter@@ tains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea that encomp@@ assed the eastern part of the island .
the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the rental car .
there is no public transport .
the city , with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants , consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and made of corrugated sheets , which were converted by rust into various yel@@ low@@ ish brown tones .
only very few In@@ don@@ esi@@ ans made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ jan worshipped a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we weren &apos;t used to wearing these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her vibrant , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past we had only sheets on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and have some of the worst inf@@ ant and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , lies only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3.000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has min@@ ed worth 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper .
in addition , wood resources worth estimated US $ 78 billion .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Papua which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military preserves a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 almost $ 20 million , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ lian demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten this golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 people have been killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped , tor@@ tured and incar@@ cer@@ ated by the Indonesian military since 1969 .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal land in the 1970 &quot; s were committed to genocide in accordance with the Asian Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , Indonesian police arrested over 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Are W@@ inning Every@@ thing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is said in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week incidents occur , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have increased , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources provide an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is at 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing as Muslim economic mig@@ r@@ ents come from the populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ts cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served .
local people fight to keep up with them .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chi@@ ckens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua , &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai immig@@ rant who went to work in the province capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cost the native Papua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Papua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indonesian President , Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Papua during his election campaign in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but little has changed in Papua , and today locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ i &apos;s inauguration in October .
on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn on their lights .
one of the soldiers attacked her tone and later returned with four soldiers , the local Pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , ch@@ ased and beat the group with their rif@@ le pist@@ ons , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
one child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so severely beaten that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young women , women and children gathered on a football pitch in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center to demand justice .
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting bows and performed the Wa@@ ita dance - im@@ itating in a circle and im@@ itating a bird song - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ Stamm .
some demonstr@@ ators began to shoot stones at police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , a command was sent to the soldiers on an internal radio : &quot; if the masses have resist@@ ed more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it is said in an official TI@@ ME document that was not released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the im@@ pending danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his brigh@@ tly painted wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came out of the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he added .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and tried his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ oh@@ ex@@ anes said , who like many In@@ don@@ esi@@ ans bears a name , the TI@@ ME in a glo@@ omy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Papua New Police &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said that his officers wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their station because they were attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua @-@ Police , In@@ spec@@ tor Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings first arrived on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historic gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security Minister Wi@@ ran@@ to said in October 2016 that he will set up an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historic human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries have occurred long ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and early 2000 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we are committed to addressing these violations , but there are processes that must be passed through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke with TI@@ ME on June 5 in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ ran@@ to , accused the UN for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence referendum in 1999 , said that 11 cases of violations of human rights were already buried in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims responded to such alleg@@ ations with gri@@ m un@@ belief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us reiter@@ ated that Pan@@ i@@ ai people are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military searched for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings did not cease .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police fired villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a conscientious man to hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
the police said the villa@@ gers were throwing stones into officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began shooting on the crowd and killing one .
&quot; we were in panic , we are afraid that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , such as the TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called on the officers to be held ac@@ coun@@ table and withdraw the police bri@@ g@@ ade from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an in@@ fam@@ y for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the tribal family Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua .
many joined the &quot; Free Papua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papua by spur@@ ring spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have been arrested and arbitr@@ arily arrested , under the pre@@ text of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty rein@@ forces dis@@ satisfaction .
the bit of rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially Not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potato .
they retain the bulk of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
in the course of time economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Papua and the new migrants , which have arrived at Nab@@ ire Airport in greater numbers since the opening of new routes .
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Papua people rarely have capital or the necessary skills to compete with their own businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the tribal council of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
insulation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although the rare permit was given to them for filming .
according to P@@ hel@@ in K@@ ine , the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s election campaign were not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ troubled East@@ ern@@ most provinces of Papua and West@@ pap@@ a : visa refusal and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six Pacific nations - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically backed the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the human right ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4th , locals broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua states that they are unlikely to vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the tribal council .
he wants Jok@@ ow@@ i know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is in poor education and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua ones , consider their voice to Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the threats and in@@ timi@@ dations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai sh@@ ot@@ gun made a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of a victim was buried in an area exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they know that perhaps they will never come to justice , but at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a lowered head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire gras@@ ps the Tor@@ ch sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the world &apos;s highest residential towers in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 @-@ meter high 79 @-@ story building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps through the sky@@ scra@@ per in just two years , which you accidentally call the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch@@ el tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word on the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and when the people shou@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; an inhabit@@ ant told his name as George An@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Dub@@ ais civil protection authorities said the fire fighting units broke the fire at 4.@@ 00 P.@@ M. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) and cooled the building .
the government said it is working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can rein@@ vigor@@ ate questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of sky@@ scra@@ pers around the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 sur@@ rendered that most of the damage occurred from facing , exterior cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation .
in Great Britain the police said that the system of plates for isolation and cl@@ adding on the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup Reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) has passed through his big Davis Cup cou@@ p at the Annual General Meeting .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup only was not supported by the required two @-@ third majority .
although often very long , but also highly valued five @-@ set classic , the traditional competition is preserved .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of member countries voted for the reform , the target of IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore scar@@ cely missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations did not accept the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to safeguard the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will continue to work on improving the application .
not until the vote , the proposal had already come to the conclusion that the final was to be carried out in a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only comparatively minor details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will in future will have the host right in the following year in the following round .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements in training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete fewer official media appointments before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 U.S. travelers bring prohibited items to the aircraft , find a survey
a survey among passengers showed that more than 20 per cent consciously or un@@ consciously prohibited items were smu@@ g@@ gled by the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent of the aircraft , while they accidentally wore forbidden knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they were late discovered that they were accidentally traveling with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey carried out with more than 1,000 people - driven by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers would rather dis@@ regard the rules .
of the respon@@ dents who admitted that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent were millenni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , who were members of Generation X .
the most common items allegedly passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent admitted being know@@ ingly carrying items with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es also confirmed that they had deliberately brought forbidden drugs to the aircraft .
the company said it asked travelers across the country to find out how many in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently smu@@ g@@ gled goods by airport security and how many had intentionally done it .
it is no surprise that the people who were most likely smu@@ g@@ gled goods - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - wear safety , those were the most frequent flying .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure what liquids they can take with you or how much of it .
it is therefore no surprise that the largest quantity of objects conf@@ is@@ cated by the T@@ SA are forbidden fluids .
for a while people thought that T@@ SA could see books as smu@@ g@@ gled goods .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel Order
electro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k enjoys with the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la Model 3 .
so far he has under@@ estimated that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the ever triumph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k revealed a different , less gl@@ amor@@ ous figure on the announcement of the latest quarterly balance : that of the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k has often had more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery just starts .
Mus@@ k now ad@@ mits : of the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 6@@ 3.000 have already been withdrawn .
critics repeatedly pointed out that it was merely non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reser@@ vation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the moment 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations are available , organized Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of so far about twelve percent of all orders could be a problem .
his argument : the challenge with the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 , all models will be taken together - 500@@ ,000 will be one million by 2020 .
the demand for this is obviously there .
according to Mus@@ k , 1,@@ 800 reservations are currently being made per day .
those who order a Model 3 today can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new production lines never tested in practice without major interrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
if there are any major delays , then the liability of reservations may become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent un@@ happy customers from running away in dro@@ ves .
EPA @-@ chief P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw@@ s on account of dela@@ ying the rules of Obama @-@ Er@@ a to reduce emissions
one day after having been su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the head of the environmental protection authority , took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era &apos;s rules to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes as his agency turned out to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint that had been filed against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
a deadline exp@@ ires on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for o@@ zone gas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ de announced in June that he will delay the observ@@ ance by one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interfere with local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump , At@@ tor@@ ney General of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , was a reliable opponent of strict environmental protection regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ de has repeatedly gone over to block or delay regulation which resist@@ s the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ itts regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ de proposed that his turn@@ around in o@@ zone standards would simply reinforce the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , EPA often failed to comply with deadlines for conducting and then waiting to be indic@@ ted by activists and others , and in an agreement to set up the date for the implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who su@@ ed the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation through judicial procedures , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that gives us serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA said that at some point , P@@ ru@@ de will use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on a sound policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive re@@ version of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved in the last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the Senate has not yet been set up in the Senate .
the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of States who su@@ ed EPA this week , said the Group intends to maintain the legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversion of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important asset to health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York joined California , Connec@@ ti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , O@@ reg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone occurs when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight .
the emerging smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year to thousands of premature deaths .
representatives of the public health care system and the environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered on P@@ ru@@ era &apos;s surprising change of course .
&quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to maintain this reasonable step by the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe , &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d of the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological Crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to address environmental contam@@ in@@ ants and their special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 Years of St. Hil@@ ary Church
750 Years of St. Hil@@ ary Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a seren@@ ade on Sunday , 16 July at 4 : 30 p.m .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Ben@@ e@@ ficent Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and promot@@ ers Tum@@ lin@@ gens a concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in a document in the Wu@@ ert@@ tem@@ berg script : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the Berg with the parish church of Tum@@ lingen together with the ab@@ bey &quot; to Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the document , on the hill of Tum@@ linger beside the former parish church there was also a beautiful courtyard , which belonged to the church or the right of pat@@ ron@@ age and not vice versa .
so there were people there too .
as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , it was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still to be seen today in the village image of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; the third , the man@@ orial settlement of the village .
old maps dating back to 1600 confirm this historical situation .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from early medieval church law .
a gentle@@ man who built a church , equipped and occupied with a priest , remained the owner of this church and could also bequ@@ e@@ ath to this church .
in this way , the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two sh@@ attered at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell sounded for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over later during the Second World War in 1942 .
during the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 @-@ 16@@ 48 ) , the window pan@@ es were engraved and the bell pieces were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aking .
in 17@@ 96 French troops were en@@ camp@@ ed near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used it as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church were threatened in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the church of Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demol@@ ished .
only the bell tower was left .
in the New Year &apos;s Night in 18@@ 34 a storm broke the church tower and half collap@@ sed .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demol@@ ished .
only the tower still existing today was preserved as a witness to the 750 @-@ year @-@ old history of the church .
today Horst K@@ all@@ enberg and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em are cultiv@@ ating the Hil@@ arius plant from the &quot; sheep pen@@ sion@@ ers &quot; as the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
as a promot@@ er , the friends and promot@@ ers invited Tum@@ lin@@ gens to the old grav@@ ey@@ ard to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle on Sunday , July 16th , to the sixth seren@@ ade .
it is designed by the com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with speeches by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
the subur@@ b of Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 4 : 30 p.m .
admission is from 3 : 30 pm .
at the end of the seren@@ ade , there is a trunk in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the organizers present fantastic views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade only takes place in dry weather .
the organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of importance for Tum@@ lingen and Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
the friends and promot@@ ers Tum@@ bl@@ gens are particularly committed to their home care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ ms .
association wants to test permission of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim rebels &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not a legal pre@@ condition for the construction and therefore has turned to the Coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; association has called on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land Council Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take back its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette , as at the time in Vier@@ sen there existed only at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal a wind power concentration zone existed .
within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy for the rest of the city .
such zones are intended to prevent &quot; as@@ par@@ ag@@ ment &quot; of the landscape .
the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ets a few days before , but the district government of Düsseldorf did not appro@@ ve , because of a fault .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the granted approval decision is still un@@ lawful and therefore also to take back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , president of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break , the city council once again approved the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded as planned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the relevant letters have been received by the circle Vier@@ sen for last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle makes it the occasion to re @-@ examine the matter .
however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday didn &apos;t want to express itself on the argument of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning to build four each 200 meters high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
in the past year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen is indirectly involved , closed P@@ acht@@ tre@@ aties with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the power requirement of around 11 400 households is to be met - this corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ leg@@ ged households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sen &apos;s City Council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen and a stake in a wind turbine plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor crash together : woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was wounded fat@@ ally .
two more persons were slightly injured .
the state road was closed for hours .
after police data , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch accompanied her car in the course of the accompanying driving with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as a companion the L 3@@ 33 towards Bo@@ gel .
city and tra@@ der plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
in September , Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region will re@@ discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre .
the commercial association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8th and 9th to l@@ ure the residents to the shopping spre@@ e into the city centre .
as the Chairman of the Trade Association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; Hom@@ eland Sh@@ oppen &quot; weekend aims to sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers to what offers their own city ex@@ erts apart from the usual supermarkets .
according to this , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , domestic companies are to present themselves with their training places .
in addition , the shops of the city centre will invite you to the &quot; midnight shopping . &quot;
the campaign aims not only to residents of the city and the region .
in preparation there are commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point out to the action weekend , so Christian König .
city administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
thus the commercial association and the city go into another stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive city centre . &quot;
this includes new offerings such as the first &quot; Active Day &quot; to the well @-@ established Sunday , talks with all trades and hosts to make them active .
attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentials should be re @-@ developed or re @-@ opened .
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many local people would have lost sight of downtown shopping .
in the end , everyone would have to contribute to in@@ vigor@@ ating the city centre - to land@@ lords , the companies of the whole city and associations .
it was necessary to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that partly wi@@ dened , king had said in the spring .
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , director of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities are taking part in the country &apos;s third &quot; home shopping &quot; day .
besides Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , these are Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote appreciation of local trade and raise its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action headed by the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with his buying behaviour can influence his direct surroundings .

a first missing was later also found dead .
the dead were employees of the school .
as a cause of mis@@ fortun@@ es , the authorities presum@@ ed to work on a gas pipeline .
only a few people stayed at the Minn@@ eh@@ aha Academy building during the holiday period .
pumping made after le@@ aked tran@@ scripts of phone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the boundary wall
tran@@ scripts of phone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump asked En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned border wall in a telephone conversation with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US president compla@@ ined because he publicly den@@ ounced the Wall . according to him , he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the US , and v@@ owed to let Mexico pay for the project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tran@@ scripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull said that trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia would be &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was conveyed by the Obama administration would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the United States .
Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after Mr Turn@@ bull said , &quot; This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mo@@ ore Ford massacre &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activists perform rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice &quot; &quot; &quot;
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of viewers in Mon@@ roe ( Georgia ) , and rum@@ oured to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men emerged with rif@@ les to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer procession - took a long train at his ci@@ gar and looked down through the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors , the in@@ mates suspended in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ aming tore the silence when a young black man was torn from the passenger &apos;s seat .
fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , is only a reproduction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown , almost all the audience sounded very real si@@ ghs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , civil rights activists have come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were rep@@ lic@@ ated by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one ever was charged with murder .
&quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years there was not one single person arrested - although we see them in our congregations , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps with the organization of post@@ ures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man of the State of Georgia and a life of long civil rights activists .
for him it serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that injustice was never corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court physician places a sheet on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ching on July 27 , 1946 .
according to F@@ BI files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but none was ever charged .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the loose for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the black people in Georgia to vote for their vote for the first time in the summer .
approximately at the same time as the election st@@ ach according to the F@@ BI of the black Far@@ mer Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our was in the city that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore was not her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land owner , paid $ 600 to free Mal@@ com from prison , the F@@ BI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
but when they approached from the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , concludes with an F@@ BI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy involving government and local criminal prosecution not only involved in kill@@ ings , removing evidence and conce@@ aling the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks even formul@@ ates it more conc@@ isely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an electoral law massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you let yourself be registered and if you vote , this will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene conducted the annual production of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is vivid , po@@ ign@@ ant and is founded in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , many of whom would like to believe that he no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and even harder to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that it &apos;s the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ x because we are confronted with ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve gone through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest bl@@ acks - came into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a gre@@ ener co @-@ director here .
he has played the role of Chief C@@ lan@@ der for years , but he said the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive , because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room the actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ nov , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the high priest scre@@ ams and har@@ dens him , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he , disappear from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Raz@@ oli reci@@ proc@@ ates the fire .
there is a break .
and then everybody breaks out ( at least all black actors ) .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ch@@ ick . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think that white people at that time &apos; n --- he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black actors wit@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you only have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s exactly where the energy shifts in space , a sense of compan@@ i@@ onship replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time , when As@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharp and with im@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman , dressed with a bunch of sad@@ ness , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays trau@@ mati@@ sing pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen viewers wi@@ pes sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided almost evenly between black and white .
a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down just down the street .
they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as pressing moisture for almost eight hours when Broo@@ ks takes her on a pilgrimage to the grave of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the kill@@ ings have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , if you stand in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch kill@@ ings took place , the air feels gh@@ ost@@ ly .
when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body &apos;s body .
children sit on their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they &apos;re not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little boy m@@ um@@ bles as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch@@ rope and wipe off their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w embra@@ ces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit that the clan member has played .
Nick Ras@@ cona embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the women escap@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done this for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience joined the actors for dinner .
at a table a white pair from Atlanta ch@@ ats about the after@@ market with a black couple that they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was fighting to find words which felt the performance left behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the ly@@ n@@ ching is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks is holding court at his table , he eats and recalls the civil rights .
he said he had already begun planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post@@ ures are in a way inspiring because it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is like we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history is condemned to repeat it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dä@@ mm@@ erung &quot; reconc@@ iled the V@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ reuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf is setting up a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous st@@ aging in front of a gigantic six @-@ story backdrop .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) optionally shows a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with the Berlin Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ gue and E@@ la@@ ste &quot; logo from the GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car park in which the Rhein@@ gold@@ alists pose as rock energies , or alternatively an Is@@ etta .
stack@@ ed oil barrels are reminiscent of Cast@@ or@@ fs &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power and greed - which pul@@ ls itself through its &quot; ring &quot; st@@ aging .
the three Rhein@@ gold daughters - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ eel , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize beautifully like in Rhein@@ gold .
K@@ ESS will se@@ duce her to Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , d@@ ash a cor@@ p@@ se into the trunk in Hollywood @-@ style and enter the Kra@@ wall@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen Mill@@ ing sings the wonderfully fu@@ cking Ha@@ gen that surrounds the aura of a heavy weight box .
brutal the scene , when Siegfried pit@@ ched .
later I have to believe Gun@@ ther ( Markus O@@ ak ) .
the audience thanks the ensemble with powerful applause .
Fo@@ ster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are ha@@ iled stor@@ my , who hum@@ bly bows his hands to the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te .
there is a big applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - given the great heat again in casual leisure clothes .
the performance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his team was eag@@ erly awa@@ ited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , he had to let go of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; g@@ lowing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pipe conc@@ erto , and there was a great jubil@@ ation five years later , in which the scattered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bu@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls were going down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is pleased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the d@@ pa performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but also an understanding of its viewpoint .
I draw a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
Max works as a volunteer
they work in their volunteer year in several places .
where everywhere ?
quantity : normally in the furniture market in St@@ einf@@ urt , once a week I will help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I worked at school already in the open full day .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ called volunteer .
how does that come about ?
lot : I did a high school diploma .
and then a civil engineer , let &apos;s say , successful abor@@ ted .
I know for myself that it &apos;s the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else , work with people .
and then I asked myself what do you do .
do a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is , in the focal point , perhaps , really .
and was it so ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester .
I &apos;m going to study dual , probably do a social worker training in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and studying at Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
isn &apos;t it unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends where you do your FS@@ J .
it is possible to do it from the old people &apos;s home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works out .
in other words than in civil engineering ?
quantity : sure , here it &apos;s not about calculating st@@ atics .
again and again there are other people who have a whole different story behind them .
whether a refugee , whether a young person who has been taken out of the family - you always have to go into it individually .
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have reservations ?
quantity : for this I am not the type .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , lots of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s how life is .
Pear@@ son cuts further 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revi@@ ve the business
British Education Group Pear@@ son said on Friday that it will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure faced by the company .
the job cuts , which General Director John Fall@@ on announced mainly for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 , will in addition result in its previous restructuring , where 4,000 jobs have already been lost .
in May , Pear@@ son announced plans to cut costs by a further 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in May to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning .
the company , which last month sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged , after achieving an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kab@@ ul con@@ vo@@ y : NATO soldiers killed in suicide attack
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ vo@@ y in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a soldier of NATO and injured several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , declared a statement by NATO .
according to local reports , three civilians died during the incident in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district .
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in a statement by NATO , it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening was done when a common pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; carried by people &quot; impro@@ vised explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and treated in the US military hospital on the B@@ agra@@ m air@@ field . &quot; &quot; &quot;
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Tali@@ ban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agra@@ m .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July , suicide bom@@ bers killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Tali@@ ban said they had done this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bom@@ b@@ ings in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack in the country since the US @-@ led troops pushed the Tali@@ ban out of power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks , Kab@@ ul &apos;s suicide attacks have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , its policies and , in particular , the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA revers@@ es decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to complaints
the U.S. environmental protection authority has made a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration , repe@@ aled that States are obliged to contain the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place a day after 15 states su@@ ed the agency because of the stri@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oz@@ on@@ provisions 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said it will show the agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and from responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June , P@@ ru@@ de announced the intention of EPA to determine the o@@ zone provisions - in which in a part of the country pollut@@ ant emissions are to be measured , where inc@@ isions must be made to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a wide range of environmental charges imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda , which according to Tr@@ ump should stimulate economic growth .
however , efforts have triggered the set@@ backs of the democr@@ ats and conserv@@ ation@@ ists who are worried about the impact of greater emissions on public health .
the EPA &apos;s website states that inhal@@ ing air , which contains o@@ zone , can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms , such as asthma .
common room wants common room
in the end , the decision was clear : in two opposing voices the Municip@@ ality of Map@@ u@@ ń decides to set up a common room in the future retirement home .
before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing piece of land is signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it will still take place until the area belonging to the church community has so far been in the community , there is no planning obstacle for the project stem@@ ming from a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common room .
one of the two investors , who are still in the boat , offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a surface of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council are preten@@ ding that such a common room should not be regarded as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ous living , but openly into the congregation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget has already been decided in the past fall , by funding opportunities .
the building is located in the renovation area .
the establishment of a common room would be , as reported , T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent .
the proposal is to signal the investor that he does not want to throw a bil@@ let between the legs in this respect , stating that both the saddle - what is le@@ aning against the surrounding construction - as well as the tr@@ ump @-@ roof - which reduces the tr@@ ump @-@ height and makes the construction more economical .
need@@ less to say , Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer does not mean this addition .
when it helps : it passes unanim@@ ously to the body .
it &apos;s not that easy in the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call points to the many of her own buildings , with which one does not move so well , for that they lean into the common room out of the window , she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am hard with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger speaks for the common room - but absolutely against communal participation .
it sees behind it a hidden subsi@@ dy of already wealthy or even foreign investors .
that is not the case , because with the purchase of the surface one does not grant a subsi@@ dy , but gets a real , in case of doubt negoti@@ able counter @-@ value , is the counter @-@ speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ers &apos; proposal to split up the resolution accordingly finds three pro@@ pon@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the case with two counter@@ parts in the original program , which sums up Stefan H@@ aller : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we grasp the decision , we make a giant leap to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with Auto : Rad@@ ler is hur@@ led on road
while crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist on Wednesday in Gar@@ eth was captured by a car and severely injured .
like the police , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder had been on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg from the direction of Hil@@ den .
the senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driving in the same direction was given priority to him .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder drove to the road , he obviously did not pay attention to the contrary .
he came together with a car that led a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown on the road .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ ching vehicle .
FC Bayern Munich must ren@@ ounce the Super Cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
with personnel care , the FC Bayern moves to Dortmund for the first mandatory match of the new season .
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup versus Cup winner .
in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 a.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , staff members of the German football record champion Bayern München are getting bigger and bigger at the cup winner Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must also do without David Al@@ aba in Du@@ el with the BV@@ B .
this was confirmed by the Italian on Friday .
also included are Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six tests , An@@ cel@@ otti has been responsible for the physical condition and the missing balance in his team &apos;s play .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the team &apos;s balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , it was not good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 58 @-@ year @-@ old , however , believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory match of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to be intelligent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German soccer heav@@ y@@ weights captiv@@ ates the fans .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 viewers , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday .
in the resin from star to star
&quot; &quot; &quot; the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be built in the Harz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is planned by the association Stern@@ warte Sankt Andreas ( St. Andre@@ as@@ berg ) .
a Plan@@ etary Trail exists in Göttingen , Germany since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; met the need for information from many visitors of the town . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase by 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
question : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber .
the information on the boards should be updated via the Internet .
for this reason , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of the location .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later the train will be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star path , the viewers experience a lot of worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , they learned why stars could have different colors or why a star is more lumin@@ ous than another , although it is considerably far@@ ther away .
it is also conveyed in which con@@ stellation is a selected star and when it is best to see .
the association has been running the highest situated observ@@ atory in northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
since 2003 , on the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Göttingen , there is something similar to the Plan@@ etary Trail on the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Göttingen .
starting in front of Geb@@ hart &apos;s Hotel at the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet path with its stel@@ ae goes up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( community of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf Planet - are located at the end point exactly in distance and scale from one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the Sun , exactly 75 meters away , measures 70 centimet@@ res .
the entire distance of the planet route is about four kilometres .
while the light from the sun to the Plu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
therefore , pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in space .
the march to the next fix star would take half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ak@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ak@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course in order to stage the most exciting boxing fight in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles to Gar@@ cia , who went down@@ stairs to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organisation Super @-@ fe@@ ather @-@ weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous vote on the former four @-@ divisions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday in Show@@ time both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia put out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko is defending his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noticed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect order of magnitude &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I climbed up to £ 140 for Bron@@ er , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to come down to lightweight .
and he has to move to light weights &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that is what the fans demand .
let us give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this struggle . &quot;
climate scientists asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ak@@ enko must fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year to reconci@@ le with Gar@@ cia in the next summer ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also interest in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their light @-@ weight fight in the forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode because all fans asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said and later openly expressed himself on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he appreci@@ ates Lom@@ ak@@ enko as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday battle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ak@@ enko held his generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thought the three @-@ battle champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looked very slowly , &quot; I &apos;m sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the ko @-@ off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show stroke strength , then boxes .
both said they could feel the momentum created for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the struggle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been waiting for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injured after tire bur@@ sts
in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were seriously injured in the afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control of his vehicle shortly before the connection point of the market width at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
the car stopped right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ threw himself and then stayed on the roof in the green strip .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was locked in the direction north for approximately one hour , then the traffic on the left lane could be led past the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; three @-@ chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hoping for 2 : 2 at the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , that optim@@ ising the defense formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first race of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the result as well , wouldn &apos;t have been the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Br@@ uns@@ wick .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to look better in au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defense player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the three @-@ chain chain is also to be further optimised .
and the For@@ tun@@ en doesn &apos;t want to capture a gate after a kick .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , it will be that nobody will stand alongside Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the experience in preparation with the three chain than with the four chain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; still I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , &quot; because we have just in the three @-@ chain at the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a prerequisite is , however , that we harmon@@ ize even better and we do not make so many playing mistakes in the construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann also goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can speak for a draw from a failed start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we have four points on Sunday and can focus on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a good season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing about it .
&quot; I judge the start of the season only after six to eight days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to speak of an advantage compared to Au@@ e , only because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled pre@@ mat@@ urely because of an accident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might even be somewhat fres@@ her , as they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against an advancement favorite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know exactly where they are at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Fort@@ una interior def@@ enders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although guests from the Rhin@@ eland leave the Rhin@@ eland an easy favourite on Sunday to meet at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we swe@@ ep them away , only because we have the right to get into the first six is stupid , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the second Bundes@@ liga , which you must hit from the start , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as chief coach .
&quot; meeting such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el does not want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of Swedish asylum application tests published
the recent results of testing for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the people tested are older than 18 years , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Authority ( R@@ ät@@ go@@ Medi@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started the tests last year .
during the asylum procedure , they should take a closer look at the assessment of the age after the Swedish Migration Service ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) was critici@@ zed for errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees who were under age .
to date , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 testing cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged to be 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; possibly under 18 years of age &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high percentage of cases in which the person has been assessed for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
in May , the agency announced the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 published results , she noted that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly stated that she would be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , where x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints are made , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a skep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves the assessment of man &apos;s biological maturity to see if they were usually going through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the kind of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
judging the biological age in this way is very uns@@ af@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we can &apos;t say it , we shouldn &apos;t do as though we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of getting a child as an adult is low . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 . in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the Plan
the works on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday , a seven @-@ ton@@ ne concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Head of the Department of Road Traffic and Traffic in the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Freiburg .
in April , the works began simultaneously on all three remedi@@ ation bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the construction site is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule is being met .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is an arch @-@ arch bridge made of concrete , covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red coloured sand@@ stone .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning got a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bridge cap on the north side .
this is a peripheral mount , which is also used as operating mode .
on Friday , a 2.@@ 20 @-@ metre @-@ wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is supposed to proceed .
the special thing about it is that these are finished parts , a patent by the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps .
particular finger @-@ tip feeling has required the laying of lines through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable where many companies are connected .
local residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished at first .
for the bridges between the building yard building and the collecting @-@ house in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , the traffic is governed by a traffic light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is fully closed for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach village entrance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the three bridge types amounts to 700@@ ,000 euros .
the whole is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : colorful protest with German potato salad
it is not so common for parties to pull together , but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to reconci@@ le .
the parties represented in the circle of the volcanic Ei@@ fel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance , which is peaceful in this day because the Af@@ D invites to the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle R@@ ond@@ elle as loud as the poster &quot; great campaign launch . &quot;
and well @-@ known names start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ l forms the top duo for the German Bundestag election on September 24 , and the deputy chair@@ person Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D collectors , but to demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Ei@@ fel is colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally the city picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but is now taking place on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus right in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful picture that offers itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair of the forum One World and one of the leading organizers , is really happy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and a lot of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rustic potato salad &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which also the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police has ordered many police officers to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence mainly at the railway station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ D volcano is reported to have tried to make such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf was initially in demand in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes there were not enough parking spaces available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; well , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ ond@@ elle , Hom@@ pes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a view to the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ forec@@ our@@ platz , he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does : at around 8@@ pm there is a band for entertainment at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ forec@@ our@@ t , in the Stad@@ thalle various speakers , among them the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe Young .
in the hall there are about 200 people waiting for the top candidate for the election of the German Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch holding their speeches .
the police presence remained unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour the Af@@ D event takes place , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there it is announced shortly after 9@@ pm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police can move away - no special incidents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
trumpet meets trumpet
a re@@ union with the tro@@ mb@@ one tro@@ mb@@ one Freder@@ ic B@@ elli in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ konz@@ erte tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the monastery church .
together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets classical German education with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the solo@@ ist at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo@@ ist of the SW@@ R symph@@ ony orchestra .
both combine the desire not only to transc@@ end the borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
this is what Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new gown , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; unites with Bulgarian folklore , and in the play &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz singer N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free play become a fascinating total artwork .
this cent@@ re@@ piece of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about their bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love gri@@ lling cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart over her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite in grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was the &quot; twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who finally dealt bit@@ terly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the brun@@ ette of Dar@@ stell@@ an ass@@ ures the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with everyone I hated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I &apos;ve played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed in du@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so I have never confused or hin@@ dered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I only liked it , not being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she especially suffered from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in school days when she would rather dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven , the kids told me I &apos;d look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public doesn &apos;t like to explain their love life : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you to count yourself in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me than@@ kl@@ ess , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself to the general public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the Party
the Democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of memory ... today I &apos;ll tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the manifestation broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; as a trainer , I would say that it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump had previously announced a big announcement at the West Virginia Rallye .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he has coal mines in five states , and he inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth approximately 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , on Thursday evening , the Republi@@ can National Committee announced a statement in which it said : &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would prevent us from working on it again to make our country a great one again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the final rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without guidance and is unable to find a positive , negative message , &quot; said R@@ NC Chairman Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News .
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
the global leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sports .
Russian athle@@ tics leader D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the World Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships that the exile of his country was correct from sports and that he was determined to fight dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the athletes who have been rob@@ bed of gold and silver med@@ als in competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite its comments , the IA@@ AF congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence of state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer to this day , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the repor@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized by itself that it has experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re@@ use Russia , &quot; Co@@ e said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next few months we have to do everything to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean ath@@ lete from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics World Championships that begin on Friday in London based on strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the leader of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still insufficient and forbidden trainers are still free , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in London after a lecture at IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sack@@ cloth sack@@ ed in Mali
during a funeral service in the North @-@ Hes@@ sian town of Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
defense Minister Ursul@@ a von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing to the still un@@ explained down@@ fall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but she described the two inver@@ ted pilots as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts of their expertise &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow to this highest sacrifice which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ s@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen came to life on Wednesday a week ago in Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a dead guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in St. Peter &apos;s Cathedral on Thursday .
at mid@@ day only the relatives in the church took leave .
after that , the funeral ceremony in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics began .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
dre@@ aded branches placed roses , the relatives stood arm in arm at the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the minister of defense of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Le@@ yen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described the surrounding soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sat@@ ined . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ s@@ aup@@ t@@ mann set up the flight operation of the helicopter tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger drivers of his regi@@ ment .
Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regi@@ ment belonging to the soldiers , said : &quot; if the crew could not turn away the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show Prime Minister of the Le@@ yen : the deployment is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral , the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik doesn &apos;t want a grave beside his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
the house divided the royal house on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the queen was in agreement with her husband &apos;s decision .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret of the fact that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 he retired and also puts the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prince Su@@ pper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik wrote in Denmark not the title and the function he wanted , he would not see himself as equivalent to his wife - not even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish royal house .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years .
born in 1965 in London , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ ble@@ man , was born in London .
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French embassy .
during his later wife &apos;s sympath@@ ies with the people , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 @-@ year rule in the Dan@@ es .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik wrote about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises that I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the call to be the brand of socio @-@ critical intellectu@@ als , I could not hope to look at it .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants a quick re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP on potential majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , after the loss of the red @-@ green Government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the Land@@ tag , does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the parliament &apos;s resolution on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unexpected withdrawal of a Gre@@ ens Euro MP from her Land@@ tag fraction in Lower Saxony collap@@ sed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the Parliament election , the Red @-@ Green coalition in Hannover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
former Green MEP El@@ ke T@@ westen combined their step with non @-@ nom@@ ination for election 2018 in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; group leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his Group to record it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxon State Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats .
until now , the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be voted on 14 January next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether to go@@ vern in this situation without majority .
however , Stephan Wei@@ l considers it indispensable that the country &apos;s day resol@@ ves its self @-@ resolution as quickly as possible .
the CD@@ U is expected to decide on its further course on Tuesday .
the Constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s parliament el@@ ic@@ its confidence and el@@ ects a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these possibilities must be legally validated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will discuss all the questions in peace if they are legally tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ essa &apos;s step &quot; a bit strange . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
she described herself as a pendant of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the ren@@ eg@@ ade members to return to their state parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it goes without saying that they have immediate effect on their country @-@ day trade , which they have received over the green country list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chairman Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen exceptional . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have consciously decided not to show any pron@@ unciation in the group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot comprehend this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the surrender of the Lower Saxon Gre@@ ens Euro MP El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U as betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of former Green Party dep@@ u@@ ties in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of the voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal President of the Socialists and Democrats on Facebook on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to elect the Land@@ tag as soon as possible .
the exit T@@ west@@ ens costs the majority of Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her past vanity and fru@@ stration , the politi@@ cian places her personal interests in front of the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty intri@@ gue game and tries to make political capital from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nieder@@ sach@@ sen CD@@ U @-@ faction leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his MPs to include El@@ ke T@@ westen into the CD@@ U .
the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused T@@ westen to fal@@ si@@ fy the outcome of the 2013 Parliament election with personal career presents .
the CD@@ U was the strongest force in the time before the SPD , but the SPD and the Gre@@ ens in the parliament had a very thin majority of one vote .
interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ f@@ tei@@ s , Herr Schmidt ?
Germany is talking about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the German editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Mr Schmidt , how can the consumer protect himself from pois@@ oned eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to watch the eggs carefully in their fridge and check the stamp pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German federal states provide the latest information on the affected eggs bat@@ ches on the consumer protection portal www.@@ foodstuffs war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if after all we know currently , a health hazard is practically impossible .
now Al@@ di takes the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the re@@ con@@ na@@ iss@@ ance is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately switched off and has since become the acquain@@ tance of Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
just as the manufacturers are concerned about the fact that the products sold are market@@ able and harmless to health .
if the residual value of eggs is 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , these are not capable of handling .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time the factories are not to blame .
do production companies and consumers sit in the same boat ?
according to the state of knowledge , the production companies do not have an immediate fault .
rather , they must reck@@ on with economic damages due to the presum@@ ed illegal practice of service companies .
as always there is too little control in the case of emer@@ gen@@ cies .
is it missing only on the staff or in the conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
it was just the official controls which revealed the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the truth is also that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out at 100 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is precisely for this reason that a consistent explanation of such events and the transfer to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where criminal off@@ ences can be present is of crucial importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made it clear several times that I expect full clari@@ fication from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular alarm mis@@ m really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to only get safe and transpor@@ table food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an un@@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are justified . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pan@@ try means manufacturers , distributors and consumers get into a situation absolutely not necessary .
in principle , it must be clear that the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in keeping food @-@ safe animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately .
at all levels it is necessary to work consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all the competent authorities that the facts become clear and complete .
how the financial rules of football affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered expendi@@ tures of the European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spain to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to ban cre@@ ws from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G must prove that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to extract the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can certainly make the money loose for N@@ ey@@ mar to sign it and bring it into a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy rich ruling family of Qatar .
clubs must spend a lot of money for the purchase of players , but must be subject to legitimate revenue sources , which enable them break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs who had taken huge debts in their quest for success effectively dec@@ eive and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debts of clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model , which Roman Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a harder affair .
during the current 3 @-@ year FF@@ P publishing period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros .
and although Plat@@ ini has failed in 2015 by the Pres@@ i@@ dency , his successor , Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , continues to sc@@ are away from excessive spending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will surely reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , over the Associ@@ ated Press in the past week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PS@@ G has paid the Buy @-@ out clause from N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat fee , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing over the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year agreement , so that the revenue figures for the next five years can be transferred to 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million euros in the financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
PS@@ G received a fine of € 60 million ( at that time $ 82 million ) , which was later lowered to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 player .
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs trying to out@@ wi@@ t their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenue from companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a Catalan company could sponsor PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing was to exceed standard market rates , UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate in@@ comes .
exactly that happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsor of the P@@ SA was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come to Qatar via payments of the 2022 World Cup 2022 World Cup .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have cont@@ ested that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s World Cup ambassador is going to be and such a manoeu@@ vre for UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could be easy to figure out .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be more attentive to any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
UEF@@ A had no pre @-@ prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G via N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , said Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke about the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , because they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has generated a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year must still be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ship deals , merchan@@ dising and tri@@ cot sales .
the Association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after its signature .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best foot@@ ball@@ ers going to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; it &apos;s a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G .
arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American Sport Ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La League against a state financed by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and this has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it becomes very difficult to respect the financial fair@@ play because one can go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new Scho@@ eller supplier
over the past few years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has made @-@ board chocolate for Swiss .
now the sweet cooperation is at the end of a possible end : the airline will re@@ write the order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss @-@ spokesperson Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to current planning , the airline plans to conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products are checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the speaker .
around 17 million small , white @-@ white , white @-@ white chocolate tablets spread over 14 grams a year before landing to the passengers .
the Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs .
industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders according to &quot; Nor@@ th@@ western Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves annual sales of approximately 1 billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a Scho@@ eller manufacturer .
the Swiss company does not want to betra@@ y how many applicants hold the new tender .
but only Swiss manufacturers come into question .
according to the news report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the contract for spring 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not achiev@@ able for an opinion .
since 2006 , the Swiss chocolate panels have been distributing the Swiss chocolate panels on board their flights .
prior to the signing of a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut developed the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
Swiss two and a half years ago , Swiss introduced the opportunity to place the logo together with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline operates with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ haul flights , First Class customers are p@@ am@@ pered with treats from the confection@@ ery Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class passengers scho@@ gg@@ i from Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in Business and Economy Class , distri@@ butes also on the short circuit .

nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &apos;s , for the 90 @-@ years Gr@@ unge era ( as the pione@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show turned the sket@@ ch comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for itself - that is , for 2001 before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ ody and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worked surprisingly well , not just because of its absurd humour ( it contained an original story for talking tin vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by sti@@ cking to the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actor playing cool kids who will grow up - they still managed to gain the im@@ possibility to regain the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his grown @-@ ups , who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ ody extends more to the watering can principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 &apos;s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The Hand that sheds the cra@@ dle &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at one point , a character rum@@ bles through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of other things dating back to 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gra@@ cious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy evil plot , included in the Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it is especially fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s sub@@ li@@ pp@@ ies of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy .
these are the moments of random del@@ usion that could inc@@ ite this fran@@ chise like a sort of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until it reaches that which I consider as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the band how to visit the movie premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
in the meantime , &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon also reminds us of another kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even at &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its East versus West ring fight icon@@ ography .
the comedy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hardened Greg@@ ory and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alo@@ gues by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an executive producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt are synchron@@ ised in English .
it &apos;s a brilliant idea .
but it &apos;s not much more than an idea .
there are some beautiful g@@ ags to look at ( the police sp@@ ends the time to watch chess on television , as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ha Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent play &apos; Find out the voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a re@@ ag@@ an mask - that it often plays like a single .
with six long episodes , it pul@@ ls away , and the comedy is not fast or often enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was reduced to a lower length , could better supply his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , as Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef repeatedly visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a for@@ age for a feast .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romans cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and with theirs .
strike against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police managed to strike a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office announced on Friday .
at the same time , 15 accused were arrested between 25 and 77 years old and arrest warran@@ ts had already been issued against them .
in addition , officials made large quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros .
two people were arrested at the same time in Italy .
against the two susp@@ ects of Italy , there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two are therefore probably extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
a total of more than 300 police officers were deployed .
the Ma@@ fia &apos;s members are accused of organised drug @-@ crime , serious violence , attempted murder , as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating the Con@@ stance against organised drug traffi@@ cking in Southern Germany .
between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , the large @-@ scale deployment was accompanied by four officers from Palermo on Wednesday morning .
the aim of the investigation was mainly Italian citizens with a close relationship with the Italian Ma@@ fia .
an incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , is likely to go to the bank account .
Weise lam@@ ents big gaps in the for@@ eig@@ ner @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not emerge &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the for@@ eig@@ ner register shows considerable short@@ com@@ ings in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious wrong decisions regarding asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ gee Management , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the national register of foreigners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; serious wrong decisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of asylum procedures and deportation , in a warning that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the data register , there are about ten million people with foreign nationality included , including about 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore administered by approximately 600 immigration authorities in Germany .
because the data had not been sufficiently cared for , the data quality in parts has not been good so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by people who have long ceased to live , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data entries can slow down revers@@ al processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the statistics on reasonably paid people , EU citizens are also gr@@ asp@@ ed that would not have to leave .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such false orders , however , led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a distorted debate on how to deal with foreigners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently begun to return refugee families back to Italy under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children if they have entered from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this comes from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the paper , it is said that BA@@ MF will carry out such proceedings concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 it was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper was referring to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement , it is responsible for refugees from the EU state to reach them first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a mig@@ ré is travelling to another EU country , this state can send it back to the country of entry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the office now writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has substantially increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy gave guarantees for the reception and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ rt@@ HR ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other EU states would also send refugees back to it within the framework of the Dublin Agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the domestic spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing fraction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children thre@@ aten un@@ lawful reception conditions and a threat to child welfare due to lack of asylum in the Italian asylum system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood from persons living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach had already provided blood donation service to other people .
at least of the twelve citizens awarded on Friday .
Jürgen Gre@@ ens , who has now donated 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations .
traditionally , in the joint session of the Municipal Council , the congregation acknow@@ le@@ dges the multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is brilliant how our body is designed for it and we pay tribute to the don@@ ors respect , which make their blood available to strangers , still un@@ sel@@ fish@@ ly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ lined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the officer of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the cann@@ ed are broken down into their constitu@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , three persons could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , corn producers reported about the actions carried out in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach in the spring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K county worker coordinator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the change to the theatre house led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago .
previously , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Stra@@ w@@ berry were among the multi @-@ don@@ ate don@@ ors and were awarded for each 50 blood donations each .
half as many book Herbert M@@ air and Dor@@ o@@ thee Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ de@@ mann , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter gave away ten times each 500 milli@@ liters of their life juice .
the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England will likely later announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation about an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it retained the interest rates on family income in the midst of intensified pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s political decision makers ( M@@ PC ) agreed with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates down to 0.@@ 25 % , with less members increasing in this month as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase .
in its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and by 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that pressure on domestic income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the autumn .
but it sign@@ alized that in the next few years interest increases would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation heated by Bre@@ x@@ it and it said that credit costs would have to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw part of the M@@ amm@@ oth economic package , which was published a year ago after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper finance for banks as of the coming February , although it was said that now it is expected to make 15 billion pounds more available within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to the interest rates , she repeated that &quot; a certain tightening of monetary policy &quot; would be required to cool inflation and a &quot; somewhat larger &quot; extent than the markets expected .
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
however , the Bank emphasized that increases would be &quot; gradual &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts outlined below for this year and next year are in line with the 1.9 % and 1.7 % predicted in May .
it maintained its growth forecast at 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision on no amend@@ ment will come after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened rising expectations on interest rate rise and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months has risen to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly after the end of the year .
the latest inflation report had little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by rising inflation and low rise levels , as the tightening will get worse first before it will improve .
she added that in the next few years monetary policy could not &quot; prevent the income tax , &quot; but she added that wages will recover significantly at the end of her three @-@ year forecast .
the economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak Po@@ und , which will offset some of the lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes one year after lowering the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote caused by the fall of the pound .
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years to fully achieve the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s final verdict on interest rates , the call for interest rates rose as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pushed households , with three political decision @-@ makers demanding an increase of 0.5 % in July .
inflation has dropped from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said it was expected and will attract it again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said the exceeding in proportion to its target of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wholly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attributable to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrew Mont@@ lake , director of Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given the recent return of Swa@@ p rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , as the credi@@ tors are looking sil@@ ently for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market is particularly good for those in which the existing deals exp@@ ire and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) urged to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September following a fight in front of the High Court against financing the drug in N@@ HS .
N@@ HS England announced that pre@@ text pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now delivered by the health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court uph@@ eld the Supreme Court ruling that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p in spite of the claim that the local authorities should finance it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England CEO Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive moment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d are among the first to enable the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in the whole of England in April 2018 .
pre@@ text pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV medicine taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in infection areas .
pre@@ p prior to intercourse means that just enough medication in the body of a person are present to prevent an HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who question the treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and people with HIV @-@ positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics , suitable candidates are identified , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program is signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week following an international competitive purchase .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p using clinical evidence collected and implemented on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pre@@ p , if directed specifically to people in need and endangered , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now be to ensure that the study is carried out rapidly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that pre@@ p test medicine has been proc@@ ured , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , shadow health minister , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and delayed implementation by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transformed this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this experiment brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected and that it will contribute to the termination of the spread of HIV in society a step closer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living the Great Life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , moved from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court Apartment in 2014 .
it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; Jo@@ anne says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was looking for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi in Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12.@@ 5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other , so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the task .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper @-@ light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gil@@ ded furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in the addition of theatre , space and light .
at both ends a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to let it work for a longer time .
in the kitchen the mirr@@ oring feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all cutlery and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering art went into it , &quot; explained Er@@ fan from the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important , so that when you push the door , it gli@@ des very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the size of the floor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor surface while using high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that you touch and that will help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not love the electrical outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself into something quite amazing through a good design and increased square footage .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you might decide not to leave this .
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a dispute because of one of the largest real estate markets in Victori@@ as worth more than $ 500 million .
the former director of the Carl@@ ton Football Club and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets should be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 real estate assets worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family purchased a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood in 1973 .
there the West@@ co family founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money was invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the city center , the Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to development areas , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her de@@ ceased father , Col@@ in - by Paul as the &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - has about two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a court file says that Col@@ in owns property worth $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul worth 17@@ 6 million dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him behind what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .
the brothers are now fighting for the control of the existing business - of which Col@@ in , like Paul claims , has excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul of in@@ compet@@ ently managing some of his possessions .
in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it that was filed by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian inheritance writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs increase in the case , with hundreds of pages with affir@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and Law Fir@@ ms held by both sides .
Ms. De Lu@@ tis and her de@@ ceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delic@@ at@@ essen shops from the late 1950s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they took advantage of the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property where Col@@ in opened the first jeans shop of the family .
Col@@ in says he started West@@ co there when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on her property to her sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , although Col@@ in claims that Mark was paid $ 10 million when leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark were , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in held back very much , although he was a former AF@@ L member of the board and after a biography from the year 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , he was the best friend of television stars .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in responded by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case was in front of the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and to pass our family name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end up in our current fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , and added that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our issue will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new Chief of Staff Head@@ quarters plans to limit the President &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Politi@@ co reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including the news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more smooth course . &quot; &quot; &quot;
here is a piece of repor@@ ter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with senior employees on his first day of work , he represented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump White House that he wanted to fix : poor information that was thrown into the hands of the president . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by monitoring his media diet .
President Tr@@ ump &apos;s relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when candidate Tr@@ ump was angry because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs that were too convincing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said former election campaign consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February of Politi@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Politi@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keep tr@@ umps Twitter habit is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady lob@@ b@@ ying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that tr@@ umps Twitter custom was ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps these campaign officers know something we don &apos;t know about others - that Tr@@ umps twe@@ ets would have contained even more combus@@ ti@@ bles without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
if his employees managed to keep him away from him several times , their efforts paid off .
but no one has consistently prevented it from provo@@ king tr@@ ump controversi@@ es .
one part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , are always trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump material that may promote their views from the world .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advis@@ ors to bring du@@ bi@@ ous information to the president for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by Repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ smith :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former plat@@ former officials say that pumping like a volcano can react to negative press releases , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he tries to find out where they originate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly this happened at the end of February when somebody accused the president of a printed copy of an article by Got@@ news@@ .com , the web site of Internet provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was permanently ban@@ ished from Twitter because of har@@ ass@@ ment or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and has rev@@ oked it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and started asking staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ smith added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the General Secretary of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work and document the dump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly is trying three months later to do the same thing .
perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ers still strive for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most wanted criminals receive mail from Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped for .
the police throughout Europe sent postcards to dangerous criminals in this summer ( virtual ) postcards .
as the addresses of the sought @-@ after criminals are naturally not known , references from the population will be hoped for and requested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday about the action following the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent calendar from the winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the experiences have shown that many fle@@ eting spots on holiday destinations are hidden , it was called Euro@@ pol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
21 post cards for sought @-@ after criminals from 21 EU countries have been compiled .
since 2016 the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted has been available , more than 2.5 million times this has been viewed .
36 of the online applications have so far been arrested , at least eleven of them based on information after publication on the website .
travelers negotiate about a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire &apos; series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some determined travellers on the base of the war , who have negotiated a tren@@ ch dra@@ fted by the community to rec@@ la@@ im a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a wealthy road by Soli@@ hull that is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire series &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought along horses , babies and an army of v@@ ans after they were thrown out only in May , but without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council to prevent their attacks .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered in order to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull to say that it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they moved there on Monday evening after they were sent to Bentley He@@ ath where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must indeed be forced by shame to implement it as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are now back .
more arrived last night , probably even more today . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by keeping long instructions to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my com@@ mons if the Council cannot stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a local who didn &apos;t want to be named said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last round of these travellers just to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and cooperate with the police of Soli@@ hull . we take the necessary legal steps to keep them moving as soon as possible .
to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create an image of the situation in which the court must examine when we submit our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof becomes Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof due to the then ambience company gesellschaft mbH on April 13 , 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also income by the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of the dramatic increase in numbers of refugees entering the county , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation for controversial discussions .
the city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a plan to secure the territory as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the Municipal Council .
but especially Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s Mayor , Julian O@@ ss@@ wald , defended the hotel location and spoke of serious interested parties at the house .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els with managing director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you will find Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof , construction sh@@ utt@@ les have been standing in front of the entrance for a longer period of time and when entering the house it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are made .
the floors were torn out , ceilings partly removed , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still a lot to do until March .
&quot; it &apos;s actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is remo@@ del@@ ed , new windows will be installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should later become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beautiful bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities .
one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale inner city level , Sch@@ erer emphasizes .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its 60 rooms , wants to set up wide , explains Sch@@ erer more .
both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people should feel at ease in the hotel .
he has already had discussions with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer .
the noti@@ ons of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
according to the level of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to decide exactly .
just under one million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the external systems are also placed on the front , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which will be accessible from the restaurant that is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : US Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator sets a Grand Jury
in the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special investig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury in a report .
in recent weeks , the panel has taken up the work , wrote the Wall Street Journal on appeal to persons familiar with the matter .
the newspaper saw the move as a sign that Mu@@ eller had expanded and intensified his investigations .
the CN@@ N broad@@ caster reported that there were already first charges of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between the tr@@ umps of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies have long accused the Krem@@ lin from interfer@@ ing in the 2016 presidential election campaign .
Mu@@ eller investig@@ ates whether there were agreements between the Tr@@ ump Elec@@ toral Camp@@ a@@ ign team and Moscow .
the investigation will focus on several men who acted as consultants of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the election campaign .
according to reports Mu@@ eller took a closer look at more and more tr@@ umps of private and business environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special agent Tr@@ ump personally came to the centre and asked whether the president could possibly hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jury is to examine present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to apply a charge .
Grand j@@ uries are therefore also called dock .
most of the time , they are turned on when they are larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be switched on by the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in order to invite people to inter@@ rog@@ ation under oath .
according to CN@@ N , demonstrations have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement , that was said in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r , Tr@@ ump Consult@@ ants and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ us@@ h@@ ner as well as his former presidential rap@@ port@@ eur Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were in the conversation .
legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the implementation shows that Mu@@ eller does not let himself be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that if it should be necessary to act quickly .
however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the charge of an indictment .
however , the establishment of the body is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for ap@@ pre@@ hen@@ sion for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revelations , on Thursday evening , the President uses a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the subject gives the democr@@ ats a way to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor , T@@ y Cob@@ b , stated in a statement that he knew nothing of the sub@@ stitution of a Grand Jury .
but this usually works in secret , he emphas@@ ised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advoc@@ ates any action that accelerated the work of the special agent in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fa@@ ire &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former F@@ BI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that he was not determined against the president . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one has no reason to assume that something has changed , it was stated in the statement .
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this round@@ worm , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump had become lou@@ der , he wanted to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Com@@ ey said in June of a sen@@ ate committee , P@@ ump asked him to set up investigations against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
following representation of US media , the White House gathered material against the Special Issu@@ er and its employees .
this triggered speculation about whether a plat@@ former would release Mu@@ eller .
unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair surrounding the later retired president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired at the beh@@ est of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of repub@@ li@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators presented bill of draft on Thursday , after which the Special Issu@@ er could not be dismissed as easily .
Antar@@ ctic : giant ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Antar@@ cti@@ ca
in the western Antar@@ ctic a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg of the scar@@ cely se@@ ven@@ fold size of Berlin solved itself from the ice shelf .
this was announced by the Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the col@@ os@@ sus of more than one tri@@ l@@ lion and 5@@ 800 square kilometres is now driving to the north and will probably need two or three years until it melted .
with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest iron gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades .
it is not a danger to people .
the extent to which climate change has played a role in the rup@@ ture of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear according to research data .
in total , however , there has been a series of unusual break@@ downs of ice @-@ el@@ ites in the region for about 30 years , writes the US research centre for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fact background .
according to many researchers , global warming can be related .
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus was so far a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C ice shelf .
Sch@@ el@@ ho@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
it therefore grows further into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ s is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
to the north of this ice shelf the balance of wa@@ xes and break@@ downs was disturbed several years ago .
a complete hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e is broken down there , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C ice shelf is in danger , because the front edge has never been pulled back as far as currently .
in addition , the iron plate stands under tension and can decay if a piece breaks down at a key point .
the melting of ice shelf and ic@@ e@@ berg does not increase sea level , as they float on the water and ice so much water as it results after melting .
however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only to a small extent , the British research project insi@@ sts on the observation of Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C ice shelf is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antar@@ cti@@ ca with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters .
there it breaks down regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural happening and is aware of no direct connection to climate change , the ice shield now comes to a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the broad@@ est retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ s would grow back or fall back in the long term and possibly collap@@ sed , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
although these scientists do not trace the rup@@ ture of this giant ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , many glaci@@ ers of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades .
this long hem of the Antar@@ ctic stretches towards South America .
according to data from the research programme British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the increase in temperature contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med up around three degrees in the past 50 years and therefore counts to the areas where the temperature rises the fastest .
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f for staff
because it is becoming more and more difficult to fill vac@@ ant places , the CD@@ U asks to step out of the employer &apos;s association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , the circle day for@@ ked 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1,@@ 100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have finished their first working day .
the teachers in the circle are obviously very sought @-@ after .
some 6@@ 20 applications were recorded for the places to be awarded this year .
nevertheless , the circle continues to lack staff in order to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
currently there are 50 non @-@ occupied places in the M@@ ett@@ mann district .
among other things , doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration , are sought .
in the circle @-@ stag , the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the administration should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is not only to meet short @-@ term requirements for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented candidate shortage .
the overall concept should be oriented both internally and externally , showing concrete measures for cross @-@ entran@@ ts and include a training offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other towns adverti@@ se good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is from a real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , a high number of employees leave the service due to illness or age due to age .
the highest time to act so that not even more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party .
he un@@ expect@@ edly took care of a fist @-@ thick surprise when he publicly challenged staff@@ ing costs and start@@ led the rest of the parties .
people want all possibilities to be checked , which allow a withdrawal from the communal employer association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we don &apos;t come to a satisfying solution in the short term , the county administration should aim with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a ho@@ of tari@@ ff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pe@@ op@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the CD@@ U tries to pay better the employees and officials when it actually sees the tari@@ ff for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are at present exactly prescribed , increases or more money is available only if you change to a higher level which is oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the Circle have grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Act .
not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , the Coun@@ cill@@ or Thomas Hen@@ del@@ e and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy tigh@@ tens the tone of NGO @-@ migrants &apos; lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they must not continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis War@@ ning came one day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat from the German aid organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their team effectively collabor@@ ated with traffi@@ ckers in a way facilit@@ ating illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to express detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian citizen Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the salvation of human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only assess all accus@@ ations currently being raised after we have gathered all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is thought that its crew carries din@@ gh@@ y din@@ gh@@ y migrants , which are delivered to them directly by human traffi@@ ckers , and that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the records of the prosec@@ utor , whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of over@@ throwing the authority of the Italian coast guard , the rescue operations in the area for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the code of conduct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs , who are involved in search and rescue missions , have so far agreed to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not bring any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel prize @-@ winner @-@ organisation is Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minn@@ iti now said that the number of migrants arrived in Italy after the rescue measures has declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens during this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who are leaving these countries hoping to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ ker , the &quot; Berliner Out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate for four days to enjoy tri@@ als and si@@ ght@@ se@@ ein@@ gs .
three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led during hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
there were view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could see far above the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream planes .
in between there were still longer asc@@ ents , for the long trimm@@ ings rewarded .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and to the folk festival saus@@ age market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; again , there was a view point at the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the last two days a lot of altitude difference was announced .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refresh@@ ments brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed healing br@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group met the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally - .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga equi@@ ps itself for e @-@ sport
will the sports stars in future sit in front of computer consoles , instead of being swe@@ at@@ y at the speed of wind and weather ?
fact is : e @-@ sport has long become a serious industry , a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high fees included .
these have also recognized the first Federal Li@@ sts who are increasingly involved in this field .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sports division in mid @-@ July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire new young audiences for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Chairman Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there are still some clubs going on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where gam@@ ers from different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified for example .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sports .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen meanwhile advises one agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds in particular , that young people will go to the stadium in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones .
with high @-@ profile e @-@ athletes under contract , one could be more often present on these markets online than just send back to Asia once a year .
what is it all about ?
for e @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or just football @-@ simulation play FIFA at a competitive level .
as in normal sports , le@@ agues have long established , in which the professionals compete against each other .
and in the Asian Games 2022 , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program .
but is it a kind of sport ?
for many , the idea is certain to get used to .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ous also dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions that you can also find in classic sports - for example increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
in addition , it requires cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and rapid response .
professional gam@@ ers should not only train on the console but also exercise their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the custom player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more a topic . &quot;
controls are difficult to perform in online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing .
the scientist emphasizes the high inclusive effect of e @-@ sport in a positive way .
players are on the go international , this is like a large global family , as there are no intercultural barriers .
a study of corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth for e @-@ sports .
in 2016 , 50 million euros were implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsor@@ ship and big tournaments .
in three years , sales are expected to be 130 million .
this is little against the 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundes@@ liga .
however , e @-@ sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; writes the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many countries are already on the international level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport race provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is also a lot happening in Europe .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a lesson , says F@@ rob@@ ber .
in the Netherlands and France , the football league clubs according to D@@ utt are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sports section .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in European comparison Germany is la@@ gging behind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B Management Board R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just falling into nostal@@ gia and clearing the old times is no longer enough .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but at the same time alig@@ ning the company with the modern market .
&quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ zed world , &quot; says D@@ utt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t keep in mind that only football will remain as it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poison @-@ Eg@@ gs - egg @-@ alternatives for cooking and baking
in the meantime , almost all federal states have been affected by the sc@@ andal about pois@@ oned eggs .
Al@@ di Süd and Al@@ di Nord have re@@ acted and all eggs were taken out of sale in Germany .
in the shelves only eggs are supposed to be taken , which demon@@ stra@@ bly contain no fi@@ pron@@ il .
Michelle Car@@ ter con@@ vic@@ ted of the texts that Con@@ rad Roy ur@@ ges for suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend to commit suicide by text and calls .
Michelle Car@@ ter , 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been exposed to prob@@ ation .
Car@@ ter was sentenced in June for neg@@ ligent killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his vocation .
she had been faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and facing eyes when she was con@@ vic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she ended his life to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she took no responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she showed no repentance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful circum@@ stance that she fully regre@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Ju@@ dge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a public prosec@@ utor read a statement by Roy &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day in which I don &apos;t have the loss of my beloved son .
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try to be there for his sisters , despite all my pain , which we will carry for eternity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the recognition that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not having the only person with whom I have been together every day since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the case seems to set a legal preced@@ ent as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to commit another to commit suicide . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon mon@@ oxide intoxic@@ ation in a vehicle .
the case drew attention to national attention after Car@@ ter revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang up , spring from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news that she had sent before his death in the two weeks before he was on vacation with his family .
in the moments of his suicide she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you must do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said Car@@ ter &apos;s attention was sought by Roy &apos;s death and ordered them to benefit by any press from the event .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
one of the few who defended Car@@ ter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was con@@ vic@@ ted in 2007 because of murder of her British partner in Italy , before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ mich : learning from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ me was allowed to run as a captain during the Audi Cup is no coincidence .
the FC Bayern has a big season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation is not harmful .
there was something different in his room in the cabin , that Joshua Kim@@ i saw immediately , even if the extra piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er were to be seen , he made a rush to his arm .
&quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner after his first deployment as a Bavarian captain .
good , the stand could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign from the coach was able to interpret Kim@@ che as well .
not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a game leader from youth players , de@@ but@@ s and just out of holidays , but he was chosen as a game leader .
sugar is best distributed to those you want a lot to keep in your mood .
so those who were chosen to take the heritage of L@@ ah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
Kim@@ oto confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old was a mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m over the field .
to the right rear , that is his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did the rest .
and Kim@@ i worked at all in this starting formation like the one who can take the ru@@ dder in his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to ste@@ er the un@@ played tro@@ upe .
he had a look for the whole while many others were busy with himself .
Vi@@ dal thus to re@@ play his missing fitness ( folded hard ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ che makes it possible for the devil to get out of the services of the Asia @-@ trip ( also only partly ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le with it not to neg@@ atively impact on their first appearance in the Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t .
after all , it worked very well .
Sü@@ le was running alongside Kim@@ mir , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both acting confi@@ dently .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and Sü@@ le also tried to succeed in playing the game a few times .
his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the outcome was &quot; not as we hoped for . &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance on his debut .

enterprises satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ese minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ p Tempo
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is reflected in more than one year in which the new economic minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the former minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; knowledge gras@@ ps the demands of the economy that le@@ m@@ ke has all blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ us sees the greatest turn@@ around in infrastructure policy : the gap between the auto@@ bahn 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
this year , the ministry hopes for a planning process , until 2021 is expected to be the right of construction .
a role in the plans of the country is also played by the West@@ circum@@ ference Trier , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Office of Transport .
the aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020 , says Minist@@ eri@@ ums@@ spokesperson Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees in it a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competing companies .
the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Trier stri@@ ves to encourage the wine of a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label to boost sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of the German wine exports that has been sag@@ ging for over ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company , praise the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young trainees in the new master bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro is provided for the passed master exam and 2500 euros if graduates within ten years after the master education become independent .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
the planned road construction would be quick to provide facts , but at the same time the country lack@@ ed the necessary personnel , says Jan Glock@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the I@@ HK Trier .
only 29 positions have been staff@@ ed by 56 new engineers who want to employ Wis@@ sing in state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mobility .
the Chamber calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
CD@@ U Group vice @-@ president Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to calculations made by the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in the receipt of country roads than suggested .
in addition , Frank Nat@@ us expects yet another concept of the country to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country is further sober@@ ing .
in 2016 regional companies had only rated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey with a rating of 3,@@ 4 .
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant internet connections and break@@ through@@ s .
ex @-@ Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , on the other hand , is currently out of politics and still sits on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green faction left Lem@@ ke for April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where after four months she already cleared the field for dis@@ agreements .
Audi aims to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW president said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and thus moved to European cities , including Munich , where BMW is located - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the enterprises described the enterprises as a recall .
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions standards .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the cost of the car manufacturers to install systems for neutr@@ alization of exhaust gases produced by diesel vehicles is also increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of using powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes made by Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called isolation devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but driving back under normal driving conditions .
several Volkswagen employees were indic@@ ted in the United States , while others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Itali@@ ans and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circum@@ vent emissions legislation in Europe , and a request focused on the United States has been expanded .
the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to Volkswagen &apos;s win .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft drives through Munich on Saturday , which has a special message .
those who visit the Is@@ ar on Saturday will see a big raft between the F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and this is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the construction paper wants to enligh@@ ten .
on the raft you can see a large inf@@ ran@@ spar@@ ent .
it shows a garbage hill .
the opening of a publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love is ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar should be sharpen@@ ed as a worthy wild river . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer the raft sailed over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior .
Mor@@ dil@@ los no@@ od@@ le n@@ oses and the laughter against the suffering
at times Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most widely published carto@@ ons , the no@@ stri@@ ls of his characters are his trademark .
even with 85 , the Argent@@ inian still stands and works on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ ill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he , among other things , recommended himself as a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for greetings cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , he made a breakthrough at the end of the 1960s : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then also in &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures ca@@ vor@@ t in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own information , he still sits on the drawing table today , works almost ten hours daily .
over cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and clo@@ cks , his dro@@ ll figures continue to find much spread worldwide .
for six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters .
the main person in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - which has a jack of thousands as an opponent .
his figures speak for the first time in the 3D film to come to the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they &apos;ll say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
that is why he relies more on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without words .
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence threatened by climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of the conditions remin@@ ding of drought and due to the diseases transmitted insects , which causes scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , great head@@ aches are prepared .
Eric Cha@@ isse , an expert of the agricultural research institute C@@ RI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence has been effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to climate change in recent years , which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn .
this has effects on the life span of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small ci@@ ch@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ des , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there &apos;s a lot on the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil is not only temp@@ ting for holi@@ day@@ makers , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Eric Cha@@ isse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the solutions that are considered include a better distribution of water and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought .
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thur@@ in@@ gian town of R@@ hö@@ n is celebrating its 1200 years of existence .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children into the office , who were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room : opponents , Neut@@ ral , Al@@ lies .
they ask the repor@@ ters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed , percep@@ tions and gut feelings are sufficient .
there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the pay@@ roll of the government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no resp@@ ite from violence , and while the cor@@ p@@ ses are accum@@ ulating throughout the country , more and more journalists are involved : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to has res@@ ig@@ ned in December 2012 .
among the latter are their editors and their inspir@@ er of Ri@@ dol@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez said in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep even though his presence is everywhere - a great photo of Val@@ dez showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hanging on the facade of the Ri@@ dol@@ ce building . two repor@@ ters in the 19@@ 30s , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts , which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical pan@@ ama .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared themes , trauma , night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although an At@@ tor@@ ney General &apos;s At@@ tor@@ ney General was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , it has only launched two criminal proceedings under the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most thousands of mur@@ ders , each year associated with drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime , the kill@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to trial .
at Ri@@ dol@@ ce , they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ comfor@@ ting and even though the terrain is even more tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting has little value for discussion of security , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why , we all str@@ ust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ dol@@ ce in the capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a couple of blocks before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times he was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated with &quot; twel@@ fth river . &quot;
the sho@@ oter stopped in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around freely in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , since rival fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ storey m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; calm &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drug trade routes in the United States .
nevertheless and despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ dol@@ ce , has broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
first of all , in February the publication of an interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el fac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this release may have anno@@ yed the sons , presum@@ ed gang@@ sters bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was to not force Val@@ dez to leave the country after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country for its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues to establish Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the intoxic@@ ant problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
repor@@ ters loved to publish accurate investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after the foundation of Ri@@ dol@@ ce , she received the prestigious Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize for her reporting in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history wherever she led .
he willingly admitted he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pu@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take over the task assigned to you as a journalist - either you or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ dol@@ ce team miss Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who was able to cur@@ tail like a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table .
now they ask : was his love for routine his cal@@ am@@ ity ?
her death has forced her to question her own assumptions about how best to do her work and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it if you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home starting and landing run@@ ways &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it smells of wrong , stay away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the anger is , said the editor of the Ri@@ dol@@ ce Andr@@ es Vil@@ lar@@ real that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing happened to J@@ avier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape changes constantly .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ dol@@ ce met for safety training , there were suddenly no mobile phones allowed . days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which was sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ size quarter of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the repor@@ ters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who the governor was not trust@@ worthy .
it is months since the repor@@ ters have gone to the mountain scenery , where drug gangs are de facto under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ dol@@ ce has focused on three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former well @-@ known Box@@ er Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an Ex@@ pos@@ é on state expendi@@ tures focused on the city &apos;s hom@@ etown .
and there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all political levels almost the whole century .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ profile cases of corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vil@@ lar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few months earlier , readers had viewed the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source of kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vil@@ lar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slender body . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage room dedicated to characters and sti@@ ckers that protest against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
repor@@ ter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez gra@@ b@@ bed a few signs and went to a demonstration in the morning for another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the whole country , journalists have become lou@@ der , having written in organized protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on foot@@ paths and buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day following the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying on journalists and having them killed because they told the truth .
she has since asked for her to be re @-@ divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surrounded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by organised crime , the government officials involved and an equivalent society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the command of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime .
last year , the media group &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; accounted for more than half of the attacks on journalists of police and civil servants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by Z@@ et@@ as Kart@@ ell : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones lay next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava B@@ reach in March .
others continue as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists escaped from their homeland , or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who will stay back and continue their work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , ad@@ mits that drug trade is frigh@@ tening him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico is going to hell , and that &apos;s why I became repor@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer , when all their phones began to h@@ um .
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with band@@ age riv@@ als and security forces near the seaside resort of Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war further escal@@ ated as promised by a series of cart@@ el emb@@ assi@@ es in the region .
from the ker@@ b edge , they released the news on the website of Ri@@ dol@@ ce via mobile phone .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens raised nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez took a look at the polic@@ emen who kept watch to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid at all , they did not show it .
under the massive portrait of the original founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the members of Ri@@ dol@@ ce followed his tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you only think of closing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if on the same day J@@ avier was murdered , the train@@ ee asked me to send them to the street for reporting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , albeit a frigh@@ tening .
researchers have now found that the first findings of a Canadian min@@ er &apos;s incredible r@@ ash@@ ore have been so well maintained that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they even realized that his sc@@ aly skin was red@@ dish brown - and they said she had had something of a &quot; troubled past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best din@@ osau@@ r din@@ osau@@ r ever found and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his unbeliev@@ ably well preserved condition has amazed researchers who describe it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant e@@ ater is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he dig@@ ged at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine on March 21 , 2011 near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
he hit something that seemed to be out of place by the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy earth cl@@ ump@@ ing .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you just b@@ link a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature can be seen .
&quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers have found that these her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although covered with an arm@@ or and resem@@ ble a changing tank , are probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as a counter @-@ complaint , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed to get better into its surroundings and to avoid its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million year @-@ old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier made head@@ lines in May and is now available at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team who spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to uncover it carefully .
the amazing conservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the head of the creature was darker than its under@@ side .
although the counter @-@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds the animals living today .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs are hun@@ ted by enough pressure by eating din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution fav@@ oured the disgu@@ ise of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or sh@@ ing@@ les - are much smaller and vulnerable than prey , which signals that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period must have been , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also indicates that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was red@@ dish .
scientists continue to investigate the animal with evidence of his life , including his con@@ served intestinal content to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank on his back to the bottom of the sea .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely far more widespread than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved fla@@ ky skin , but remains preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal today looks almost exactly the same as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just go a little with your eyes , you could almost believe he is sleeping . &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period was a time when giant ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , who stood on two legs , crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons heavy monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in the mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn funk , when he dig@@ ged at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine on March 21 , 2011 near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
according to the museum , it is the best arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tops that ra@@ ged from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant e@@ ater was washed by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the din@@ osau@@ r &apos;s underwater cre@@ mation kept its arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are preserved so well that the houses of the houses still cover b@@ ump@@ y ar@@ mor@@ ed plates along the din@@ osau@@ r .
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as &apos; rare as a win in the lot@@ tery .
the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
fossi@@ li@@ zed rem@@ nants of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ our plates carrying the skull of the animal .
his right front foot rests on his side , his five fingers are spread upward .
I can count the scales at his sole . &quot;
in th@@ under storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
heavy accident on Thursday evening at the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are wrapped in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , kilometres long St@@ aus and G@@ aff@@ er .
about 20 people were injured at a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) on Thursday afternoon .
after the first data of the police , around 17.@@ 00 clock between the outlets of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm nearly 30 vehicles , among them probably trucks , crashed into one another .
there are no information about the exact number of injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a light to moderate injuries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large array of emergency vehicles was at the site of the accident .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed in direction of Munich .
in the direction of the direction Munich , a back@@ stage of approximately ten kilometres was formed .
as an A@@ Z repor@@ ter reports , there occurred also on the opposite track to massive disabilities - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire department noted the license plates of the car drivers , which now have to be reck@@ oned with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occ@@ ured at the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : nothing is happening in the train and sleeps .
or you are en@@ gros@@ sed in his work and just have a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ ing .
comes the conductor and ar@@ ouses an uns@@ ink@@ able or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the flaw@@ less ticket inspection .
you simply confirm by your mobile phone that you take your seat and de@@ valu@@ ate your ticket .
a test operation is currently running on two tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the offer arrives , we extend it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be available in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; names the ticket de@@ valuation without the conductor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use it , however , some requirements must be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to have booked an online ticket - what already most passengers do .
it also has to be purchased via the train , the DB navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway .
and last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like this : you step into the train , invo@@ ke your ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a button for the electronic evaluation will then appear with the test customers .
the train atten@@ de@@ es receive a notification on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
when the train atten@@ dant arrives at PLA@@ Y , he knows that there is a passenger with an already validated online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , work on , keep silent .
the check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to travel relaxed without ticket inspection by our train atten@@ dant , you simply check in the DB navig@@ ator yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this enables passengers to make their travel time more personal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Deutsche Telekom &apos;s marketing executive board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket inspections are one of the biggest off@@ ences .
because often you don &apos;t have all the documents you need to de@@ grade online tickets in any case .
either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document you have to assign is missing .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ d@@ ants and passengers , which leads to bad mood in the section or large room and delays in controlling their own tickets and takes the conductor at the end of the time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that is only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
additional gn@@ aw@@ s on the same route are not enabled yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fra@@ ctions ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sha@@ ken to her core .
only one day after they arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment which they rented and sc@@ rolled by Facebook on their phone .
she stum@@ bled over a mail from someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , because nobody else posted the information on her feed , she closed fac@@ ebook and opened Twitter .
a user with Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly saved on her tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was killed by the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretched out on the road and staying there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new to them and their community .
she put her cell phone to return later in the evening to T@@ we@@ ets via people on the Can@@ field Drive .
there were photos of the police @-@ band and people who cried , and of a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed where a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video she said , another polic@@ eman said his gun and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... all animals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Fer@@ rel@@ l &apos;s statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we got used to and which we can typically call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt shaking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and cried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 11@@ pm , she picked up her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the topic of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as starting from the 11th .
it is a story of survival and of protest , love and loss , strength and power of resistance that exists from the point of view of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter , who wore a flower @-@ dress and a matching crown , drove to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two discussed a conversation that they had &quot; over the black experience and the black state countless times before this morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take them away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a cul@@ mination of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know and see it and be drawn up in it .
it must be well developed not only to know activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to free ourselves to free ourselves .
even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a bl@@ at@@ ant rac@@ ism , she is no different from the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the potential non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter were accompanied by a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly , a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my activ@@ ism has changed totally after 9 August , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black congregations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has all come . &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film co @-@ directors during an evening demonstration .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; document &quot; what was happening .
one question was Fer@@ rel@@ l in mind : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of white men - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resili@@ ence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently said in an interview , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We had heard that people born and grown up in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on didn &apos;t make their voices centered and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt in@@ mates .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other natives , the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns &apos;s shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks or speaks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me how these people are represented , for that &apos;s how I &apos;m going to be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ ell &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a Messiah &quot; leader , but a community that is coming together , &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ell &apos;s life , as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the de@@ human@@ ization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ is &apos;s story repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 marked the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the overall movement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must wear the main burden of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no accident , although it was at the forefront because in a life at these jun@@ ctions as a black , gay woman standing so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
in the meantime , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the soci@@ opoliti@@ cal atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
yet she cl@@ ings to a singing and she feels bound to this memory since she walked into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we must love each other and support each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have nothing to lose except our chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania : TV @-@ readers discuss bit @-@ gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though they haven &apos;t been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian prec@@ inct has been dividing the population into pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation of 2009 .
the issue hardly leaves one cold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while some say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This would be great &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery draws more customers into the city , of which the remaining businesses profit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian area will be bleeding .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the plot where the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
this concludes with the start of the construction work .
the Gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Bed@@ a square with the possibility to sit outside .
Sim@@ one Zimmer : &quot; we have been buying in the farmers market hall almost every week for many years now .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the rural women love again and again .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also this .
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall is located in the gallery , depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this should not be very low with the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what do you want to do in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I think that &apos;s superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is already enough of this in our city .
you can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive at the top .
as you can see , shops in a shopping mall are only rented by larger firms , because the r@@ ents there are often not portable for a retailer .
too bad , there are almost no special deals and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit into Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where should the farmers market hall go ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run , if the bit Galerie is actually coming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or does the Ges@@ pen@@ st bit gallery manage to distribute all the stores from Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that won &apos;t work .
and no one needs a shopping center that stands empty .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery .
but there is no room for a peasant market hall thanks to the ins@@ an@@ ely many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg no more .
once the peasant market hall is damaged , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the room at the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are to be seen - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ ti@@ bly identical - that hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and Haar@@ etz , who were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year sentence after making public diplomatic reports on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , is called a Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( matching simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and ground@@ breaking dissi@@ dent , whose condem@@ nation was transm@@ uted by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office .
through algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA extracted by Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data could look like , a sharp , albeit somewhat intellectual commentary not only to the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also created for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but openly talked about identification as a woman since pu@@ ber@@ ty , was con@@ vic@@ ted in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
the prison was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one picture - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ and @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing clearly sits on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came just from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts , such as cigarette but@@ to@@ cks and ch@@ ewing gum , by extrac@@ ting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look .
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed , so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her imprisoned m@@ use became un@@ equal bri@@ des , which over the course of two years exchanged several letters .
they even created a comic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future in which the president would transform Over@@ seas Jud@@ gment and would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as would be a welcome kind of happy meeting .
there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and strong , since Donald Tr@@ ump is leading a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender forces to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to fl@@ are up the rigid spl@@ its he should actually fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a particular reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery Mann@@ ing demanded with her over@@ sized signature below ( the &quot; i &quot; in her sur@@ name is sealed with a heart ) an end to &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thousand of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show by incorporating the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific en@@ cyclo@@ pa@@ edia of the artist ) , as aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully take along is that our gen@@ ome does not care who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned comic book .
she shows Mann@@ ing how she appears with a hands @-@ free phone in his hand from the disciplinary powers of the United States , such as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they kiss your speech , they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so keep your mouth shut . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - as anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it , then she will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simulations , who rally like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ atur ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor at the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University for murder
a nationwide man hunt is underway for a professor at the Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University who are looked for as susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
on Monday for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the Local Court of Cook County reveal .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches .
a public warning system published by the Police Department of Chicago states that the body was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead in the scene of the events , and det@@ ectives investigated the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police actively seek the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
La@@ her has been a associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at the Nor@@ th@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , vice president for university relations , said in an email statement that La@@ them is now in absence and excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities , and the Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an email statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in any way possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he ur@@ ges the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them ampli@@ fy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities are helping to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building that had just received an en@@ ig@@ matic tip saying that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi .
the management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and resear@@ ches a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will finish the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Mut@@ ko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said that it will not take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) are being implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a certain stage of meeting the road@@ map criteria , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ dop@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA timetable was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the timetable of WA@@ DA for compl@@ ying with the code describing the criteria for re @-@ setting R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by WA@@ DA by Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren on alleged publicly funded dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ u@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programmes , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ u@@ ko &apos;s words were consistent with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission .
in conversation with Russian sales point r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov started problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
no one pre@@ tended to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov .
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia in November 2015 as part of the D@@ oping sc@@ andal of WA@@ DA .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow organization in July , WA@@ DA General Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli announced that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA &quot; moves in the right direction &quot; to be used again .

the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your staff at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the poll@@ s didn &apos;t work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful , or worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed .
she has called people from the outside for help .
a new breed of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is on the look@@ out to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it enables companies to address surveys , to offer specialist groups and demographic groups , to provide staff anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to b@@ ypass the C @-@ Suite Exec@@ utives and contact the Board of Directors .
&quot; they now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for pursuing their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said they have a better understanding of what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T .
in addition to the snap @-@ around surveys and surveys of specific teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have most ail@@ ments and which managers have low approval results - so that you can re@@ bo@@ g why .
companies are coming to see that they have to remain at the forefront of workplace culture so that you won &apos;t become the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als , since a former employee published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken have been punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ LIN@@ T this wish for an overview is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
the global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , following the final technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , who helps companies prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year amid the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
cent has nearly 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
u@@ ber has recently signed up as a client .
as G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ cent Enterprise lets you send tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , which allows employees to report bad behavior .
and when the Chief Executive Officer is involved , complaints proceed directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; public opinion condem@@ ns the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and CEO of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company is found that treats its employees badly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has employed Con@@ ver@@ cent for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of policy and procedures and an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
in the past , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often an in@@ timi@@ dation and in@@ convenient experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees .
now that the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that were previously hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states have been identified and addressed more quickly than discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the Risk Management Group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ es Engagement in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service and pol@@ lu@@ te the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that finds the approval of Venture Capital Invest@@ ors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the total capital was raised to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only bets .
the employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if people are happy to be in a company that is worth their votes and that the work you do is worthwhile , they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , who uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies are running well . companies run well when employees are committed and committed .
if the analytics tools of third @-@ party promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement according to the experts in workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ akers of a company do not take action .
indeed , when a company asks staff for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , this can raise dis@@ appointments and dem@@ oti@@ fy employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ask about 4,000 suggestions , you must be willing to have 4,000 discussions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies very well on collecting data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow , associates wonder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now carries out monthly surveys , was able to take action on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ LIN@@ T , so saved .
and after earning feedback from frustr@@ ated collabor@@ ators , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company gets more and more insights into the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to better engagement of workers in a sector that is known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not committed to creating a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , then you will lose companies .
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates the two @-@ day practice and makes a long day for the fry
it &apos;s about 23 : 00 when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA football players conver@@ se on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some have pulled out their jer@@ sey tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these idle minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are enrolled in summer courses will return to their audi@@ ts after three hours of exercise before returning to the Aqu@@ man Football Centre next morning at 6 : 30 p.m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the guys , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jim Mor@@ a , Jim Mor@@ a , just before Monday became Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 7 : 15 pm to meet the already packed timet@@ ables of the players .
the compromise between the two days is more than a day when Bru@@ ins moved the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing times in West@@ wood practi@@ sed practical exercises .
they are supposed to perform 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the start of the formal preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said he supported the change of rules of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they plac@@ ken , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices once the camp is over , which is no easy task in view of the clear sight lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class that has already cleared a net behind a gate post , which will not be an easy task .
Bru@@ ins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are vac@@ ant during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people will rent a room there and then set up there to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape from an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts review in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles to fake news from third parties and then display their results under the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it &apos;s one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will start with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible false messages and send them to fact reviews that may display results of the fact test from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential elections .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan for social media networks to be punished if they fail to quickly eliminate hat@@ eful posts as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook commented in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts review was launched in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; in addition to finding out which stories of fac@@ tual reviews are challenged by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog .
she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature to the &quot; related item &quot; and works on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news .
build a comic @-@ novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 &apos;s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his comfortable seat in the Ir@@ l River valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ i@@ red Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a fon@@ dness for historical documents .
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says .
&quot; what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wi@@ cz , Bri@@ y May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotion@@ ally .
&quot; I only responded to the thumb print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell of smoke ; for at that time a fire was kind@@ led for the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were also there .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ valued my welcome greeting &quot; ) this seems all too nice to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hybrid heads on the walls and bottles who had spent centuries in tren@@ ches .
he wander@@ ed through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape care , gardening and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he drank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whis@@ key and began to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust received full access until 2006 when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ cr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the period of English Emp@@ ires , maps showing who possessed what : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; Rho@@ des says , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families .
&quot; &quot; &quot; guys , let &apos;s go his way ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to pl@@ unge into the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a uph@@ eav@@ al that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rho@@ des .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the two are connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ter , which the Dar@@ rel@@ l family had hidden for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the smu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l was portra@@ yed from the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be quite a fork , always making debts and spending money for things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l men solved their debt crises by getting rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to recru@@ it land@@ owners . &quot;
after the end of his engagement in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences
he spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ mä@@ ki , the terrain of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with the dam@@ n life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : more than 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf covered
the city of Bad Honne@@ f started its campaign for the introduction of a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) on Friday with the inauguration of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf .
until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team headed by Nelson Ar@@ tz want to keep the logo and slogan confidential .
at the end of August , the highlight of the campaign is to celebrate a festival on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers of the promotion have been asking the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think this ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they write on their yesterday released website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically we believe that we , as Bad Honne@@ f , are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , that is to say . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ embra@@ cing promise , one that gives the city a unique unique feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , she stands in competition with other communities .
in the middle five @-@ digit amount , the city of Bad Honne@@ f will cost its new umbrella brand and campaign .
military reform in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises on reti@@ rements and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
like this week too .
at first glance a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the attempted put@@ sch .
the meeting was no longer held in the headquarters of the General Staff , as previously , but in the chair@@ manship of the Prime Minister .
under the presi@@ dency of the head of the government , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Ministers took part in the consultations .
this included the number of civilians in the Y@@ AS .
the government dra@@ gs the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were dismissed .
since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan has fired 16@@ 9 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army , mostly because of alleged links to the movement of the Ex@@ ile Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len that Erdo@@ gan sees as the wire drawing of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people who allegedly participated in the coup attempt , Ankara has been negotiating in Ankara this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the coup attempt as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gift of God &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely clean the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published an article entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ ease in Military Head@@ quarters &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the general staff there are concerns about increasing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the veil for soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in any case , the large @-@ scale teaching of the army and the security forces continues .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan sent another 7@@ 3@@ 95 stat@@ es@@ men , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed that Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als formerly counted as the actual masters of the country .
three times they put@@ ted their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform requirements of the European Union .
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan is target@@ ing Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a particularly un@@ named officer , seeking asylum after the coup attempt in fear of persecution in foreign countries , warned the Turkish army in a few years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this is true , such a development could not leave Nato cold .
in any case , there are doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army in the alliance after the pur@@ ges .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say NATO diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media .
he pre@@ fers to reduce the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers , and will do so by changing the way citizens are dealt with green cards in other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate track for race ticket shuttle
over and over again , over the past few months , the future of the ticket tari@@ ff has been cont@@ ested - now it should go very quickly .
at the end of the year , the track , on which the tourist railway travels , is to be built .
according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work will begin in the course of construction work in the long term in order to secure the future of the race ticket system in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and san@@ ction the Il@@ men@@ au racing section , the country is committed to this particularly important link , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained road Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he reduced the costs for the repair of the track to about 2.5 million euros .
from this sum , the country assumes 75 percent .
the contract , on which the shuttle is to be ordered also in the future from the country , is currently being fin@@ alised , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the South Thur@@ in@@ gia railway as operator are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a duration of eleven years .
in this way , the race @-@ gate @-@ shuttle will be ordered in December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a popular railway link between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g , especially among tourists .
in the course of a pilot operation , in the course of the past few months , it has been tested whether the route is used by sufficient number of people in order to order them regularly in the future .
in addition , the route is very b@@ ap@@ ly in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
just as you thought it won &apos;t be even more crazy in 2017 , a new report will come about the technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are at the moment a big deal .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Emer@@ itus Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and Co @-@ Fo@@ under of FR@@ R , we must start taking her ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will get them much more often , &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey in the publication of his new report .
modern S@@ exp@@ and@@ ppen have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adapt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his robot according to his convi@@ ctions and select everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it becomes even more disturbing since many robots have the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would make a step@@ per woman look progressive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern s@@ exp@@ and@@ als have developed to robots with a silicone skin .
for example , the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the features they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed person@@ ages such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; which gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ end@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is as good as possible to your personality , &quot; enth@@ uses the website of True Compan@@ ion .
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day she also has her m@@ oods - quite like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , be fixed to conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent female characteristics , the all@@ u@@ sions to rape when one walks a step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( i.e. here : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah , distur@@ b one the most .
on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibr@@ ator , why can men not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it is said on the website .
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toys .
their formation and increasing sophisti@@ cation point to something darker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with sub@@ jug@@ ation as an optional en@@ core .
most men , of course , will not keep sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notes their growing popularity , they remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture .
but what se@@ eps out of the boundary zones can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of the time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time when women &apos;s rights are threatened all over the world , in which there is a president in the White House that has bo@@ asted to have women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted .
the most horrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the ent@@ win@@ ed body and the exposed eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap .
the aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( although with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their gro@@ wers want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women .
they cannot separate or simply go away from their companion .
they have no mediation or background history , nothing hin@@ ting independence or anything that could distur@@ b the fantasy of total submission .
in other words , they are pleasing slaves .
or to express it in the Spe@@ ech of 2017 : maid
pumps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human understanding
it has become a rush of the plat@@ former era that the political spl@@ its which pol@@ arized US voters have split families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump choosing relatives .
we all allegedly strict ourselves to burst our filter bubbles .
less noticed is the power of Tr@@ umps to bring together families .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a le@@ aning poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , anyone who knows them , including the repub@@ li@@ can relationship with which they had fought for decades for politics , suddenly and very especi@@ al on the same side .
this is certainly a good thing about the dining table , but it is obvious to me that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the overwhelming effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dump &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that his cat will no longer rep@@ el us one day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is , however , an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the Right wing are &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards .
nowadays I find myself covered by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s hil@@ arious version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both in fact seem to be a very mild offen@@ se .
if Tr@@ ump is going , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must be only spiritually healthy to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our kids to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York Parks Department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are enormously large , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are bul@@ ky and the animals twist to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely glo@@ omy and the climate @-@ per@@ ating music con@@ veys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city does not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not over the day when I found that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the themed pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage counts not - but a large round@@ about in the north of London .
however , the Central Park @-@ car@@ ous@@ el still has a strange magic experience , as two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go to it and all have a great time .
if I could have assessed the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked for it afterwards .
on the other hand I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something over the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required .
the poor woman in the department store stood ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ tically , while I was tired of the experience of submitting to her my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year he was brought to the hospital due to the treatment of cuts to his w@@ ri@@ sts , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death belt because of murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day in 2013 , firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a noc@@ turn@@ al intru@@ der hiding in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time to the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , which they say is too len@@ i@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Prosec@@ ution Authority said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the obj@@ ection could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us runs the risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ quarters of F@@ itt@@ ens and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were dischar@@ ged into the holidays and the secondary schools .
three of the students will go to college in the future , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening school director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
the 29 students of the four classes under the direction of Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der chose a young Eagle , who grew up in the poultry farm , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the m@@ lower Sch@@ ar introduced a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the poultry farm &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and left it out of its chi@@ ckens .
instead of chi@@ ckens , a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of him was sm@@ ashing , and the vul@@ ture spread out his wings on a high mountain .
after that the classes showed three and four in the studio of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln , the cylinders carried to the bet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Eagle stands for integration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chief Ju@@ dge An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the young animal is different from the other young ( chi@@ cks ) , but belong to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his destiny is to be free .
she wished every four @-@ year @-@ pup@@ il that he feels accepted in his new school .
there was a thank @-@ you to the colleagues , the former school manager Michael Müller , who always jumps in with instruc@@ tive pas@@ sports , and the parents &apos; representatives .
the kitchen time now is over , class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher .
she left her students very reluct@@ antly after two years of learning because it was a really great time .
finally they could rely on the four @-@ quarters @-@ quarters .
at the end all students let a song of summer time and holiday time sound .
there was great joy with the children .
eight first @-@ grade students have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were arrested for illegal camp@@ ings in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted on TV , announced .
on the morning of 1 August , a group of illeg@@ ally ro@@ oting people was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia by the police , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released while an investigation is underway .
B@@ TV reported that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control over the free camping and put anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , considerable fin@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inspections are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said the court could impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what suffer@@ ers need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in the action ?
an overview of the most important questions and answers .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they are intended to improve the emissions behaviour of cars in the emission class Euro 5 and in part Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin from ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action obligatory ?
no , the software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the obligatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that make the Schum@@ an software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Office of Kraft@@ fahrt ( KBA ) has ordered their retro@@ fitting .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced a spe@@ edy implementation over the next few months , but they have not yet given an exact date .
Daimler indicated that each person concerned should be contacted .
if an inspection is required anyway , that will be done within the scope of the inspection .
how long should the conver@@ sions go in total ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
this depends on the company &apos;s commitment and political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , the autom@@ akers are not acting voluntarily on the subject of the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long will the update last ?
the ref@@ itting could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
it could be time @-@ consuming to make an appointment .
what do mot@@ orists do that are not driving cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ace advises to wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would reti@@ re , such as S@@ met@@ anin .
does a massive price decline of Euro @-@ 4 cars thre@@ aten now ?
the ACE is fear@@ ing this .
but just in regions where driving prohi@@ bitions thre@@ aten .
in rural areas there is currently no loss of value for older diesel engines .
the ACE advises to wait for sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of Washington &apos;s most gl@@ amor@@ ous events .
the first prize @-@ giving ceremony under President Tr@@ ump is promising to become political .
one of the winners doesn &apos;t want to come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center .
this year , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lad ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the hon@@ ours .
the awards will be presented at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and join his wife Mel@@ ania at the award ceremony .
the award winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV shows already announced to abst@@ ain from participating in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presi@@ dency has decided to neg@@ lect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ving them of the means - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed that she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to make her view clearer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kennedy Center named after former president John F. Kennedy is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
the former award winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ lach &apos;s city builder , will reti@@ re next year .
the position is already written - but suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker has been a city builder for 31 years .
and the work still makes him great fun as he communic@@ ates in the press conference .
he reports of varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his success@@ ors .
at the same time , it wonders that no application has yet to fulfil the requirements profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
so - considering the regular periods of notice - should be enough time for a famili@@ ar@@ isation .
since Has@@ lach functions as a Lower Stru@@ c@@ tural Authority for the Administr@@ ative Community , the applicant must submit corresponding conclusions .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if they couldn &apos;t fill them out , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice .
but the proximity to the citizens is important to the city and to it itself , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate and a good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years in ministry , some major projects have accumulated to look back at the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure of the Bau@@ amt and its staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the remo@@ del@@ ing of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen park@@ platz , for example , have been initiated .
the bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the renovation of the stadium is still a topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter will roll with some 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
in terms of design , there is a great scope for a city builder .
with Has@@ la@@ ken &apos;s own building yard and gar@@ dener it is possible to react flexibly to much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the old town as an ensemble is under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye for what fits &quot; when new buildings are approved , the reti@@ ring city builder emphasizes .
anyway , the City Buil@@ der bears high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is the builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , everything here goes over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of supervision and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been here for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) has been working for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker wants his successor to stay for a long time : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city .
if you want to inherit Roland W@@ acker , after information from the town of Has@@ lach , you should have a completed academic studies as a graduate engineer or a Bachelor &apos;s degree of architecture and have good expertise in the areas of construction and construction planning law .
the Municipal Building Department is subject to civil and civil engineering , construction management , basic renovation , administration of urban property , urban working farm with building yard and urban gar@@ dener , as well as a civil protection authority , including a monument protection .
bicycle on lines thrown : South track closed
according to the police , the previously unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bike on the lines of the railway crossing in the area of Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) .
these were damaged so severely that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and have been looking for them since the night hours .
close to the crime scene , a ros@@ y sco@@ oter and a bicycle driver were observed by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ itz@@ ring empire , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch on the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ators would have put themselves in great danger themselves and also je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the installation as well as the delay and the costs for rail transport , pat@@ rons of the railway customers could also come to the perpetr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; overall , there was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum to go out , the speaker said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the south railway track could be managed without obstruc@@ tions .
almost ten passenger trains dropped out on Friday morning , two of them covered the long @-@ distance traffic .
freight trains did not fall out , but they were delayed .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , around 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate may help to allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study is just the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the incur@@ able condition in the United States affects approximately 1.3 million and in the UK 300@@ ,000 , causes stomach cra@@ mps and blo@@ ating , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while those affected are usually advised to ste@@ er meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han protein contributes to developing immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant gut .
the leading researcher , Dr Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells pat@@ rol in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food do not penetrate into the body .
cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
when the balance is too far toward inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
in experiments , it has been found that a type of tolerance promoting immune cells occurs in mice carrying a specific bacter@@ ium in their bow@@ els .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han encourage more toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ lieu , if the same system also works with people .
the post @-@ doctoral candidate , Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan , examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe that was separated from it had not .
it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ographies of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the mice &apos;s intest@@ ines were sequ@@ enced and six species found in mice with the immune cells were found , but without them missing in mice .
mice were taken up in a sterile environment , so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this kind of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria spread on the immune system , the researchers led L. reu@@ ter@@ i to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to un@@ ripe immune cells isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant @-@ promoting cells .
when the active component was cleaned from the liquid , it turned out to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ metabolism , known as in@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of the mice , the number of cells increased by about 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same toler@@ ant @-@ promoting cells as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inside surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; to N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria .
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup starts against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the owner &apos;s role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will .
matic , however , was excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and only managed 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
beside M@@ atic Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u started in the Avi@@ va Stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed in this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho had three more new commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfill three of its four priority obligations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; getting three out of four , I thank the club , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have made great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the plane manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew away from Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in US state Mich@@ ig@@ an and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner via the U.S. , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the shape of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo in the sky was painted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turns , as Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD boss , social @-@ democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with a certain concern .
only a fire from the central party , but no head@@ wind from the League - was the most important wish of the electoral champi@@ ons .
since Martin Schulz has been leading the party , this has changed fundamentally .
since then , the employees of the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus have observed with growing horror the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with head@@ winds .
there were hits .
one after the other .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against the coalition of SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows once again : red @-@ green can simply not be more reliable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber , Germany &apos;s editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surprising fraction of a Gre@@ ens Euro MP has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a serious crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the Parliament election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green federal managing director Michael Kell@@ ner called on the back@@ sliding Lower Saxony MEP El@@ ke T@@ westen to give back her mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen there must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal managing director and election director of the Gre@@ ens to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD bal@@ ancer si@@ gh@@ ed , when the new hi@@ ba message reached the party headquarters on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , the prime minister of the SPD of Lower Saxony , stands for the CD@@ U without own government majority after the green Euro MP El@@ ke T@@ westen combined .
it is the preliminary peak of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD regional associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ery began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat of the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , no more , was comfor@@ ting the comrades at that time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
that was also the case - and everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into a swing , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ gh sli@@ pped the party smoothly .
the comrades were lab@@ ori@@ ously resting again in the weeks afterwards .
then , when they had just had new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him came the next deep beat .
mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD deputy , lost his Nim@@ bus that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because he did everything wrong in crisis communication afterwards , which one can do wrong .
since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for its political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
for some time now , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has already been critic@@ ised for the VW @-@ emission standards and its role in the Supervisory Board .
the survey results were added .
nevertheless , or maybe just because , in recent weeks , Wei@@ l tried to set accents in the Con@@ federation .
the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin did not remain concealed by comrades in the environment of Martin Schulz .
they let him alone , as they promised to stabili@@ ze the party by Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could occur .
at the same time Wei@@ l meets the party @-@ internal compul@@ sion of the Lower Saxon Gre@@ ens in essence no fault .
and Schulz is not at all .
for the time being , the comrades try to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the back@@ sliding parliam@@ ent@@ ari@@ ess T@@ westen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is int@@ ol@@ erable and democratic as Mrs. T@@ westen put her own career eating over the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the Editorial Board Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. T@@ westen has not been elected to Parliament because of her person as a direct candidate , but on the national list of the Lower Saxon Gre@@ ens , so the Lower Saxon parliament continues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , lam@@ ents an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters &apos; willingness four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l as prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a leading candidate in the election of the Bundestag , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U Euro MPs fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he demanded clari@@ fying the background .
I want to know if there has been more or more further commitments made by the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
funding for town core III
those who want to rehabil@@ itate his house in the years can soon get support from the country .
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representative St@@ eg urban development on Wednesday in sensation .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler took a look back at what was going on until now .
since 1991 , there have been in sensi@@ tis@@ ation areas .
at that time , in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two thirds of the funding amount .
the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent in the refurb@@ ishment area II from 2005 to 2016 .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous refur@@ bish@@ ments are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is ultimately important to promote interior development , and not only to open up new construction areas .
on April 4 , the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a refurb@@ ishment area III .
the funding amount was 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which 500@@ ,000 euros came from the country , the rest of the community felt .
how is a san@@ itation area created ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will continue to investigate the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role , whether in the planned area of interest , to rehabil@@ itate .
if necessary , the area boundaries could be post@@ p@@ one again .
the bridge was on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal state programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which the re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , the improvement of living and working conditions and maintenance and expansion of the infrastructure .
the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , that is , per plot .
the re@@ development area would eventually be defined as a statute .
the eligi@@ bility period for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
however , until September of this year , however , the survey will take place only once , within the framework of which the parties involved in the rehabilitation area will receive a questionnaire for filling out .
in November or December , the statute shall be carried out as soon as possible so that the re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings can begin next year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently explained that each commune must carry out the said screening tests .
it is a question of evaluating and deciding on the urban ab@@ norm@@ alities when it is being rehabil@@ itated and to what extent .
for the respective property there will be a remedi@@ ation note in the land register .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will even come back to his feelings and take a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel emphasized that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires that will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and be filled up until the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which includes , among other things , the structural condition and the renovation views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ous@@ ehold and H@@ ousing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; information about size , layout and residents of a residential area can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operating arc &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to be filled out if business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it is important to note that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler stresses that the distribution of funding is working according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; - who comes first , ad@@ mon@@ ishes first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you cannot reserve funds for later &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local politicians II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; renovation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or uses himself a micro@@ chip to get into house and car with a hand movement
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through their company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a Consult@@ ative aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to the medical standard .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks at houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for an extra charge of £ 300 per castle .

the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pa@@ yer thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a nav@@ al helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights the American manufacturing last month will cost tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military &apos;s data handed over to the TI@@ ME magazine , up to $ 24@@ ,000 .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the President is on board , was the cent@@ er@@ piece of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the helicopter , made in Connec@@ ti@@ cut , was on display next to a yacht made of Ma@@ ine , a Wis@@ con@@ sin fire@@ man car and a Miss@@ issi@@ ppi forkli@@ ft truck .
the White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superi@@ ors , the Deputy Nav@@ al Commander for Aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the news showed that the helicopter arrived on the South La@@ wn on July 17th at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed , a second team would be required for the return flight due to the restriction of the hours of service .
the original flight crew was during the event during the helicopter , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane .
from the records provided by the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was required .
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal employees to use state ownership for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event might viol@@ ate the destination .
&quot; one question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the command@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds like you &apos;re locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated as an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but even official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave a stimulus to reform the health reform that was going on in the Senate and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government legislation .
the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but demanding their use only for a photo surgery is unusual .
in February , Tr@@ ump conducted an investigation , when the presidential aer@@ op@@ lane performed in front of the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages compla@@ ining about the use of the presidential jet by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deputy Secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently carry out training flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn to counter the U.S. president in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 conducted 58 practice land@@ ings at the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event consisted of the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
helicop@@ ters flew 11 hours on that day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget records for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the 2017 budget year , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour .
the unit records the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; determining the tax@@ pa@@ yers &apos; cost on the basis of estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but also account for the cost of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of contract .
at that time , the former press spokesperson of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things that are made in America this week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume hundreds if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think most Americans are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , it is appropriate to highlight that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear if Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire fighter car .
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss before tri@@ cky job
fron@@ trun@@ ner of the second Bundes@@ liga ki@@ cks off at the Table 3 , Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
the TC blue @-@ white Ne@@ uss will start tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel near the Table 3 , Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
despite five games still flaw@@ less balance , the leader of the second tennis league took the sense of reality .
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay certainly has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially on the back positions I find the team very good . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V especially imports from the high north are concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to bets in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in the double , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Heli@@ ova ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ go ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult for us as always . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good portion of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high North is convenient .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ four .
if the Fren@@ ch@@ man in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fren@@ ch@@ man is not part of the Bundes@@ liga , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) is playing at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec ( Czech Republic ) for his first time in this season .
the Un@@ defeated Chil@@ ene Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Cas@@ tillo yesterday was at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el with the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski .
he should also be present in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ ow@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and Belgian Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories on the last Sunday against the club on the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could also come back to the team .
if it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was still the number one of the junior world rank@@ ings in January 2016 , someone from the train@@ ee round Mari@@ us Z@@ ay fills the cad@@ re .
how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump was not really happy when he placed his signature on Wednesday evening under the law of tightening the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he et@@ ched a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ amed the US advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft plan is to punish European companies which help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors of the O@@ MV are concerned , who jointly with other European companies financed the construction of the Russian Eastern sou@@ jour@@ n Nord Stream 2 .
the threat of dr@@ one is enormous .
nevertheless , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump himself would have to raise the sanctions by executive order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has looked at which the Group could a@@ vert and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Rel@@ ay 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el will focus on Net@@ fli@@ x &apos;s hit series
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Killer reveals , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is not over yet .
the relay three and four were already confirmed by streaming service , the first received its first trailer and showed the latest villa@@ in of the show .
with the third season , DE@@ A has focused its attention on the rich@@ est organisation of drug trade in the world : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 Company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only with more government bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) is comm@@ anding the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ ac@@ ote ) is located in New York .
in the newly published trailer , Pedro Pascal returns to J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement agencies to support the war against drugs .
other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry al and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .
the third season of Nar@@ cos will start on September 1st .
roll back : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the city re@@ organizes the K@@ ita lunch table itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the urban day care centres , the clock is turned back .
on 1 September the city of Kre@@ feld will take over the food supply in the urban day care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again in O@@ reg@@ ie .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy director in the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot;
cooking is continued outside the house : a cat@@ erer takes on this task and supplies freshly cooked .
the city runs 46 kinder@@ gar@@ tens in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 children get a hot meal at mid@@ day .
in the last kit@@ esur@@ fing year 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables , and the need grows constantly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , not only children who are cared for 45 week@@ days are in the K@@ ita at lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour supervision when children stay up to 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time staff from 1 September cooking service : they warm up the delivered food , supplement them with salad , raw vegetables and fruit , portions the meal individually , give the food off , clean and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are two groups as well as seven @-@ group facilities - decide on the ho@@ ur@@ ly range .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen assistants are now part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ Ã anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for hospital ei@@ vers to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about : healthy food and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleaning of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm of the quality improvement of the kitchen performance as well as the charm , which it has turned out in the cost comparison between self @-@ regulation and foreign assignment for the city as the most economical , it says from the press office .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re@@ positioned .
&quot; but these hours are not so much in weight at around 750 people in the education area , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all the members of society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , President of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women are running in the provinces in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of the Vice @-@ President and more than 30 per cent of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credi@@ ble when women fully participate and be involved in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and presidential elections take place on 5 April .
the Tali@@ ban have published threats against a choice process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international fighting actions to an advisory role .
this year , the elections for the first time will hand over the power peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ som said a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women were registered by a total of 3.4 million registered voters .

G@@ MB concerns about investment in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glas@@ gow
a union wants to ensure a long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glas@@ gow , with managers from the Bis@@ kup@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company had weighed over the future of investing in the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work at the plant , which produces hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea bis@@ cuits in addition to other products .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s representative , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s call for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerns that funding for the modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be pushed forward &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross is deeply affected by our members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generations of families have worked here and the workers strongly focus on the local community and the large Glas@@ gow community , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage .
hence , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glas@@ gow urgently needs a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the manager at T@@ oll@@ cross yesterday received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland and the company will react immediately as we value continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we , like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate , constantly review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - in order to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross location , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility fully and entirely . if our operational processes change at the site , employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did PS@@ G Barcelona warn against N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La League may regret their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not leave N@@ ey@@ mar in the pursuit of a £ 18@@ 9 million offer to release its release cl@@ auses , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago in front of the record of the world record ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the league 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United for 89 million pounds last season .
after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional ath@@ lete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of over 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a spring near the Catalan Executive Board insi@@ sts that the club always did its best to take care of him since his arrival in San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned against this prospect three years ago by the PS@@ G president ?
when Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , we &apos;ll be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , whereby the Spanish association expressed interest in PS@@ G central @-@ field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel down under any circum@@ stance , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offerings for N@@ ey@@ mar .
sco@@ oter dropped and damaged
in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown offen@@ ders intentionally threw a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ feld street in front of the property number 30 and so on the fair@@ ing of the vehicle damaged by more than 200 Euro .

the police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
because he had a car in his lane , the driver had to do@@ dge a VW Tour@@ an and tou@@ ted the crash barrier .
on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um had arrived on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au at 19.@@ 55 o &apos;clock in the direction of Le@@ ese .
in the area of the outskirts of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger came to meet him on his lane , so he had to turn right .
the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ ted the crash barrier .
non @-@ functional damage was created on the passenger car .
the driver of the opposite car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident .
according to the accident victim , it can be good that the Mer@@ ced@@ es@@ driver had not noticed the accident at all .
the police are now asking witnesses of the incident , as well as the driver of the perpetr@@ ator , to contact the comm@@ iss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au under tel . 05@@ 7@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 .
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Report reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atz @-@ Report on the mis@@ use cases is reli@@ eved by Pope @-@ Brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are the Church , &quot; declared after publication opposite the German Press Agency , as expected by the former Regensburg Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology .
it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger expressed their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false assessment of the processes .
the Vatican Daily , &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand critici@@ zed that when reporting about violence in the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , &quot; double standards &quot; were measured .
with regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubt that it is &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation &quot; is striking , such as the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria , Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Ta@@ xis , spoke with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; you &apos;re going to go to the church and that &apos;s a dev@@ oured face . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pun@@ ches were a normal educational tool &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to deal with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would be unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to past decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with reports on abuse cases , often pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; completely wrong , author and historian Michael hes@@ emann , who wrote &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I must take refuge in Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with it , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report .
what exactly is the 440 @-@ page report published by the B@@ ish@@ um Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Regensburg domains were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the early 1990s , with high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of over@@ taking , 67 dom@@ es sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report , it is said about Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in conclusion , it can be said that Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. generally used forms of physical and psychological violence .
especially in the case of high emotion@@ ality , punishment for the students could be even more severe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , unlike many other defend@@ ants , many victims believe that many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even positive memories are linked to him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview , E@@ zek@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal involving the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , is reli@@ eved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incidents of violence on protective rights at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one , many students highlight his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears as ch@@ ol@@ eric and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who became more tangible when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz musical didn &apos;t perform top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all present in it .
he has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or co @-@ operation in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool were also ex@@ propri@@ ated outside of its sphere of influence .
it is possible to reproach him at best , to know from it too late or to have taken first hints not seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , in which he worked , was perceived by virtually all those inter@@ viewed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rede@@ mption &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the broad majority of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s students have a very excellent testimony , &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; honest , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; honest , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher , who regularly nour@@ ished the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compla@@ ins about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotional appeal , which also led to flood out@@ breaks .
the fact that he didn &apos;t just pop with chairs and threw the key@@ chain on the floor , but also pulled the ears and too che@@ ek@@ y guys on the hair or ears , he admitted even years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for that .
however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the early 1960s and 1970s , both in parents and in teachers .
do you also know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state school .
compared to what it actually is about in this report , namely , the app@@ alling sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school , these are certainly Bag@@ at@@ ella .
one wonders whether it is not more likely to do with his fame and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI that many media rus@@ hed straight to him .
many who have never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently on the Bavarian pop@@ e .
but the truth is : the report is reli@@ eved by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , in connection with the report , a great deal was reported about the abuse of the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also accused of involvement in sexual abuse in the final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claimed to have entrusted themselves to the cath@@ ed@@ ral@@ â s master .
not even the parents were initiated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of those affected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in educ@@ ating sexual abuse was and is , however , that most of the victims are silent .
if they did not even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a chor@@ us leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators professionally .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen pupils judge R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role with regard to the mis@@ use cases ?
Michael hes@@ emann : a questioned student put it in this way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetr@@ ator .
I consider it ... also for really absurd to assume that all of you ... Bu@@ ben have opened up more intru@@ sive or more clear or even more , than against their parents , dormit@@ ory managers , trust teachers etc .
that one talks about sex with him ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the report concludes with the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the students and / or their environment entrusted to him in the run @-@ up could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore exemp@@ ted from any co @-@ knowing .
so he cannot be accused of not being prevented or brought to the ad .
therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these disgu@@ sting crimes , as was unfortunately done in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was to be read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking away &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this reproach ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem in reporting everything mixed and mixed into a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is precisely the mis@@ use of the report .
there is , namely , clean@@ ly separated : between the pre @-@ school and the Gymnasium of Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses as well as , let &apos;s say , other alleg@@ ations .
in addition , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral conductors of the cathedral spar@@ rows .
the whole horrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which the boys of the sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were properly har@@ assed and mal@@ ol@@ erable and were horri@@ bly oppressed , all took place at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where there really had to be sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions .
but with those , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he had to face the boys only when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on that , as most witnesses stress , the subject &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre @-@ school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; t@@ abo@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one was only happy to escape from her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paradise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what was different on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael hes@@ emann : there was already discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic power reigned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and therefore in many cases even positive memories combined with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , at most , the reproach is to have looked away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 @-@ 71 , when he began to establish himself and of the events at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( as the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then again around 1993 .
Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently gave his ears to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ?
Michael hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report actually reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out this to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pre @-@ school the test penalty will continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
already in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed when Prü@@ fin@@ es were also banned in Bavaria long ago .
before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as each of us probably knows .
it was difficult for him to estimate where the affected persons might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he would have looked away all the time .
that simply is not true .
it was only in 1980 that the prison sentence at schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Ta@@ xis argued that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s educational standards to that time .
how do you see that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael hes@@ emann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we historians are talking about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trap of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. the danger of evaluating the past according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess was right .
but this is of course not true for sexual abuse , which was ab@@ hor@@ rent at all times , and not for what was f@@ aded away in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond what was at that time .
it &apos;s all terrible and I &apos;m glad that it &apos;s finally being worked up .
but at the same time I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing , i.e. sla@@ ying the ears and the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then banned , he also strictly adher@@ ed to it .
what image of his Regen@@ s@@ burger time did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger play in the conversations with you for the book &quot; My Brother of the Pope ? &quot;
did the subject test sentence also come into speech ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , i.e. Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells from his perspective , as the dom@@ es played only a minor role .
nevertheless , I did not by any means forget that he led a strict regi@@ ment there .
but this also has to be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demand of unconditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ g , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y alone , one does not even make out of un@@ ru@@ ly boys a great singer and before any success , right in which field , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of people did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger have experienced during the talks on their book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I have met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful , humor@@ ous , basic , deep @-@ believing and heart @-@ good people , of whom one cannot imagine that even a fly could do something .
I regularly get in touch with him , like many former dom@@ es still today , 23 years after his retirement , regularly contact him , visit him , read it - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family .
those who do not forgive him until today , that he was once strict with them , are thus clearly in the minority .
today , most of the domains are thank@@ ful to him that he en@@ riches their lives and brings the world of music to them .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but it was also a lovely respect , to which they still look up and rever@@ e them .
and please , once more clearly : all you submit to it are educational methods that were on the order of the day .
we can be glad that we have long ago overcome this time .
but it is most un@@ just , a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intention behind it , only too obvious .
for the report that has just been published reli@@ eves him .
now the status quo , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man , who acquired great mer@@ its and without whom nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , would finally be in peace .
