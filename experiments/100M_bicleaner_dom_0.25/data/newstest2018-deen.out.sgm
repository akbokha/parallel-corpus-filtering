<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irish institution, where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A chapel that is now dug for the S-Bahn (S-Bahn) tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners manage the former cause of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories to day.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying if maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this, who had to get excited, because the Auto-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bavaria of the state government, are anything but up-to-date - but especially very informative.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare it with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Mercury since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria Atlas is a Flickenteppich, which one recognizes as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large overview map, detailed maps for cities and municipalities were incorporated, so-called Urpositional Sheets.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bayerische Staatsgemungsverwaltung between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army captain occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon desired an overview of the occupied country and commissioned Bavaria's topographic survey - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops were finally pulled off with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801, they were the current neighbours who created the idea of a covering Bavaria card.</seg>
<seg id="18">Elector Max IV further drove the project forward, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Association of Surveying.</seg>
<seg id="19">The composition sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all others on the Bayerische Landesbibliothek's website.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of former / today is most impressive in the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was established 21 years after the map was created, thus in 1877, as a Munich suburb.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is situated in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings concentrated around 1856 along the present Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser only in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: zooming in appears a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbered fleets from the so-called "primeval" from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots are no longer occupied by farmers, but farmers in the "land in the sun" system.</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is distinguished north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">Theresienwiese, the scene of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact a meadow - and not a concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the area of today's Au-Haidhausen district, one reads not only the street name "at Gasteig" or from the "Auf der Lüften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one once closed people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich district-Irrenberg" "" "Auf der Auer Lüften" "" "was created there." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden was the head of the institution - a psychiatrist in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended up for example the chains of the so-called Irish." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he prohibited the staff to resort to violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen museum, who worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">There was space for 280 patients, later it was expanded to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrivals, has been located there since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people in the Munich Salesianum meet on the grounds of the former Auer Institute.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order purchased the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth hostel with training facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football field of the TSV München East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the children house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was built - in an architectural reference to the original construction of the Irrenberg, which had been destroyed during the Second World War during bomb attacks." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed as" "" "Main Square" "" "around 1856, the shopping street called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War brought a decisive change also in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">In December 1944, the Allied bombs destroyed many holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days were the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn pedigree will take place.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights group announces travel warnings for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for Farmers' Promotion has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which will enter into force by August 28, 2017, asks Afro-American travellers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention when travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, racial-based occurrences occur in the entire state and are noted here," says the Group's opinion.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently passed law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to gain discrimination, as well as the state prosecuting authorities, who are disproportionately aimed at minorities, prompted the group to release travel warnings, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin colour, they are killed or killed, "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents like racist crime against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state and was put into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points out a recent report from the Missouri Generalate Office in which black motorists in the state will be held 75 percent more often than white.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be willing to bring chewing money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri posted 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report that classifies the state with respect to the number of such violations on the 16th place of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after States had passed immigration laws, committing local law enforcement agencies to arrest people because of immigration violations, which will contribute to further racial profiling in view of the ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">The electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischbacher Hof-Weidejn-Project is a successful project and will continue next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac provided an image on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the panel of the Schwendemann family representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU village association met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann initially gave insights into his farm, in which he cultivated 55 hectares of lawns and 40 hectares of forest, 40 milk cows and also many young animals and accommodated in five apartments holiday guests.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Black Forest milk" "" "is the alternative marketing path for him for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the holiday guests only regional comes.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "as he is also the BLHV chairman of Fischbach, he described the electric fence project as" "" "elementary important" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot generate profit on such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area care for a lot of work, a lot must be processed with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight here with the conditions and topography," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if it did not lead to organic farming.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" "" "the municipality has recognised the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader promotion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the afforestation of the land could be extended quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they will continue their operation," "" "said the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers often stand in criticism because of the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 parcels were fenced off by 11 participants in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The conservation area is therefore 40 hectares, which must not be afforested by at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of 71 500 Euros, half was promoted over leader, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">This means that the farmers had to invest 12,610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you are doing a really good job without farmers and mermaids." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "also for Peter White stood firm:" "" "best food is produced here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Federal Countryside (LPR) Baden-Württemberg grants the state funding of soft fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to open the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The prerequisite is the presence of a grant set by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the area to be enumerated must not be serviceable (inclination over 35 per cent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">The application of eight participants with 24 parcels, which would like to build 16 kilometres of fence, is currently running for the fisher "Fischbacher Hof 'in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="96">The accounting area equals 35 hectares, the calculated costs lie at more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos plaza in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump régime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta from CNN about the President's proposals for the drastic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller did not pick up the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and liberty-imitators would have agitated him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he took on their importance, and in particular the meaning attributed to her when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, seventeen years after the completion of the monument, was added to his base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta complained, "I don't want to go down to a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem you refer to, added later, and not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is factually correct, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance of the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, your oppressed masses who longed for free breathing, the wretched waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "waking waste" "" "on our screens was better to see." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not commit himself to literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trump USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is in fact a conflict about the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place her words after her death at the base - knew very well that she took up a highly political act.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a traditional pictorial representation.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus had changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great cry of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anybody, but rather an early neo-conservatism that brings the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty progressing.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch shall not enlighten the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is quite unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great fanciful act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often horrible voyages on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch shall not light the way, but ignite the hatred which is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scotsmen belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">The performance director of the United Kingdom's athletics track, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent will make a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athlets was selected for London 2017, starting on Friday.</seg>

<seg id="137">And also with the type at the corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athlete are medals contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain by the team.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is rather modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "their speech was incredible," "" "says Black." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">"" "the passion and genuine feeling that Eilidh brought in naturally were great." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hurdle, says that it is "incredible" that 16 Scotsmen are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best overall number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">"" "" "" "the middle-distance runner Muir leads this way and has set up five British and two European records last year." ""</seg>

<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch after a great season, which included the victory of the British team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell was.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain says that they are "hugely proud" to the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also join medals and finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammers voted for me and chose me to make it something very special for me," she added.</seg>

<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>

<seg id="155">What concerns my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>

<seg id="160">Blocking Critics on Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating up of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him for everything, from domestic politics to political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He leaped in criticism, confident.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "because in the year 1783 Washington said," "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and silent we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">That brings me to Maryland, Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on being more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And therefore the American Civil Liberties Union sued him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"" "the governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter reaction with" "" "Na, and?." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "" "" "it's just Facebook," "" "said many people." ""</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it's a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful in using Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and play his hairy head for chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of persons coming to the site of the Governor - which is a public forum that is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked to some of the real people that were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only true people who speak to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest recited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the commentary section "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I also don't appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same topic, then they are ignored by some rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what the staff of the governor referred to as" "" "concentrated spam assault" "" "would probably call others" "" "intercession" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest and silence demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accused of Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this issue was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County last violated the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers was multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers entered into his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius," wrote all the letters of newspapers that made Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions, who criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, the trade and shipping with Great Britain, overcame his office, according to the historical documents collected by the Online Papers of the George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not silence her.</seg>
<seg id="204">Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses are the basis of our nation.</seg>

<seg id="421">Electro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk enjoys with the huge number of preorders for his new Tesla Model 3.</seg>
<seg id="422">So far he has underestimated that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.</seg>
<seg id="423">In addition to the ever triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed a different, less glamorous figure on the announcement of the latest quarterly balance: that of the cancellation of the new mass market model 3.</seg>
<seg id="424">In recent months, Musk has often had more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery just starts.</seg>
<seg id="425">Musk now admits: of the 518,000 pre-orders, 63.000 have already been withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics repeatedly pointed out that it was merely non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">"" "in case of cancellation, Tesla pays the 1000 Euro (in the US $1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds)" "" "Reservation" "" "completely." ""</seg>
<seg id="428">At the moment 45,000 of such non-binding reservations are available, organized Musk in a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of so far about twelve percent of all orders could be a problem.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge with the ambitious growth targets is not in demand, but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">In 2018, all models will be taken together - 500,000 will be one million by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obviously there.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, 1,800 reservations are currently being made per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">Those who order a Model 3 today can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive his brand-new production lines never tested in practice without major interruptions with maximum capacity utilization.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>
<seg id="437">If there are any major delays, then the liability of reservations may become a problem for Tesla.</seg>

<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint that had been filed against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 Years of St. Hilary Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, 16 July at 4: 30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historic St. Hilarius plant a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Beneficent Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and promoters Tumlingens a concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stresses: "it is a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in a document in the Wuerttemberg script: count Hermann von Sulz sold the Berg with the parish church of Tumlingen together with the abbey "to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the document, on the hill of Tumlinger beside the former parish church there was also a beautiful courtyard, which belonged to the church or the right of patronage and not vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were people there too.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, it was next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still to be seen today in the village image of Tumlingen, the "mountain" the third, the manorial settlement of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps dating back to 1600 confirm this historical situation.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from early medieval church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church, equipped and occupied with a priest, remained the owner of this church and could also bequeath to this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">In this way, the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The size of the two shattered at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed over later during the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">During the Thirty Years' War (1616-1648), the window panes were engraved and the bell pieces were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops were encamped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used it as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church were threatened in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the church of Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the bell tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Night in 1834 a storm broke the church tower and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower still existing today was preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old history of the church.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallenberg and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are cultivating the Hilarius plant from the "sheep pensioners" as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">As a promoter, the friends and promoters invited Tumlingens to the old graveyard to St. Hilariuskapelle on Sunday, July 16th, to the sixth serenade.</seg>
<seg id="495">It is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with speeches by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">The suburb of Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4: 30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 3: 30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="499">At the end of the serenade, there is a trunk in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"" "" "" "enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest" "", "the organizers present fantastic views." ""</seg>
<seg id="501">The Serenade only takes place in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is of importance for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="503">The friends and promoters Tumblgens are particularly committed to their home care, as Serenade organiser Walter Martini reaffirms.</seg>

<seg id="506">"" "the" "" "Boisheim" "" "association has called on" "" "Land Council Andreas Coenen (CDU)" "" "to take back its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette." ""</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved at the Boisheimer Nette, as at the time in Viersen there existed only at the border to Schwalmtal a wind power concentration zone existed.</seg>
<seg id="509">Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones are intended to prevent "asparagment" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">The city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheim Nets a few days before, but the district government of Düsseldorf did not approve, because of a fault.</seg>
<seg id="512">"" "" "" "due to the lack of planning legal requirements, the granted approval decision is still unlawful and therefore also to take back," "" "said Christoph Erkens, president of" "" "Boisheim" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, is planning to build four each 200 meters high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">In the past year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, closed Pachttreaties with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the power requirement of around 11 400 households is to be met - this corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-legged households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersen's City Council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park Linnich near Aachen and a stake in a wind turbine plant in Übach-Palenberg in the district Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="532">In September, Bad Langensalaer and people from the region will rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="533">The commercial association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8th and 9th to lure the residents to the shopping spree into the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="534">As the Chairman of the Trade Association, Christian König, announced, the "Homeland Shoppen" weekend aims to sensitize customers to what offers their own city exerts apart from the usual supermarkets.</seg>
<seg id="535">According to this, a market with regional suppliers is planned, similar to the weekly market.</seg>
<seg id="536">In addition, domestic companies are to present themselves with their training places.</seg>

<seg id="543">Attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.</seg>
<seg id="544">In addition, customer potentials should be re-developed or re-opened.</seg>
<seg id="545">This includes spa guests and tourists.</seg>
<seg id="546">But also many local people would have lost sight of downtown shopping.</seg>
<seg id="547">In the end, everyone would have to contribute to invigorating the city centre - to landlords, the companies of the whole city and associations.</seg>
<seg id="548">It was necessary to overcome the lethargy with a network that partly widened, king had said in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="549">Birgit Streich, director of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, announced that five Thuringian cities are taking part in the country's third "home shopping" day.</seg>

<seg id="682">They work in their volunteer year in several places.</seg>
<seg id="683">Where everywhere?</seg>
<seg id="684">Quantity: normally in the furniture market in Steinfurt, once a week I will help in Greven in the furniture bridge.</seg>
<seg id="685">And I worked at school already in the open full day.</seg>
<seg id="686">What are your experiences with it?</seg>
<seg id="687">Quantity: it's a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.</seg>
<seg id="688">I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.</seg>
<seg id="689">They are now 26 years, so a late-called volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="690">How does that come about?</seg>
<seg id="691">Lot: I did a high school diploma.</seg>
<seg id="692">And then a civil engineer, let's say, successful aborted.</seg>
<seg id="693">I know for myself that it's the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else, work with people.</seg>
<seg id="694">And then I asked myself what do you do.</seg>
<seg id="695">Do a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it is, in the focal point, perhaps, really.</seg>
<seg id="696">And was it so?</seg>
<seg id="697">Quantity: I collected great impressions.</seg>
<seg id="698">I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester.</seg>
<seg id="699">I'm going to study dual, probably do a social worker training in Jugendamt Herne and studying at Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.</seg>
<seg id="700">Isn't it unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service?</seg>

<seg id="702">It always depends where you do your FSJ.</seg>
<seg id="703">It is possible to do it from the old people's home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.</seg>
<seg id="704">With me it was very varied.</seg>
<seg id="705">I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon care.</seg>
<seg id="706">For me it was just the right thing that irritated me.</seg>
<seg id="707">I could see my own strengths and see how it really works out.</seg>
<seg id="708">In other words than in civil engineering?</seg>
<seg id="709">Quantity: sure, here it's not about calculating statics.</seg>
<seg id="710">Again and again there are other people who have a whole different story behind them.</seg>
<seg id="711">Whether a refugee, whether a young person who has been taken out of the family - you always have to go into it individually.</seg>
<seg id="712">Very interesting.</seg>
<seg id="713">And you didn't have reservations?</seg>

<seg id="904">The works on the three bridges of the Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg are progressing well.</seg>
<seg id="905">On Wednesday, a seven-tonne concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="906">"we are very good at the time, it's great," says Reinhold Leicht, Head of the Department of Road Traffic and Traffic in the Regierungspräsidium Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="907">In April, the works began simultaneously on all three remediation bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="908">The construction site is scheduled for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule is being met.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads across the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is an arch-arch bridge made of concrete, covered with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 meters.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the two other bridges, it has now come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure stability and traffic safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.</seg>
<seg id="914">The two other bridges lead over the Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are made of red coloured sandstone.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 metres long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach on Wednesday morning got a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap on the north side.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a peripheral mount, which is also used as operating mode.</seg>
<seg id="919">On Friday, a 2.20-metre-wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway is supposed to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing about it is that these are finished parts, a patent by the Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">Particular finger-tip feeling has required the laying of lines through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">There is also a fibre-optic cable where many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">Local residents were informed about the project in advance of the work.</seg>
<seg id="926">In addition, fish and crayfish had to be fished at first.</seg>
<seg id="927">For the bridges between the building yard building and the collecting-house in the direction of Schramberg, the traffic is governed by a traffic light.</seg>
<seg id="928">"" "the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel" "" "Tannenhof" "" "and" "" "Seven Linden" "" "is fully closed for the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach village entrance." ""</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the financial rules of football affect Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenditures of the European football clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Spain to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come to Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, as the leading organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban crews from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules launched in 2011 by UEFA mean that PSG must prove that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to extract the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make the money loose for Neymar to sign it and bring it into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the energy rich ruling family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs must spend a lot of money for the purchase of players, but must be subject to legitimate revenue sources, which enable them break-even point in their football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs who had taken huge debts in their quest for success effectively deceive and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to the debts of clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, which Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a harder affair.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current 3-year FFP publishing period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has failed in 2015 by the Presidency, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to scare away from excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "surely FFP is not dead and we will surely reinforce the rules for the future," "" "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, over the Associated Press in the past week." ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the Buy-out clause from Neymar in a flat fee, it can distribute the amount for invoicing over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year agreement, so that the revenue figures for the next five years can be transferred to 44.4 million euros in the financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, owned by Manchester City, with the heaviest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">PSG received a fine of €60 million (at that time $82 million), which was later lowered to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 player.</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs trying to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenue from companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalan company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsoring was to exceed standard market rates, UEFA would not be considered legitimate incomes.</seg>
<seg id="1142">Exactly that happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsor of the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar via payments of the 2022 World Cup 2022 World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have contested that Neymar's World Cup ambassador is going to be and such a manoeuvre for UEFA regulators could be easy to figure out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">UEFA had no pre-preparatory talks with PSG via Neymars Transfer, said Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke about the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 has generated a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last financial year must still be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymars arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and tricot sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The Association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after its signature.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best footballers going to see, and she tried to prevent Neymars move by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"it's a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," said the president of the La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's last ownership of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American Sport Tycoon, shares the reservations of La League against a state financed by an association.</seg>

<seg id="1167">Industry insiders estimate the volume of orders according to "Northwestern Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves annual sales of approximately 1 billion Swiss francs.</seg>
<seg id="1168">But more important is the advertising effect: it is a prestigious order for a Schoeller manufacturer.</seg>
<seg id="1169">The Swiss company does not want to betray how many applicants hold the new tender.</seg>
<seg id="1170">But only Swiss manufacturers come into question.</seg>
<seg id="1171">According to the news report, Chocolat Frey wants to make an effort to renew the contract for spring 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1172">For the sda, the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not achievable for an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1173">Since 2006, the Swiss chocolate panels have been distributing the Swiss chocolate panels on board their flights.</seg>
<seg id="1174">Prior to the signing of a contract with the Migros subsidiary, Barry Callebaut developed the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.</seg>

<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.</seg>

<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The gracious Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Romanautor, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is another crazy evil plot, included in the Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good successful impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, the exams are the best part of franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It is especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons's sublippies of "Singles," whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old boy.</seg>
<seg id="1197">These are the moments of random delusion that could incite this franchise like a sort of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until it reaches that which I consider as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will show the band how to visit the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">In the meantime, "Comrade Detective" on Amazon also reminds us of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde" and even at "GLOW" with its East versus West ring fight iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka is to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth, atheism and the way of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hardened Gregory and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici, whose dialogues by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are synchronised in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It's a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it's not much more than an idea.</seg>

<seg id="1204">And the list of famous actors - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloha Sevigny - provides a decent play 'Find out the voice'.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is so much involved in the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a reagan mask - that it often plays like a single.</seg>

<seg id="1214">In addition, officials made large quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms as well as several hundred thousand euros.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Two people were arrested at the same time in Italy.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the Great Life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, moved from a large house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court Apartment in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne says.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I was looking for something comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with them and made an offer this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"" "" "" "I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light." ""</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi in Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the task.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not just about building a simple platform, but putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper-light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gilded furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in the addition of theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to let it work for a longer time.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirroring feels like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all cutlery and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering art went into it," explained Erfan from the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is important, so that when you push the door, it glides very easily." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the size of the floor." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the floor surface while using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things that you touch and that will help create an emotional bond in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you do not love the electrical outlets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">"" "these are important, but they don't play with your heart." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself into something quite amazing through a good design and increased square footage.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave this.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute because of one of the largest real estate markets in Victorias worth more than $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets should be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 real estate assets worth more than half a billion dollars, since the family purchased a business in Smith Street, Collingwood in 1973.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There the Westco family founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis's portfolio now includes offices in the city center, the Brunswick and Sorrento development areas, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping malls in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">After an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - by Paul as the "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - has about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">"" "" "" "a court file says that Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul worth 176 million dollars." ""</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "the divisions proposed by Colin have left him behind what I thought for the best objects," "" "he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers are now fighting for the control of the existing business - of which Colin, like Paul claims, has excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some of his possessions.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early Affidavit that was filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "my Italian inheritance writes that the family is the most important priority," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs increase in the case, with hundreds of pages with affiridavits, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and Law Firms held by both sides.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Ms. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They took advantage of the security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the first jeans shop of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on her property to her sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"" "" "" "Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land court," "" "she wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group, although Colin claims that Mark was paid $10 million when leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1379">"" "both Luke and Mark were," "" "Paul says about the conditions of their financial separation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin held back very much, although he was a former AFL member of the board and after a biography from the year 2015 by Eddie McGuire, he was the best friend of television stars.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"" "only Colin responded by SMS to say" "" "I can't say much," "" "because the case was in front of the courts." ""</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">"" "" "" "Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including the news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more smooth course." ""</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"" "" "" "when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior employees on his first day of work, he represented a major problem in President Donald Trump White House that he wanted to fix: poor information that was thrown into the hands of the president." ""</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "when candidate Trump was angry because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs that were too convincing," "" "said former election campaign consultant Sam Nunberg in February of Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keep trumps Twitter habit is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady lobbying." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "but the idea that trumps Twitter custom was ever" "" "under control" "" "is ridiculous." ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officers know something we don't know about others - that Trumps tweets would have contained even more combustibles without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his employees managed to keep him away from him several times, their efforts paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented it from provoking trump controversies.</seg>
<seg id="1406">One part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, are always trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advisors to bring dubious information to the president for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldsmith:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former platformer officials say that pumping like a volcano can react to negative press releases, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he tries to find out where they originate." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly this happened at the end of February when somebody accused the president of a printed copy of an article by Gotnews.com, the web site of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a pile of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banished from Twitter because of harassment or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has voiced false accusations in the past and has revoked it.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "Trump read the article and started asking staff about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">"" "Goldsmith added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the General Secretary of the White House, Rob Porter," "" "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork and document the dump." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly is trying three months later to do the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers still strive for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof due to the then ambience company gesellschaft mbH on April 13, 2014, some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also income by the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the fall of 2014, in view of the dramatic increase in numbers of refugees entering the county, the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation for controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a plan to secure the territory as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the Municipal Council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But especially Freudenstadt's Mayor, Julian Osswald, defended the hotel location and spoke of serious interested parties at the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">You will find Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1458">At the former Hotel Birkenhof, construction shuttles have been standing in front of the entrance for a longer period of time and when entering the house it becomes clear what extensive renovations are made.</seg>

<seg id="1468">One does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an upscale inner city level, Scherer emphasizes.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The Waldhotel Luise, with its 60 rooms, wants to set up wide, explains Scherer more.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Both individual vacationers, groups or business people should feel at ease in the hotel.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia Affair: US Special Investigator sets a Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have used a so-called Grand Jury in a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">In recent weeks, the panel has taken up the work, wrote the Wall Street Journal on appeal to persons familiar with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper saw the move as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN broadcaster reported that there were already first charges of the Gremium in connection with a meeting between the trumps of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin from interfering in the 2016 presidential election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller investigates whether there were agreements between the Trump Electoral Campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The investigation will focus on several men who acted as consultants of the Republicans in the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports Mueller took a closer look at more and more trumps of private and business environment.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote a few weeks ago that the special agent Trump personally came to the centre and asked whether the president could possibly hinder the judiciary in the course of the affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to examine present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to apply a charge.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand juries are therefore also called dock.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Most of the time, they are turned on when they are larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be switched on by the public prosecutor's office in order to invite people to interrogation under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to CNN, demonstrations have already been issued which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement, that was said in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr, Trump Consultants and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his former presidential rapporteur Paul Manafort were in the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the implementation shows that Mueller does not let himself be intimidated in his work and that if it should be necessary to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">However, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the charge of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">However, the establishment of the body is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for apprehension for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, on Thursday evening, the President uses a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents.</seg>

<seg id="1504">His special advisor, Ty Cobb, stated in a statement that he knew nothing of the substitution of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But this usually works in secret, he emphasised.</seg>
<seg id="1506">"" "the White House advocates any action that accelerated the work of the special agent in" "" "faire" "" "mode." ""</seg>
<seg id="1507">"" "" "" "the former FBI chief James Comey said three times that he was not determined against the president." ""</seg>
<seg id="1508">One has no reason to assume that something has changed, it was stated in the statement.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"" "" "" "because of this roundworm, accusations against Trump had become louder, he wanted to hinder the judiciary." ""</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June of a senate committee, Pump asked him to set up investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Following representation of US media, the White House gathered material against the Special Issuer and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation about whether a platformer would release Mueller.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent investigator of the Congress, such as the Watergate affair surrounding the later retired president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the behest of the President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>

<seg id="1525">In total, however, there has been a series of unusual breakdowns of ice-elites in the region for about 30 years, writes the US research centre for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a fact background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, global warming can be related.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus was so far a part of the Larsen-C ice shelf.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelhos floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It therefore grows further into the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelcows is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">To the north of this ice shelf the balance of waxes and breakdowns was disturbed several years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete horseshoe is broken down there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C ice shelf is in danger, because the front edge has never been pulled back as far as currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the iron plate stands under tension and can decay if a piece breaks down at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of ice shelf and iceberg does not increase sea level, as they float on the water and ice so much water as it results after melting.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, but only to a small extent, the British research project insists on the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C ice shelf is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural happening and is aware of no direct connection to climate change, the ice shield now comes to a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the broadest retreat since the beginning of the records," "" "he also confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists, whether the Larsen-C Schelcows would grow back or fall back in the long term and possibly collapsed, his colleague Adrian Luckman said: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Although these scientists do not trace the rupture of this giant iceberg to climate change, many glaciers of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long hem of the Antarctic stretches towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up around three degrees in the past 50 years and therefore counts to the areas where the temperature rises the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants Haustarif for staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it is becoming more and more difficult to fill vacant places, the CDU asks to step out of the employer's association to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Only shortly before the summer break, the circle day forked 41 new jobs in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1,100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 trainees have finished their first working day.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The teachers in the circle are obviously very sought-after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Some 620 applications were recorded for the places to be awarded this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the circle continues to lack staff in order to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Currently there are 50 non-occupied places in the Mettmann district.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, doctors and engineers, as well as forces of general administration, are sought.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In the circle-stag, the CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "according to the wishes of the parties, the administration should" "" "develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is not only to meet short-term requirements for skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented candidate shortage.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should be oriented both internally and externally, showing concrete measures for cross-entrants and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other towns advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "the speech is from a real" "" "competition of public employers" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the common application with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He unexpectedly took care of a fist-thick surprise when he publicly challenged staffing costs and startled the rest of the parties.</seg>
<seg id="1572">People want all possibilities to be checked, which allow a withdrawal from the communal employer association.</seg>
<seg id="1573">"" "" "" "if we don't come to a satisfying solution in the short term, the county administration should aim with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county-affiliated towns - a hoof tariff," "" "says Peoples." ""</seg>
<seg id="1574">In doing so, the CDU tries to pay better the employees and officials when it actually sees the tariff for the public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are at present exactly prescribed, increases or more money is available only if you change to a higher level which is oriented towards professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the Circle have grown more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitution Act.</seg>
<seg id="1578">Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, the Councillor Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy tightens the tone of NGO-migrants' lifeboats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"" "" "" "Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they must not continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations." ""</seg>

<seg id="1582">Minnitis Warning came one day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German aid organisation 'Youth Rettet' because their team effectively collaborated with traffickers in a way facilitating illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to express detailed allegations of the Italian citizen Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "for us, the salvation of human life is our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "" "said the organization in a statement on the social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "we can only assess all accusations currently being raised after we have gathered all the information and assess the situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat from 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is thought that its crew carries dinghy dinghy migrants, which are delivered to them directly by human traffickers, and that smugglers can depart, so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the records of the prosecutor, whose content was published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of overthrowing the authority of the Italian coast guard, the rescue operations in the area for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs, who are involved in search and rescue missions, have so far agreed to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>

<seg id="1604">In between there were still longer ascents, for the long trimmings rewarded.</seg>

<seg id="1613">Will the sports stars in future sit in front of computer consoles, instead of being sweaty at the speed of wind and weather?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact is: e-sport has long become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high fees included.</seg>
<seg id="1615">These have also recognized the first Federal Lists who are increasingly involved in this field.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and last the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sports division in mid-July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.</seg>

<seg id="1625">With high-profile e-athletes under contract, one could be more often present on these markets online than just send back to Asia once a year.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">For e-sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or just football-simulation play FIFA at a competitive level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">As in normal sports, leagues have long established, in which the professionals compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And in the Asian Games 2022, e-sport is already part of the official program.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a kind of sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the idea is certain to get used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobous also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions that you can also find in classic sports - for example increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">In addition, it requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and rapid response.</seg>

<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is declining because of the conditions reminding of drought and due to the diseases transmitted insects, which causes scientists and farmers who try to find solutions, great headaches are prepared.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, an expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence has been effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the life span of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small cichade, a micro-bacterium that transmits dwarf cicades, and in very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children into the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, Allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the payroll of the government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no respite from violence, and while the corpses are accumulating throughout the country, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has resigned in December 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter are their editors and their inspirer of Ridolce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," "" "Valdez said in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep even though his presence is everywhere - a great photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hanging on the facade of the Ridolce building. two reporters in the 1930s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical panama.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although an Attorney General's Attorney General was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, it has only launched two criminal proceedings under the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murders, each year associated with drug trafficking and organised crime, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to trial.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Ridolce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uncomforting and even though the terrain is even more treacherous.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting has little value for discussion of security, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know why, we all strust." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Ridolce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a couple of blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times he was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated with "twelfth river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter stopped in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest in the past year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, since rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "calm" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Ridolce, has broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First of all, in February the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This release may have annoyed the sons, presumed gangsters bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to not force Valdez to leave the country after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story to leave the country for its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the intoxicant problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to publish accurate investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the foundation of Ridolce, she received the prestigious Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize for her reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history wherever she led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He willingly admitted he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to continue living," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ award." ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life, "he said last October in an interview with Rompuviento-TV.</seg>
<seg id="1854">"" "" "" "you have to take over the task assigned to you as a journalist - either you or you play the dumb." ""</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what have you done in the face of so many dead... why did you not say what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Ridolce team miss Valdez, the fun bird, who was able to curtail like a dockworker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for routine his calamity?</seg>

<seg id="1863">"" "" "" "these things were not allowed," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells of wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">"" "the anger is, said the editor of the Ridolce Andres Villarreal that" "" "smell a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happened to Javier." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the staff of Ridolce met for safety training, there were suddenly no mobile phones allowed. days before it became known that Spyware, which was sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-size quarter of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who the governor was not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters have gone to the mountain scenery, where drug gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Ridolce has focused on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former well-known Boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an Exposé on state expenditures focused on the city's hometown.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels almost the whole century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-profile cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"" "Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of" "" "El Chapo" "" "Guzman escaped a military attack." ""</seg>

<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office became a storage room dedicated to characters and stickers that protest against the killings of journalists, because the employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to a demonstration in the morning for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">"" "in the whole country, journalists have become louder, having written in organized protests" "" "SOS Press" "" "on footpaths and buildings." ""</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for justice in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day following the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since asked for her to be re-divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">"" "Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were" "" "surrounded" "" "by organised crime, the government officials involved and an equivalent society." ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the command of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime.</seg>

<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk when he digged at the Suncor Millenium Mine on March 21, 2011 near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He hit something that seemed to be out of place by the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy earth clumping.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you just blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that these herbivores, although covered with an armor and resemble a changing tank, are probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as a counter-complaint, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed to get better into its surroundings and to avoid its enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million year-old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier made headlines in May and is now available at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing conservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the head of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter-shading is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs are hunted by enough pressure by eating dinosaurs, that evolution favoured the disguise of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the counter-shading - think of deer, zebras or shingles - are much smaller and vulnerable than prey, which signals that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "" "" "strong predatory behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur carnivores of the Cretaceous period must have been," "" "said Brown." ""</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also indicates that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to investigate the animal with evidence of his life, including his conserved intestinal content to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the bottom of the sea.</seg>

<seg id="1955">The Cretaceous period was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, who stood on two legs, crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and mumified in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn funk, when he digged at the Suncor Millenium Mine on March 21, 2011 near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the best armoured dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tops that raged from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored plant eater was washed by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the dinosaur's underwater cremation kept its armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are preserved so well that the houses of the houses still cover bumpy armored plates along the dinosaur.</seg>

<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document" what was happening.</seg>
<seg id="2060">One question was Ferrell in mind: "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?"</seg>

<seg id="2072">"" "two of the three founders of the movement, who after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 marked the film" "" "Blacklive Matter" "" "in social media, identify themselves as gay." ""</seg>

<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people even though they haven't been built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian precinct has been dividing the population into proponents and opponents since the first presentation of 2009.</seg>

<seg id="2094">While the proponents build that a gallery draws more customers into the city, of which the remaining businesses profit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian area will be bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the plot where the farmers market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This concludes with the start of the construction work.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda square with the possibility to sit outside.</seg>

<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I think that's superfluous.</seg>

<seg id="2109">You can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive at the top.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, shops in a shopping mall are only rented by larger firms, because the rents there are often not portable for a retailer.</seg>

<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping centre with a market hall doesn't fit together for me.</seg>

<seg id="2116">First of all: where should the farmers market hall go?</seg>

<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room at the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are to be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptibly identical - that hang on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and Haaretz, who were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year sentence after making public diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called a Becoming resemblance (matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and groundbreaking dissident, whose condemnation was transmuted by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Through algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, as someone with these genomic data could look like, a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual commentary not only to the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but openly talked about identification as a woman since puberty, was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">The prison was suppressed, so much that there was only one picture - a grainy, black-and-white Selfie, in which Manning clearly sits on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came just from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts, such as cigarette buttocks and chewing gum, by extracting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"" "" "" "they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "" "said Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition." ""</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal brides, which over the course of two years exchanged several letters.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a comic "Suppressed Images," illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the president would transform Overseas Judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas would be a welcome kind of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and strong, since Donald Trump is leading a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender forces to find new, tweetable ways to flare up the rigid splits he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a particular reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery Manning demanded with her oversized signature below (the "i" in her surname is sealed with a heart) an end to "automatic fragmentation, whose basis gender, race, sexuality and culture have been."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific encyclopaedia of the artist), as astonishingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take along is that our genome does not care who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2180">"we will finish the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Mutko</seg>
<seg id="2181">Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) are being implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti-doping agency (RUSADA).</seg>

<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of the timetable of WADA for complying with the code describing the criteria for re-setting RUSADA and recently published on the organization's website.</seg>
<seg id="2185">According to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.</seg>

<seg id="2187">"" "and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future," "" "he added." ""</seg>
<seg id="2188">One of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged publicly funded doping in Russian sports.</seg>
<seg id="2189">"" "in relation to the matter, Mutuko said:" "" "we carry out the investigation as our anti-doping system has made a mistake." ""</seg>

<seg id="2195">RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of doping controls in Russia in November 2015 as part of the Doping scandal of WADA.</seg>

<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your staff at your e-commerce start-up, but the polls didn't work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful, or worse - fraudulent.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="2208">She has called people from the outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is on the lookout to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement, it enables companies to address surveys, to offer specialist groups and demographic groups, to provide staff anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases whistleblowers allow to bypass the C-Suite Executives and contact the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"they now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for pursuing their health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City start-up GLINT, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said they have a better understanding of what your employees think and feel in the three years with GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap-around surveys and surveys of specific teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have most ailments and which managers have low approval results - so that you can rebog why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies are coming to see that they have to remain at the forefront of workplace culture so that you won't become the next Uber who has been involved in scandals, since a former employee published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment where those who have spoken have been punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like GLINT this wish for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The global governance, regulation and compliance sector could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, following the final technical website Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, who helps companies prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year amid the Uber-Falles in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Cent has nearly 600 clients including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently signed up as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">As GLINT, Convercent Enterprise lets you send tailor-made "pulse" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline, which allows employees to report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And when the Chief Executive Officer is involved, complaints proceed directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "public opinion condemns the regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, has employed Convercent for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of policy and procedures and an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">In the past, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often an intimidation and inconvenient experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now that the company uses Convercent, problems that were previously hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states have been identified and addressed more quickly than discrimination, harassment or unfair practices.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience with employment," "" "said Vitrano, who heads the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to take Ethics, Values and Employees Engagement in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "social media" "" "came to their right" "" "that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both GLINT and Convercent offer your software as a service and pollute the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that finds the approval of Venture Capital Investors who have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Cent received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with which the total capital was raised to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzers secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only bets.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"" "" "" "if people are happy to be in a company that is worth their votes and that the work you do is worthwhile, they feel more committed to making this company successful," "" "said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and GLINT." ""</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies are running well. companies run well when employees are committed and committed.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third-party promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement according to the experts in workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the caretakers of a company do not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Indeed, when a company asks staff for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not come quickly enough, or not at all, this can raise disappointments and demotify employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"" "" "" "if you ask about 4,000 suggestions, you must be willing to have 4,000 discussions," "" "said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen companies very well on collecting data." ""</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "for if you do not follow, associates wonder," "" "Have you really heard me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about it?</seg>
<seg id="2252">"" "and if you don't care, why should I?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now carries out monthly surveys, was able to take action on the same day if a problem is reported about GLINT, so saved.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after earning feedback from frustrated collaborators, it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">At Ruby Tuesday, the company gets more and more insights into the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this leads to better engagement of workers in a sector that is known for high turnover.</seg>

<seg id="2260">It's about 23: 00 when a lot of UCLA football players converse on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus.</seg>
<seg id="2261">Some have pulled out their jersey tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.</seg>
<seg id="2262">For a good part of the team, these idle minutes represent a lunch break.</seg>

<seg id="2266">Therefore, the first three sessions of the UCLA should start at 7: 15 pm to meet the already packed timetables of the players.</seg>
<seg id="2267">The compromise between the two days is more than a day when Bruins moved the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six playing times in Westwood practised practical exercises.</seg>

<seg id="2286">The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May, and Germany supports a plan for social media networks to be punished if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful posts as before the elections there in September.</seg>
<seg id="2287">On Thursday, Facebook commented in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts review was launched in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany.</seg>

<seg id="2290">Build a comic-novel: a castle in the history of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-s and 1980's.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his comfortable seat in the Irl River valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a fondness for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2294">"what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand."</seg>
<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England 'spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briy May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only responded to the thumb print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700's who worked for the Jacobins," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"" "" "" "this is his thumb print!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2299">And letters always smell of smoke; for at that time a fire was kindled for the light.</seg>

<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hybrid heads on the walls and bottles who had spent centuries in trenches.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He wandered through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape care, gardening and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">"" "then, at night he drank" "" "whiskey and began to write." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust received full access until 2006 when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" Oh, throw it on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the period of English Empires, maps showing who possessed what: "one could think that land conflicts would be boring," Rhodes says, "but there was a birch to fight the two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">"" "guys, let's go his way!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to plunge into the English history, among them 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a upheaval that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', says Rhodes.</seg>

<seg id="2313">"" "perhaps the two are connected?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as' The Priest ', which tells the story of the Jesuit patter, which the Darrell family had hidden for seven years during the English Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell was portrayed from the 18th century, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was excavated).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "the gentlemen seemed to be quite a fork, always making debts and spending money for things they could not afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by getting rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking guys, with a talent to recruit landowners. "</seg>

<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army, mostly because of alleged links to the movement of the Exile Preacher Fethullah Gülen that Erdogan sees as the wire drawing of the coup attempt.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should worry</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it won't be even more crazy in 2017, a new report will come about the technological developments in the field of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are at the moment a big deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and Co-Founder of FRR, we must start taking her ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will get them much more often," said Mr. Sharkey in the publication of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpandppen have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"" "the user can also" "" "adapt" "" "his robot according to his convictions and select everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails." ""</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it becomes even more disturbing since many robots have the" "" "personalities" "" "that would make a stepper woman look progressive." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sexpandals have developed to robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">For example, the RealBotix robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the features they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personages such as "Frigid Farrah" which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as good as possible to your personality," enthuses the website of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has her moods - quite like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, be fixed to conversation or she can be" "" "in mood" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female characteristics, the allusions to rape when one walks a step towards Frigid (i.e. here: reluctant) Farrah, disturb one the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxxy?" it is said on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toys.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their formation and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men, of course, will not keep sex robots, and while the FRR notes their growing popularity, they remain on the verge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what seeps out of the boundary zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time when women's rights are threatened all over the world, in which there is a president in the White House that has boasted to have women sexually assaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrible aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') is not the graphic images, the entwined body and the exposed eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (although with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their growers want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, brought to the point when it comes to their "personalities," the robots are not real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate or simply go away from their companion.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background history, nothing hinting independence or anything that could disturb the fantasy of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the Speech of 2017: maid</seg>
<seg id="2424">Pumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of healthy human understanding</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a rush of the platformer era that the political splits which polarized US voters have split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all allegedly strict ourselves to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of Trumps to bring together families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a leaning poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, anyone who knows them, including the republican relationship with which they had fought for decades for politics, suddenly and very especial on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">This is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but it is obvious to me that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the overwhelming effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "when we speak of" "" "normalization" "" "and" "" "dump" "", "we refer to the creepy possibility that his cat will no longer repel us one day." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans of the Right wing are "normalized," which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Nowadays I find myself covered by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's hilarious version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both in fact seem to be a very mild offense.</seg>
<seg id="2438">If Trump is going, the next candidate of the Republicans must be only spiritually healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels of the New York Parks Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need any caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormously large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are bulky and the animals twist to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely gloomy and the climate-perating music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city does not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the themed pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage counts not - but a large roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, the Central Park-carousel still has a strange magic experience, as two-year-old, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40-s can go to it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have assessed the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately nobody asked for it afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what actually should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store stood apologetically, while I was tired of the experience of submitting to her my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital</seg>
<seg id="2450">For the second time, Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year he was brought to the hospital due to the treatment of cuts to his wrists, according to the prison authorities, according to a case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistorius was sentenced to a first death belt because of murder after an appeal by the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013, firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he held his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder hiding in the cabin.</seg>

<seg id="2456">"" "" "" "the National Prosecution Authority said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection could be heard this year." ""</seg>

<seg id="2534">We make the city worth living</seg>
<seg id="2535">Roland Wacker, Haslach's city builder, will retire next year.</seg>
<seg id="2536">The position is already written - but suitable candidates are rare.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work still makes him great fun as he communicates in the press conference.</seg>
<seg id="2539">He reports of varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successors.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, it wonders that no application has yet to fulfil the requirements profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">So - considering the regular periods of notice - should be enough time for a familiarisation.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach functions as a Lower Structural Authority for the Administrative Community, the applicant must submit corresponding conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If they couldn't fill them out, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But the proximity to the citizens is important to the city and to it itself, says Wacker, who reports from a good working climate and a good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens.</seg>

<seg id="2559">"" "he is the builder," "" "in the end, everything here goes over my table." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2563">If you want to inherit Roland Wacker, after information from the town of Haslach, you should have a completed academic studies as a graduate engineer or a Bachelor's degree of architecture and have good expertise in the areas of construction and construction planning law.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may help to alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study is just the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition in the United States affects approximately 1.3 million and in the UK 300,000, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While those affected are usually advised to steer meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tryptophan protein contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells patrol in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">When the balance is too far toward inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, it has been found that a type of tolerance promoting immune cells occurs in mice carrying a specific bacterium in their bowels.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - a normal part of the gut microbiome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan encourage more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieu, if the same system also works with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral candidate, Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan, examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe that was separated from it had not.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiographies of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice's intestines were sequenced and six species found in mice with the immune cells were found, but without them missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were taken up in a sterile environment, so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this kind of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria spread on the immune system, the researchers led L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to unripe immune cells isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was cleaned from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan-metabolism, known as indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of the mice, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said:" "" "the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inside surface of the intestine." ""</seg>

<seg id="2676">At that time, in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg has taken over two thirds of the funding amount.</seg>
<seg id="2677">The subsidy was still 60 percent in the refurbishment area II from 2005 to 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, the previous refurbishments are a "success project" - it is ultimately important to promote interior development, and not only to open up new construction areas.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, the Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a refurbishment area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The funding amount was 833 333 Euro, of which 500,000 euros came from the country, the rest of the community felt.</seg>

<seg id="2687">The core of the program is the revitalisation of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and maintenance and expansion of the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="2688">The measures would be carried out object-related, that is, per plot.</seg>
<seg id="2689">The redevelopment area would eventually be defined as a statute.</seg>

<seg id="2692">In November or December, the statute shall be carried out as soon as possible so that the restructurings can begin next year.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann subsequently explained that each commune must carry out the said screening tests.</seg>

<seg id="2696">Pietzschmann will even come back to his feelings and take a picture of the situation, she promised.</seg>
<seg id="2697">Gotzel emphasized that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants.</seg>

<seg id="2718">The helicopter, made in Connecticut, was on display next to a yacht made of Maine, a Wisconsin fireman car and a Mississippi forklift truck.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed, a second team would be required for the return flight due to the restriction of the hours of service.</seg>

<seg id="2803">Cooking is continued outside the house: a caterer takes on this task and supplies freshly cooked.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The city runs 46 kindergartens in the Krefeld area, in 44 children get a hot meal at midday.</seg>

<seg id="2809">"the employees are assigned to a Kita," says Pommeranz.</seg>

<seg id="2820">This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm of the quality improvement of the kitchen performance as well as the charm, which it has turned out in the cost comparison between self-regulation and foreign assignment for the city as the most economical, it says from the press office.</seg>
<seg id="2821">And that, although 46 part-time forces are repositioned.</seg>

<seg id="2863">Did PSG Barcelona warn against Neymar three years ago?</seg>
<seg id="2864">The page of La League may regret their interest in Marco Verratti.</seg>
<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain will not leave Neymar in the pursuit of a £189 million offer to release its release clauses, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago in front of the record of the world record?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer, because the league 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United for 89 million pounds last season.</seg>
<seg id="2867">After completion, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest-paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of over 500,000 GBP per week.</seg>
<seg id="2868">Barcelona is furious about the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a spring near the Catalan Executive Board insists that the club always did its best to take care of him since his arrival in Santos in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2869">But was the football world warned against this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?</seg>
<seg id="2870">When Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="2871">"" "" "" "I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, we'll be in opposition to them, we will contact their players," "" "said Al-Khelaifi." ""</seg>

<seg id="2874">Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, whereby the Spanish association expressed interest in PSG central-field player Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.</seg>
<seg id="2875">PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel down under any circumstance, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offerings for Neymar.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen Report relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatz-Report on the misuse cases is relieved by Pope-Brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are the Church," declared after publication opposite the German Press Agency, as expected by the former Regensburg Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of Pope Benedict XVI, an apology.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret about their own omissions or their then false assessment of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">The Vatican Daily, "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand criticized that when reporting about violence in the Domspatzen, "double standards" were measured.</seg>
<seg id="2895">With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubt that it is "shameful and shameful acts" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation" is striking, such as the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria, Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, spoke with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "you're going to go to the church and that's a devoured face."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "she also pointed out that in her youth" "" "punches were a normal educational tool" "", "" "" "to deal with cheeky children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">It would be unfair to apply today's standards to past decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with reports on abuse cases, often pope-brother Georg Ratzinger appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "completely wrong, author and historian Michael hesemann, who wrote" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take refuge in Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with it," he evaluates the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is the 440-page report published by the Bishum Regensburg with the Enlightenment lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburg domains were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s, with high plausibility "victims of overtaking, 67 domes sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it is said about Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in conclusion, it can be said that Domkapellmeister R. generally used forms of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially in the case of high emotionality, punishment for the students could be even more severe.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "nevertheless, unlike many other defendants, many victims believe that many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even positive memories are linked to him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Ezekemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal involving the Regensburger Domspatzen, Georg Ratzinger, is relieved.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "incidents of violence on protective rights at the Regensburger Domspatzen" "" "is a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "for one, many students highlight his" "" "humanity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears as choleric and perfectionist, who became more tangible when a Domspatz musical didn't perform top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all present in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or co-operation in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the preschool were also expropriated outside of its sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">It is possible to reproach him at best, to know from it too late or to have taken first hints not seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the Domspatzengymnasium, in which he worked, was perceived by virtually all those interviewed as" "" "Redemption" "", "" "" "Heaven" "" "and" "" "better world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">In this way, the broad majority of Georg Ratzinger's students have a very excellent testimony, "sincere," "sincere," "honest," "competent," "honest," "competent" and "understanding," as extremely good-natured teacher, who regularly nourished the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy and "always surrounded by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotional appeal, which also led to flood outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he didn't just pop with chairs and threw the keychain on the floor, but also pulled the ears and too cheeky guys on the hair or ears, he admitted even years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for that.</seg>
<seg id="2921">However, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the early 1960s and 1970s, both in parents and in teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what it actually is about in this report, namely, the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the pre-school, these are certainly Bagatella.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it is not more likely to do with his fame and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media rushed straight to him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Many who have never understood him are still working diligently on the Bavarian pope.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report is relieved by Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, in connection with the report, a great deal was reported about the abuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger also accused of involvement in sexual abuse in the final report?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: no, no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claimed to have entrusted themselves to the cathedralâ s master.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to talk about it with my father or my mother," "" "said one of those affected," "" "It was all very embarrassing to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in educating sexual abuse was and is, however, that most of the victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a chorus leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators professionally.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen pupils judge Ratzinger's role with regard to the misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael hesemann: a questioned student put it in this way: "regarding sexual abuse... I do not see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... also for really absurd to assume that all of you... Buben have opened up more intrusive or more clear or even more, than against their parents, dormitory managers, trust teachers etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one talks about sex with him... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "in this way, the report concludes with the very clear result:" "" "the students and / or their environment entrusted to him in the run-up could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore exempted from any co-knowing.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So he cannot be accused of not being prevented or brought to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these disgusting crimes, as was unfortunately done in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media much of" "" "non-violence" "" "was to be read at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "looking away" "" "in the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem in reporting everything mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is precisely the misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is, namely, cleanly separated: between the pre-school and the Gymnasium of Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violent excesses as well as, let's say, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral conductors of the cathedral sparrows.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole horrible test pedagogy, the cases in which the boys of the sadistic teachers were properly harassed and malolerable and were horribly oppressed, all took place at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where there really had to be scandalous conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he had to face the boys only when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on that, as most witnesses stress, the subject" "" "pre-school" "" "taboo." ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">"" "one was only happy to escape from her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even" "" "paradise" "" "conditions." ""</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael hesemann: there was already discipline, but no sadistic power reigned.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" "" "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R." "", "and therefore in many cases even positive memories combined with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">So, at most, the reproach is to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970-71, when he began to establish himself and of the events at a school where he was not working and responsible, (as the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Georg Ratzinger consistently gave his ears to Georg Ratzinger?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report actually reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out this to" "" "that in the pre-school the test penalty will continue to be practised." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed when Prüfines were also banned in Bavaria long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they took place in a legal grey area, as each of us probably knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to estimate where the affected persons might be exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he would have looked away all the time.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That simply is not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">It was only in 1980 that the prison sentence at schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis argued that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael hesemann:" "" "we historians are talking about the" "" "trap of anachronism" "", "i.e. the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess was right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this is of course not true for sexual abuse, which was abhorrent at all times, and not for what was faded away in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond what was at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">It's all terrible and I'm glad that it's finally being worked up.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishing, i.e. slaying the ears and the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then banned, he also strictly adhered to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">What image of his Regensburger time did Georg Ratzinger play in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject test sentence also come into speech?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, i.e. Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, as the domes played only a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not by any means forget that he led a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this also has to be said: without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trang, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candy alone, one does not even make out of unruly boys a great singer and before any success, right in which field, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did Georg Ratzinger have experienced during the talks on their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I have met Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, basic, deep-believing and heart-good people, of whom one cannot imagine that even a fly could do something.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get in touch with him, like many former domes still today, 23 years after his retirement, regularly contact him, visit him, read it - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him until today, that he was once strict with them, are thus clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Today, most of the domains are thankful to him that he enriches their lives and brings the world of music to them.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but it was also a lovely respect, to which they still look up and revere them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once more clearly: all you submit to it are educational methods that were on the order of the day.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long ago overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is most unjust, a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intention behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report that has just been published relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the status quo, a 93-year-old man, who acquired great merits and without whom nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, would finally be in peace.</seg>
