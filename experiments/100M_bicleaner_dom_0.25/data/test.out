28 @-@ year @-@ old chef found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the stair@@ way of a local shopping mall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he could not imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , he went up with him again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ p@@ se found on Wednesday morning in West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 year old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , divided the medical department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and the investigations are underway .
brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , informed the ABS station K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a chef in Boston , had captured his dream job six months ago in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed on the ground &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time with Fran@@ ks family and friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gali@@ cia admitted that Frank initially lived in host@@ els , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things have finally gone up for him &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a friend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Louis Gali@@ cia said he could not imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly man with a great heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to combine his family with his family was to always cook something for us to prepare dinner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he never wanted to participate in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the stream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond , shining brigh@@ tly every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always plug@@ ged in
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston doesn &apos;t always have to be perfect or successful .
the Hollywood star has now clearly made it clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will always be stuck in drawers or stuck from outside labels that have little to do with me and reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , these things are more likely to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about the fact that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current Cos@@ m@@ opol@@ itan .
most of the time the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , in front of the TV with a loose de@@ br@@ is and Mexican food , she says in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the white blood , she asks the question of the child &apos;s wish : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film takes place on 25 August .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger and some colleagues looked for a bit of variety with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their evening , they drove home to the feeding trou@@ ghs in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p .
one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and thus the riding career ended again .
on Saturday Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer was all time - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses .
he had his family run over the complex of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even bo@@ ther for photographic purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and thus also with the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
in a small gala , the German Spor@@ ts@@ man handed over the Golden Sports Py@@ ramid to the man from An@@ hausen .
the symp@@ a@@ thetic sports@@ man does not lack awards .
Federal Cross of Mer@@ it , Silver Lau@@ rel leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the Queen Queen has already rebu@@ ked him .
long is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because she is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting the offspring .
and so he gave the prize money of 25.000 Euro as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ time US master winner was recorded in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the legendary Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the jum@@ per Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um the hand b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports legend came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company mig@@ rated to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza fee was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance from the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tr@@ ump Economic Policy Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investing in infrastructure and preventing the T@@ TP trade agreement - this is what Clinton and Tr@@ ump want . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two US presidential candidates , however , are un@@ aware of the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton are fundamentally based on a fundamentally philosophical difference .
of the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump desires to keep those in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wanted to tax the economy and regulate his death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will massi@@ vely reti@@ re regulations , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has to fulfil certain tasks , it has to open dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money for it .
that is why they would raise taxes for the rich , &quot; she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investing in that must be invested , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tr@@ ump and Clinton almost without word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the democratic candidate announces the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the state @-@ critical political party wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
so there might be party @-@ internal discussions on the dump .
the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pumping wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive coal mining in the US again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , the Paris climate protection agreement wants to termin@@ ate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , on the other hand , intends to explicitly expand the renewable energy with her investment program : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the Tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ fish trade agreement , do not want to sign them .
at the same time both do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs .
they should also be paid better , Clinton .
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a star@@ vation wage .
he wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump desires to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must r@@ ins@@ ed , then he says he must not be changed .
but the great discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens , is standing up to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics point out to him that the budget deficit would only be even greater .
on the other hand Clinton , who at least wants to ask the rich people to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every fled woman has experience with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is almost a part of everyday life for women who are fle@@ eing alone .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
there are four women sitting in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby at the most one year old .
one has laid her small son in her arms .
he looks curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the Executive Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor of social welfare services in Bavaria and deals with the issue of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are refugees .
in the north of Munich , they live in one of the few decentr@@ alized accommodation for single @-@ wing@@ ed women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs opened the facility together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Münchner Frauen@@ enh@@ ilfe .
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has experience on her escape experiences with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee for wars because they are persecuted politically because torture or death are threatening them or because their families send them as hope carriers to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; women out@@ weigh other reasons for their escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many secretly steal away from seeing no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honor killing , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this is what drives them away .
on the flight this continues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that tu@@ gs for example require a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who think that the end , as soon as they arrive in Germany , er@@ r , tells B@@ ahr .
here too , single women in refugee camps would often be considered inferior and ab@@ used at worst .
this means that approximately 90 per cent of women who live in the accommodation in the north of Munich are trau@@ mati@@ zed , appreci@@ ates them .
&quot; some of the children were certainly not made up voluntarily . &quot;
many women are so used to saying nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about what they experienced , because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know to help , there are more accommodations just for them , B@@ ahr demands .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question of whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction , some answered with no .
in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing in accommodations of governments .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia , fle@@ dged women are not accommodated apart , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , under@@ - and middle @-@ Fran@@ con@@ ia , there are in some community @-@ shel@@ tered floors or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , where there are two central accommodation exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it is said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is very important for men and women to be accommodated apart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the privacy is missing , or if men and women are accommodated together , it can become a perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the study shows that the washing rooms should be separately accessible and accessible for women .
how much women feel this need for protection can be read at the crowd that is on the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have spoken of being around , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily make a second house .
assistance doctors strike : demands for new work combat measures
assistant physicians have called for their union to appro@@ ve new work combat measures in their quar@@ rels regarding a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work combat measures from the beginning of September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the J@@ DC said it had been minist@@ ering ministers to address concerns about the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in July , assistant physicians and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the president of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; har@@ sh@@ ly quiet &quot; to problems , which led to the treaty being refused .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inde@@ ed , the J@@ DC board has agreed to completely reject the proposed new contract and demand official new negotiations on all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today issued a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council in order to appro@@ ve a running programme of escal@@ ating work combat measures starting at the beginning of September .
the quar@@ rels led to the fact that assistance doctors struck six times this year , the first overall failures in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A assistant physicians , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , res@@ ig@@ ned after the election to reject the agreed contract conditions recommended by the BM@@ A .
he divided the BM@@ A members during the meetings , which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 students and medical students , that the contract should be beneficial and should be accepted .
after the vote , the health minister Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the Treaty for Doc@@ tors in England would be forci@@ bly introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands and proclaim an official end of the eight months &quot; war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gil@@ ded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace , I can &apos;t resist the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
there was a hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile imp@@ acted ang@@ ri@@ ly , and he barely radi@@ ated warmth , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke repeatedly of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if something bad had never happened .
it seemed to me that his enthusiasm seemed to be the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ating , sustainable cows showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was kind@@ led .
Putin shared and accused Ankara of having fallen on the backs of Russia .
the offen@@ se was even greater as it was committed by a supposed friend .
to rebuild the ve@@ to will be difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months the state @-@ controlled media carried out a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything .
most serious were the alleg@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria areas controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he v@@ ehem@@ ently denied this .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
after all , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse that he wanted to hear from the President Erdo@@ gan .
Russia was able to make a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan first and foremost needs all the friends he can get after spending most of his time on a failed coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at last month .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late seasonal attack on the Mediterranean .
this week , the state TV predicted cheap fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian imports were allowed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti defined it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious to the West , as it re@@ acts its response to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak response .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is due to the persistent res@@ ent@@ ment about the EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is eager to benefit from the cool sen@@ timent and reduce Turkey &apos;s relation to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Ankara , the Russian state of state gained a bonus for claiming support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep fear of regime change .
the summit in this splendid palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present , as an analy@@ st once described , &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries that are viol@@ ating the West and feeling badly treated and now al@@ lied .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played a role as a peac@@ emaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial interviews both pres@@ idents were saying that they hadn &apos;t even gr@@ asp@@ ed the issue .
the president of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize them .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey ab@@ used the Russian military jet - it is certainly better that the two He@@ ads of State talk at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for customers outside of Scotland
according to the Board of Directors , the R@@ BS brand can only be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself since it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this time , br@@ anded strate@@ gi@@ sts called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to protect other end consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to put more national brands into focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all the RS@@ B references , the central headquarters and the stock exchange are changed to Nat@@ West .
the brand Ul@@ ster bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for the private client business that will get more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire during a sightseeing tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand of RS@@ B will become our investment brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed , as we will now become more of a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say now that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers among these brands .
R@@ BS has already stated that its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship will no longer continue and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s time for us to become a bank of brands , as how do we concentrate inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launched those brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches its 3.@@ 000@@ th profit at New@@ market on Pre@@ dile@@ ction
D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ys champagne after a double at New@@ market bringing him 3,@@ 000@@ th prize
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British gain at New@@ market on Friday .
he placed a milestone at Pre@@ dile@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey that reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ Dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won against G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar before , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori particip@@ ates in the jubil@@ ation when he brings victory to Pre@@ dile@@ ction
two jo@@ ckey &apos;s have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 wins in a record breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the ninth der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 car@@ eers
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern@@ ity and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone , which few have reached before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect that differenti@@ ates him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma fans have been enth@@ r@@ alled for many years for this sport .
I told Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already taken 6,000 gains if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already ri@@ dden almost 30 years in the UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an unbelievable jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying D@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the fi@@ gu@@ re@@ head of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
a whole series of major tournaments including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; in 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug prohibition .
three years ago , he had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive character in order to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and to return to his best form .
and he hasn &apos;t come to an end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue in competitions up to at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of age .

Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who , since 2012 , was Ivan@@ ov@@ s &apos;s deputy , was named his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital of Tall@@ inn , he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy .
on the Krem@@ lin website it says ( in Russian ) that he later was the protocol chef and staff leader of the government staff .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the government &apos;s main task to support your work as head of state with respect to bills and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin told the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivan@@ ov had asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
do the smiling faces convince ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
for a long time , Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was one of the closest collabor@@ ators Vladimir Putin and worked as he did for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
during a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ ig@@ ned at his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , few are convinced - especially now , shortly before the parliamentary elections .
so is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at the moment .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once tou@@ ted as a potential president - would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin cited on the Krem@@ lin website , Ivan@@ ov said : &quot; it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - to entr@@ ust plac@@ eable posts for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the State Security Service ( K@@ GB ) .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was president of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was named his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov one of five people whom he most trusted .
it was once believed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia , as a third term Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another close allies of Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became prime minister , before being elected president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical confrontation on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series announced in a joint statement its termination .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the announcement of his dis@@ miss@@ al on Thursday .
on the set there were artistic differences and differences of opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the character Gib@@ sons of the series , which follows a team of F@@ BI agents , is expected to be published at a later date , according to the opinion of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played at the Sit@@ com D@@ har@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , was with us since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and spent my entire lif@@ eb@@ lo@@ od over the past twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was hoping to be there until the end , but that will not be possible anymore .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can wish for a series .
the scheduled broadcast of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for 28 September .
ri@@ ddle about fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a villa@@ in of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that 75 fish might be dealing with sandals , which have been sp@@ iced out by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives approx . 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ ferry crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the North deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the vi@@ a@@ duct - meaning the bridge is now connected with Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closing of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 be@@ vel ropes .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all the witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ a@@ duct and the bridge deck is a delicate operation requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit .
in total , nearly 79 % of the entire deck deck is in place , and the last section of the deck today gets a concrete casting for the deck in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , project manager at For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first lock represents a significant milestone for each bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fantastic project represents the closure of forward @-@ looking high and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the street and its connection with the north tower in the expansion , we had to close the still existing gap on the north or land side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive because the vi@@ a@@ duct is 2@@ 22 meters long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % .
delicate as the tolerances on which the team works are tiny - on each side , they ru@@ de only a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately , everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown from their fishing boat to Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI ba@@ il@@ out station suggested an alarm on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat moved from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and imagined the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds have blown the boat out of reach until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a bu@@ o@@ y without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water were lucky and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had an emergency stop , but it loos@@ ened the boat from the person who ste@@ ered the boat .
someone has watched over these men today .
seriously injured - man stab@@ bed his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked and severely injured his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife .
as the police ha@@ sten@@ ed yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had got the key to the apartment to pick up his personal stuff .
instead , the alcoholic perpetr@@ ator cut off the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when she came into the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice .
the 44 year old was injured by the hand and the body .
the police could arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called on his mother .
this then al@@ erts his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her partner .
on the road , she met the husband &apos;s ex @-@ wife .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who is building favorable flats in Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens say : investors should be taken much stronger in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose nearly 1300 affordable homes over the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; room for action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next council session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
first and foremost , the question is : who is supposed to build affordable housing ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group President Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : whoever wants to build on urban areas must have 20 percent of all apartments in the form of social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cheap apartments , however , can also arise in the continu@@ ance .
the major issue in the town hall is , however , as Brat@@ mann says : &quot; how to deal with investors who want to build on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such surfaces but as much as 20 per cent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban residential development programme , which will cost millions and still needs to be financed , should provide incentives for incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few rules as possible .
the left wants even harder constraints for investors .
no matter what , so Brat@@ mann , a sharpen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market .
if the concept of action is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get skilled workers .
but the programme is not yet complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how to compensate for the loss of more than 1,@@ 300 affordable housing , whose promotion will exp@@ ire in the coming years ?
by 2020 , there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , so the plan@@ ing politi@@ cian Nicole Palm , should now buy pending connections from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought about bringing apartments back into price loyalty .
this is possible in the western city .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
for in the western city , deadlines are exp@@ iring at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments could be taken back to the price ceiling for cheap apartments .
only : this does not want the owners , the housing corporations .
because the number of social housing in the western city is drastically increased again , the goal of the so @-@ called thorou@@ gh@@ fare is to be removed .
there should be no more concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged people in just a few parts of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens are counting on the fact that there is still movement in the discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go on board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although I concentrated on more construction sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise can not yet be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it
it &apos;s fascinating to see how the world is changing .
the fact that teenagers and children don &apos;t go out to play outside , but rather prefer to spend their free time playing on screens has been lam@@ ented by many in the last decade .
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to TV , then on video games and finally limited to smartphones .
it is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
of course I refer to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s ( later created a series of carto@@ ons , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
like many pop culture phenomena , interest in the release of the game decreased in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July .
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that the server over@@ loaded .
within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and nearly as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ mon that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and , once they are found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( using a screen@@ shot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the ma@@ dness and jump@@ ed into the search of the sofa .
in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person re@@ stores each day .
Cardi@@ o@@ grams , an app for Apple Watch , which pursu@@ es 35@@ ,000 users , informed the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of tra@@ cked people , who train every day 30 minutes , jump@@ ed from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who is playing Pok@@ é@@ mon go - it only sees raw data to increase performance .
many public awareness campaigns for the health that people want to take for 30 minutes , &quot; coming from the sofa &quot; and &quot; being active every day &quot; hit deaf ears because many public messages are boring for health and come from people who look mis@@ erable .
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ valued .
those who regularly exercise sport reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoor that makes them fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even make new friends on the hunt .
as usual , there are also angry game spo@@ ilers that have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could walk around a door .
what &apos;s it ?
a breakthrough occurred .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit could already track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sports as this game does .
the new will lose its appeal and use will fade in time .
however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active will in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier .

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es Cre@@ ates Gold in the Dam@@ age
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all that .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
brilliant throughout the whole line .
and now finally also Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast drow@@ ned on Thursday for the championship title and magni@@ fied the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her overall score of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American woman Sim@@ one Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the Swedish bar during the single multi @-@ fight of women in the gymn@@ as@@ tics of the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympics , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who wins a multi @-@ fight title and overall the fifth , while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her end result was shown and her long journey was ending at that moment .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years , 15 world cup med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u ba@@ il@@ out said she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
she expected a final exam in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered a disappointment .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace themselves after winning gold and silver in the single multi @-@ fight in@@ ale of women in the gymn@@ as@@ tics of the Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as an ex@@ clamation mark on the farewell celebration of the retired team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted on having never planned the future during their long journey , it is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - containing their typical tum@@ bling pass - is adapted to Latin American music , which would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
this girl adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child and trained by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans dam during a school excursion into the gym , trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , it has not lost a competitive competition , a winning series that will continue as long as Bil@@ es wishes .
even if Must@@ af@@ ina slightly led through two turns , the picture blur@@ red .
floating beams and ground anten@@ nas - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - was l@@ ur@@ king .
she resum@@ ed with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor still one on it .
Ra@@ is@@ man sof@@ tly hu@@ gged her as she expected her bro@@ therhood - a pure form@@ ality - and tears flo@@ cked on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her book book , became reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Must@@ afa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; grand@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the Americans , had a lead . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her floor exercises , she threw out K@@ us@@ sh@@ alls , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as far as Bil@@ es is concerned , the twe@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims of mass mur@@ der@@ ous crime shot in the car listening to music
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot , who died in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first mur@@ der@@ ous attack by Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and listened to music .
Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12th , while the car was par@@ ked in an entrance , the authorities said .
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a fire@@ arm while he stood on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police informed that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder did not seem to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y rob@@ ber@@ y since the aggres@@ sor did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 that were in possession of one of the adult victims .
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they are associated with four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in nine attacks and two injured in his@@ panic living areas within four months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is happening in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS at the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting that aimed at an empty truck truck half an hour before the triple murder and that it was assumed that it was the serial killer &apos;s work .
investig@@ ators found bul@@ let shells and secured a ball out of the seat as well as spher@@ ical fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it gets better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and , of course , his mother .
but like least of his contem@@ por@@ aries , Ed@@ mund Fre@@ ep@@ hal@@ ie , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy .
when he came home for the first time , my first thought was that I could not .
I don &apos;t manage that .
I didn &apos;t let myself in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s not right at all -- of course , you got into it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and you have been told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer to that was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a subsi@@ dy .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l up to his third year of life and he can still not speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund has conceived for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing me something &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we teach him sign language , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund invented several characters on her own .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a large number of causes : genetic as in Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and pre@@ dictions can vary greatly .
it &apos;s still too early to say how it will affect the life that will affect the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still does not really know .
I have not asked for a pro@@ g@@ nosis since a long time , because I don &apos;t expect them to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rainf@@ alls , floods cause ba@@ il@@ out in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ alls and large floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call on the emergency department on Friday . it is expected the whole Saturday with more rainf@@ alls .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flooded its banks and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , the National Weather Service reported .
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards announced that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on their way to the municipalities concerned .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that alone the community of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa claimed tens of thousands of sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used for large parts in southern Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather forecast announced that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood @-@ early warning system was used on Friday , while it still ra@@ ined in the Mobile area .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will all probability reach record levels over the weekend .
met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many homes in the area near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a downstream floo@@ ding in Ascension P@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers will only flow slowly into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as over the beaten rivers .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi national border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.@@ 00 .
rescue teams still ski@@ pped people from flood water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y H@@ ans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were rescu@@ ed near Glo@@ ster on Friday .
H@@ ans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally located more than 400 feet from his house , greatly increased overnight .
he said that another step@@ son who lives near him would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water flo@@ ated and poured in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ ans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife told H@@ ans@@ ford that in the 48 years she lived there , she had never seen such a high level of the river .
H@@ ans@@ ford said he and his family members had all the disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ fer had saved all three in a large military truck and would have brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they stayed until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said the flood had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spread out quickly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities considered evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer expressed in the proximity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the rainf@@ all has been significantly improved since Wednesday .
the authorities indicated that heavy rainf@@ alls and road floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and lessons in five bor@@ ou@@ ghs .
the WW@@ L C@@ BS subsidiary reported that a co @-@ ordin@@ ate in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa ob@@ serves 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated into two churches which now both were flooded .
the leader of the commune of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities would have rescu@@ ed 72 people and seven domestic animals washed by floods .
in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the evacu@@ ees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will be able to return to their homes again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of streets were closed due to the flood and sand@@ bags were provided for the residents who hope to keep the water out of their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last major floo@@ ding we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his statements , a handful of houses were reported to be flooded on Thursday , but there were no reports on Friday .
Keith Tow@@ n@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tow@@ n@@ son said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s still coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , pier@@ ced by bul@@ lets , &quot; survived shooting in Philadelphia
the police announced that the 6 year old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child was shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several injuries including the loin , leg , arm and abdom@@ en , but that he was in the hospital when he was transported .
&quot; he has gone through a lot , his small body was pier@@ ced by bul@@ lets , &quot; he shared his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter .
I simply cannot believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy told the station that he is likely to recover again .
he should have started the first class at a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 year old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical condition , shot at , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating if one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ator .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that apparently it had come to a cross@@ fire between multiple sho@@ ot@@ ers .
pat@@ ron@@ age sleeves for assault rif@@ les , which were traced back to various assault rif@@ les , over@@ saw the crime scene .
it seems that this is clearly an ongoing struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , there were seals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so there seem to have been several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the Police in Philadelphia to the station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
several houses and vehicles were also found in the area .
there was no arrest and police are currently re@@ viewing the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a j@@ ag@@ ger on the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .
she reco@@ vers and the police still looks for a suspect .
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I imagine in the gymn@@ asi@@ um of women in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that for more than one reason .
first , I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 , and the USA has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three gymn@@ asts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which inspired many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jewish is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is ca@@ tho@@ lic , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and his@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one among female female female female female designers was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year were Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic med@@ alist and America che@@ ered .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world champion Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they provided unexpected , yet master@@ ful gy@@ nec@@ tic routines .
on Thursday , Sim@@ one was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American , who won gold in an individual event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but we do not see gymn@@ as@@ tics all over the country .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie were all beating the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to make it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympics will only have four female gymn@@ asts . it is also the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that gymn@@ as@@ tics are an expensive sport and Tur@@ ner first line in private gymn@@ as@@ tics that are maintained by parents who pay for the training , furnishing , travel , and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their Tur@@ ner and families ) . the list can be continued arbitr@@ arily .
the majority of these gymn@@ as@@ tics lie in prosper@@ ous suburbs that can support the business .
in these clubs the gymn@@ asts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment for the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained her athletes since they started gymn@@ as@@ tics .
we have to offer to the assemblies of innum@@ erable young girls , inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easily accessible gym training .
I founded my gymn@@ as@@ tics foundation 20 years ago .
during my events , we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban teenagers ( mainly black and his@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics that will make the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that motiv@@ ates thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of Girl Power by holding the Olympic team golf and thank you for motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistant physicians want to organise further strikes after they have rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 assistance doctors who voted for a vote rejected him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in July Hun@@ t had unveiled plans to introduce the Treaty and said that the N@@ HS was in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No Man &apos;s Country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first assistance doctors are to receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekend fees to improve the maintenance of scheduled times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , President of the BM@@ A Committee for Assistant General , announced last night in a communication with : &quot; assistance doctors have still serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat up the current staff crisis and arrange it to treat all doctors . &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out .
efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to resolve disputes with the government on reluct@@ ance to take part and at times de@@ af@@ ening silence .
that was what Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had made last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now to lift up the condition and address the concerns of the assistance doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do so , the assistance doctors have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work combat measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to provide coverage for doctors on the strike chain .
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants a better week pay for the 5@@ 4.000 assistance physicians who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of N@@ HS employees , urged the assistance doctors to end the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; combat measures achieve nothing but little , but already stress over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients , nur@@ ses and their families only concerns , need and interruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months , we talked to the committee of assistance doctors and responded positively to the concerns regarding the guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ing with the ministry of health and other mini@@ stries .
employers hoped that continued positive commitment to other key topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training for those who return from a vocational training , training ch@@ ests , mutual recognition of the curriculum , continuing education holidays and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day medication that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication after being advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti @-@ inflammatory medicine T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , thereby reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
about 140@@ ,000 people have a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form floor@@ ings .
when the covering breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that block the flow of blood to the heart and thereby cause a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots dissolve , it can flow through the blood stream and block the flow of blood to the brain , causing a stroke .
people who had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more unlikely .
the introduc@@ tory draft of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Center , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on a person &apos;s quality of life .
experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have had a heart attack .
with a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness culture lets electoral fraud flour@@ ish in Muslim areas
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year for the release of a government report due to corruption from the office
a culture of political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities know@@ ingly ignored as an anni@@ hil@@ ating government report today revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Cab@@ inet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally attacks the police , election ob@@ servers and town coun@@ cils to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Minister for Integration and Municipal Government , who is now an antagon@@ ist king , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of poll@@ ing cabins to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should take a passport to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present a vot@@ er only needs to name his name and address .
the report suggests that non @-@ removable ink can be applied to a person &apos;s finger when they leave their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice .
whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only for electoral fraud , but also serves to protect the local government against the broader corruption and financial fraud that accompanies it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was ordered from Dow@@ ning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets election sc@@ andal in eastern London .
last year , a special court ruled that the inc@@ umbent mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was to be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
the court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in cy@@ ni@@ cal ways , and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation where one person chooses to be someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country .
he expressed in particular al@@ arm@@ ingly to the frau@@ dul@@ ent choice of letters - with the older members of the Muslim community putting pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including guiding styles to prove identity
in his report it says : &quot; as proof has been attached that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , especially communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions would have know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said 50 Recommen@@ dations to clean the system , including the ban that political activists deal with letter selection material to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ ap electoral &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral list being used for immigration and social security purposes .
consider options to ask voters prior to choosing your ID .
un@@ removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice .
systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to make sure they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation to requests for an automatic letter selection .
ban that political activists deal with full post @-@ election sel@@ ections and envel@@ opes .
the police have the power to set up lock@@ outs for electoral stations .
a change of law , which facilitates an indictment for in@@ timi@@ dation in line with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( the Leg@@ isl@@ ative Assembly 1983 ) .
prohibition of photograph@@ ing in elec@@ tive stations .
requirement that only English may be used in the electoral stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the employees usually enforce that voters go alone to the voting booth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric notices the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case there was no criminal complaint . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral district has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his substitute for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices un@@ suitable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons he was found guilty - in accordance with the high requirements in criminal proceedings - guilty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check@@ ups &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the election registration departments of the city halls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets from the last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country bears a proud heritage as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy after K@@ ate Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous doubles of Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio will be amazed by the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , who has proven to be an impressive double @-@ vo@@ ke of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ on@@ kin is by no means the only ath@@ lete struggling for gold this summer , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not if one is allowed to believe the social media .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ cker on our screens at the moment , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic Games that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US squ@@ ad Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , on the left , has been compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since childhood
besides K@@ ate Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the cycling track , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher could be the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the US squ@@ ad Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has created a storm on Twitter after pictures on which he looks very similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the ar@@ cher received the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he has already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I myself don &apos;t see any great resem@@ b@@ lance , with the exception of facial hair , &quot; Bra@@ dy informed the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good @-@ looking guy , so I guess it &apos;s a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa , with her large expressive eyes , is supposed to be a Doppel@@ gän@@ ger for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
a step higher : this user believes that Nathan is an &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor
another lasting comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ wig , who shows similarly severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal winner Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mo@@ va shows more than just the sun @-@ tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while American Nathan Adrian has been att@@ ested by fans to resem@@ ble an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , on the right , have a similar face and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities
theory into space : according to this user there might be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the pair
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons included Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ ns Gab@@ by Douglas , who has her own beautiful , wide smile that resembles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers died &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds &apos;s analysis of the fourth place of the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Yan@@ is at dr . 200m free @-@ style swimming staff@@ el shocked spectators of the C@@ BC live transmission of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ ical games on Wednesday
Canadian television station C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; like M@@ ief went off &quot; and during the race like &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was switched off when he saw his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 100m free @-@ style swimming staff@@ el .
Mac@@ Donald , who was brought on board in the commentary team of the C@@ BS to give more colour , could be said : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , Baby . &quot;
too excited , went away as M@@ ief , died like a pig .
thank you for that .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ai Yan@@ ash@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , making it possible for Canadi@@ ans to close the gap to China .
viewers in all Canada re@@ acted quickly after they were shocked by the sound and the language
&quot; &quot; &quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ as the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old float from China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a pig died ? ? ? ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot has not broken that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai Yan@@ is from China was described in the final 4 x 200m free @-@ style swimming staff@@ el for women as follows : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , Baby . &quot;
the criticism of By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came fast and hard , in which many presented him
Twitter users did not return when they heard how in@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let us look like ra@@ cists . # asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a short time later Scott Rus@@ sell , who hosted the C@@ BC program , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment on swimming performance was broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times with people who responded to the B@@ emer@@ kt on Twitter
the commentary store Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ olog@@ ise in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to over 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yesterday night we quickly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers on the show and our followers in the social media .
to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments referred to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not to them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ happy formulation . By@@ ron does what he said very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the show and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention to be interpreted as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s swimming staff@@ el at the C@@ BC Olymp@@ ism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am referring to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not to them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pri@@ mark purch@@ as@@ ers indign@@ ant about woman who sham@@ elessly tries to under@@ wear in the middle of the business
the buyers didn &apos;t know where to go when a woman pulled her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mark to try under@@ pants .
to make the situation worse , she looked like she looked at it , pulled her out and put her back on the shelf .
she continued to rum@@ mage and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a store at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Mall in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark store at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman propag@@ ated the pants before putting her back on the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear &quot; she went back and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales floor she took a pair of pants out of the delivery , pulled off her own ti@@ ghts and pants and tried them .
&quot; she did not even try to find a dis@@ crete place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the pants which you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put them back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three more under@@ pants before she finally decided that she liked nothing , went back and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to bo@@ ther saying that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who might buy the pants which she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Davi@@ dson , 33 living in K@@ ent , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How strange to think someone would take shelter that had a different person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees have tried to draw the clothes from the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had them and pulled out and they were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that happened on Tuesday , 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products in question have been withdrawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself against weapons attacks with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
we spoke to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Con@@ federation in New York , to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from the rear , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer for your pre@@ dat@@ or .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when you approach you from behind , you should turn around first so that you can see your aggres@@ sor and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go out of the line , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
then hit him with the knee in the gro@@ in and twist while the attack@@ er cur@@ es up from pain , the weapon out of his hands . strike him with the barrel and move backwards as they strai@@ gh@@ ten up the gun on him .
with attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the gun and twist them so that the attack@@ er cannot shoot .
at the same time , shift the weight to the weapon and beat the Att@@ acker to the chest , then turn the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and set the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it pre@@ ys Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that in a rob@@ ber@@ y it is saf@@ est to hand over your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
travel@@ er Ian W@@ right sch@@ ab@@ t for a guide his tongue at the dir@@ ti@@ est places of Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ took his immune system and lit@@ ters of a serious test by le@@ aking up some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the present@@ er and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k played his course on a euro note , a ban@@ ister at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a rinse button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before the lick off of each object he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he is getting involved .
but the experiment , which was made into film under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight .
the idea to lick off the flus@@ hing button of a train toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right talked with doctors and medical professionals about promoting intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately , nothing left behind what he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in his mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his bow@@ els by travelling through the world and ate strange and wonderful things .
from public rail@@ roads to railway stations to flush @-@ but@@ ton@@ ing toilets , the task presented its immune system definitely below a sample
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film he was able to do justice to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his sample painting showed a lumin@@ ometric rating of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the lumin@@ ometric number of fresh washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to lick off after her lumin@@ ometric rating was over 4000 units while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 .
Mr. W@@ right and Finnish producer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that comes close to the worst that I have dug in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more con@@ cious than that !
I will not lick it here because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the extraction of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; vali@@ os senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biotics .
we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended up saying &quot; Let us call Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I told him to lick , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others , with whom this was rather difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty le@@ aks on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o from 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents associated lac@@ tic acid bacteria especially associated with the well @-@ being of ga@@ stri@@ c and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they should at least occasionally use products containing attached lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
A@@ soci@@ family destro@@ ys social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left their social housing after a dele@@ tion with a damage in the amount of £ 50,000 because it had terr@@ orized its neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ ati@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after being forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls were filled with holes , wooden plan@@ ks were torn up , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated to the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that they are now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ vo@@ y , who works for the house management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for people and I think people don &apos;t have to live this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider since this property is probably considered as not so beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is likewise .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted on street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive cries , disputes and floods .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house which will be torn down under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden plan@@ ks were pil@@ ed up
neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and regularly calling the police
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ o@@ gi@@ erte she and her partner forci@@ bly off the estate this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw .
the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ans were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbors who said their lives were made hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t care for anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived next to them for 20 years and it was always terrible .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this morning we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now that they are finally gone , it will become beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said it would have taken the family to cooperate with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house , to which the police were called in regular intervals , 20 years
rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down on the over@@ grown site of the church building .
he added : &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant should arrange to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family , as del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation is always the last step to consider Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing .
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be horrible .
I appreciate all the work done by my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and provided us with the information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after Del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung on the floor
workers of house@@ keeping will now have to evacu@@ ate garbage mountains that surround the house
in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine , after having found guilty to the owner of a drug of class B in commercial recognition .
she claimed that the money was a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
having been homeless , it is assumed that T@@ anya and its partners now live in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many room walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say that they will del@@ o@@ ge rent@@ ers who do not abide by the house rules
Angela C@@ row spoke of the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall that the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think that they can behave without self @-@ reproach and those who were har@@ med by such behavior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists in Portugal panic after an eff@@ ec@@ tual military jet flies on the beach
sun worshi@@ ppers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
a portu@@ guese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on Air@@ plane of Air Force placed an incredible dive
the air strikes reported that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that there was no safety risk
this was the moment when frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after a ti@@ ph@@ er jet crash over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military plane flew close to the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers jump@@ ed up when they understand@@ ably started to worry about the noise of the keys without seeing what came to them through the clouds .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many tourists who posted videos about the dramatic F@@ ly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew very deep twice , and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the airplane dropped on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly low .
the Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats in front of the coast and so had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the speaker said the jet flew somewhat deeper than usual due to the poor visibility due to the poor visibility conditions , but the air strikes persi@@ sted that safety was at no time at risk .
this summer , land fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland , in which four people also came to death on Madeira Island .
the Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of the circumstances - heavy fog and smoke , which restricted his view .
the airplane was on a training flight , where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca wor@@ rying about Sev@@ ille
Sev@@ ille - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first title in the new football season on Sunday .
the Catal@@ ans compete against FC Sevilla in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup , the back @-@ back rises three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ W@@ inner has to do without N@@ ey@@ mar in the match with the defeated Cup@@ fin@@ alist and reign@@ ing European league champion , who den@@ ies the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
also Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen is missing .
the German suffered a change in the knee in the training , with which the ser@@ mons at Bar@@ ca at least initially clari@@ fied in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen in Barcelona have been competing for the status as number one for two years .
in this respect , coach Luis En@@ rique refra@@ ined from making a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most of the other competitions takes preced@@ ence .
before the first obligatory play of the new season there is doubt about the fitness level of the team , who was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 .
also at 3 : 2 in Pro@@ men@@ al@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co . did not really convince .
Sev@@ ille , on the other hand , has to di@@ gest the 2 : 3 defeat in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
with so far , Barcelona is the record winner in this competition .
Ma Long in its own league of table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow country@@ man and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the world @-@ ranking @-@ first ranked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ als Tournam@@ ent and the Olympics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bronze passed to the Japanese J@@ un Mi@@ zu@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the title among themselves .
so it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese on top of the Olympia Stadium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between sets and time outs , they didn &apos;t have a coach .
they had moved back to the grand@@ stand and left their guns on their own in fair competition alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the matches to here I played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game , gold and silver med@@ alists participated with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
Ma had really to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first sentence .
then he set the tempo to the top and left Z@@ hang as only a total of 13 points .
through the superi@@ ority of Ma did not develop the expected stirring match .
nevertheless , nevertheless , there were sufficiently stunning b@@ ale changes to be seen .
Mi@@ zut@@ ani won the game of bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ov 4 : 1 .
in his quarter final round against the German champion , Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the White @-@ Russian had himself drawn into a rib@@ bed injury , after that in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to be satisfied with sheet metal .
the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) had become Olympia @-@ Fourth in similar high table tennis .
Donald Tr@@ ump ad@@ mits &quot; massive problems &quot; in the election campaign
the leadership of the US Repub@@ lic@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditionally conservative states , losing their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has now highlighted the weaknesses of his election campaign in the so @-@ called repub@@ li@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the multi @-@ lane and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ ary expressed something like concerns , as reported correspon@@ dents .
after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the own Republi@@ can camp from the race , there are now doubts about his success in the struggle for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump to evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
blame is false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media group .
repub@@ li@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds are shaking
U@@ tah is normally a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
according to a survey conducted by the surv@@ ey@@ or in June , Tr@@ ump and his rival from the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , were alike .
other institutes see Tr@@ ump in the front , but not by far the distance that is common to repub@@ li@@ can candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered .
in an interview by Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump answered the question as to how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and whether afterwards : this will be either successful or I will make a very nice long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he makes no difference as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; telling the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if for him in the end , for reasons of political correctness , it is not rich , be it in order , said Tr@@ ump .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party should have threatened to cut funds to support his election campaign , he should not present any better surveys .
instead , the Repub@@ lic@@ ans &quot; candidates for Congress would be stronger than the arms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Olympics : tri@@ ster fraud in dop@@ ing test &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary committee .
Ken@@ yan athletes threatened the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro .
following a fraud test at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya has sent a trainer home .
the International Olympic Committee announced that it would immediately set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary announced that the former S@@ printer and present coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , entered a urine test in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich .
this was reported to the team leader K@@ eni@@ as from dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF World Federation has requested the IO@@ C to obtain information about the case in order to ex@@ ert its own investigations , an IA@@ AF spokes@@ man announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the study and the following measures of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will evaluate an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the IA@@ AF . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the D@@ oping control station and spent himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , handed over and signed the test , &quot; said K@@ eni@@ as chief de mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the accreditation of the ath@@ lete , who stood on the list for the training controls of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich has become World Cup fourth in Beijing in 2015 over 800 meters .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan Ath@@ le@@ tics He@@ ads of He@@ ads Michael Rot@@ ich were deduc@@ ted from the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed athletes of his country about upcoming dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he was said to have been arrested on his return to Nairobi airport .
in Kenya , after numerous dop@@ ing procedures , Kenya has been under special observation for some time .
at the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , it was previously noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
the World Anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympics begin .
as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya has taken from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is regarded as a great runner nation .
the athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of TV reports of the ARD , alleg@@ ations have repeatedly been made that in Kenya D@@ oping resources are easily accessible and there should be a significant ment@@ ality of sports fraud .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently requested a similar investigation in Kenya as he had hired her in Russian athle@@ tics .
in this sport , it was possible to prove that this type of sport was sur@@ fac@@ t@@ ally and systematically dop@@ ed .
as a result , Russia &apos;s athletes were excluded from the summer games .
the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ Year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic romantic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece .
the artistic director of Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with Mary &apos;s role as a youth room .
in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we have Bernstein &apos;s music really in our blood !
in this production Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she re@@ members melanch@@ oly to her boy@@ friend with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
firstly because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then there would be Maria &apos;s personality .
she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so she is wise , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is very similar to me , my Italian character , whom I have as Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is such an honor for us to work with her .
it is an immen@@ sely generous person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
one sees it in each of his movements , in his gaze , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , that is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece is about prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have the refugees , back then the d@@ olls have gone to New York , and the New Yor@@ kers did not want them .
these are the same subjects , and today they are as meaningful as at that time .
59 years later this piece is still relevant .
London school girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria .
Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e &apos;s lawyer said that her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria a few weeks ago .
it was suspected that they were killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the stron@@ gh@@ old of the group in the country , I@@ TV News reported on Thursday .
sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she pre@@ tended to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can only hope that the only good is there - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with entering a war zone - stopping people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other school@@ girls from the east of London got into a plane in the direction of Turkey , followed by a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tana &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months .
Rei@@ d says Clinton will remain in the case of electoral victory in Gar@@ land as candidates for the Supreme Court
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the Pres@@ i@@ dency candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate Ju@@ dge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked gar@@ lands confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the late judge at the Supreme Court of Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Rei@@ d on Thursday during a telephone conference calling from Clinton to select Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said he had not yet talked to Clinton whether she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated .
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not care for rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the supreme judge for the U.S. Court of Appe@@ al for the District of Columbia .
RAID said Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the lands nom@@ ination were lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of Republi@@ can presidential candidates Donald Tr@@ ump .
he also noted that Donald Tr@@ ump is un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tre@@ ats wants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women and Men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazin works with photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mers to bring out a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked humans , they would like to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 .
the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine differs from Old@@ school play@@ boys as &quot; Play@@ boy for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he believes that it does the Calendar too .
&quot; we need to return to the depic@@ tion of timeless and classic n@@ ak@@ edness , in which both women and men feel well and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release for the publication of the cal@@ endar@@ s .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a wonderful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally at open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community reck@@ ons with mass flight
&quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t suit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kur@@ dist@@ an Community of Germany reck@@ ons on short notice with tens of thousands of prot@@ esters who escape from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , it could even become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the president of the Association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
following the coup attempt by Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; at the short notice , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with some hundreds of thousands of prot@@ esters from Turkey in Germany , if Erdoğan &apos;s Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government had already over@@ subscri@@ bed Kurdish blast @-@ bur@@ sts several months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds were fle@@ eing Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the beg@@ gar@@ ly put@@ sch , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks were added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to restart in Europe if they are further oppressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that internally absor@@ bs refugees is producing refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief of the association lam@@ ented the deliber@@ ate settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities .
as a result , Erdo@@ gan wants to raise the exit pressure to the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradi@@ cated or expelled in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief of the Association called for the Federal Government to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in Germany there is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks are seeking asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the brand @-@ marking as Gü@@ len @-@ trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever does not suit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , inci@@ dentally also the Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ul@@ ari@@ sts , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ minent Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as reported by the paper with reference to the numbers of the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks had already constituted the largest group of asylum seekers recognised for political persecution in Germany before the coup .
as of June 30 , this was 11.@@ 3@@ 86 people and therefore almost 29 percent of all recognised as asylum @-@ seekers ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
this survey does not cover the face of war , poverty or lack of prospects .
asylum rights according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the natives do not get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
in 2021 the state election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
because more stupid than so far it is not : summer holidays , heat and land election campaign - that is bit@@ ing .
the locals , who are supposed to be convinced by the election fighters , are on holiday .
most of the holi@@ day@@ makers in the country , on the way to U@@ se@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not natives , so you can &apos;t choose the country day .
there are some practical problems : during the holidays there are hel@@ pers , hang up posters , infl@@ ate air ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers , and end up voices in the end .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign just close to the people .
the hot phase , if you can say it at all , just started .
and it is also something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in poll@@ s .
how much newcom@@ er Af@@ D will cut off and what remains in the end of the coalition will be exciting .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from his big posters .
he travels across the country , distri@@ butes roses and ch@@ ats a bit with the people , just as his legendary ancest@@ or Harald Ring@@ storff also did .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , Seel@@ ering got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the development of the Af@@ D . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ha@@ sten@@ ed the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U , with its peak @-@ edge candidates , the Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ er Interior Minister , has already experienced what it is like to make electoral campaigns at the right place at the wrong time .
she has invited English chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale demonstrations ; Merkel &apos;s polar circle is located in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; compla@@ ined Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in N@@ DR .
but it &apos;s a shame not to listen to Angela Merkel once again from other corners of Germany .
otherwise , the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U ren@@ oun@@ ces largely the usual election campaign conditions at market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means co@@ king , playing only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also the Union has noticed that in the country you are crum@@ bling the base that it must be very strict again to find a wire to the people .
it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : hardly present in the expan@@ se of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the CD@@ U sel@@ ector co@@ king to his comrades is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must go where it hur@@ ts , namely where the people are : village festivals , golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called on its SPD to become a particularly committed campaign .
in poll@@ s , the Socialists and Democrats were at least 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just in front of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the 2011 election , the SPD won still clearly with 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , the small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , should make the leap into the land day .
they make a modern virtue out of their holidays and transfer their campaign largely to the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it calls the country president Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , green voters go on their way to search for local voters in search of local voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , just cur@@ v@@ red with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg Lake and finds it even beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 Ren@@ ov@@ ation : catering facilities suffer from block@@ age
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated .
there are lots of praise for those responsible for the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and only end at about 8@@ pm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have made everything quite sha@@ ky , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff of the jet petrol station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super team .
there is no delay .
the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything will be ready .
the opposite is also praised by those responsible for the construction works , for example when it comes to the furnishing of accommodation facilities .
since the construction site moved to the south on Monday and also the locking of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ fan@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and therefore the connection to Rot@@ tenburg has been restored , the traffic situation within the place has been relaxed .
the citizens can now travel from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ev@@ asion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the place seems to go back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there have been some considerable problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Deputy Director , Florian King , responsible for the management of the refurb@@ ishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ el@@ strasse , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ strasse , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ eping paths were looking for and more familiar to their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ age .
what led to the introduction of some trucks in residential areas .
since the speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the community also called for the measurement vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; there were significant exc@@ uses , &quot; says King , who made himself aware of the situation .
two to three per minute have been las@@ hed .
the fastest was with 77 hours per hour in the speed @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has moved on , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg the street is open again .
business@@ men don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 refurb@@ ishment has led to a sharp increase in sales will allow everyone to look through .
however , some are more and some are less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. produced for other companies , have hardly any consequences for the renovation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sul@@ z also speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at most slight decline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , but also acknow@@ le@@ dges that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drive shaft is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most vulnerable are the restaurants along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crowned , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential threat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have hit it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil .
we have to be happy about every Euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he estimates the revenue losses to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far above 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road renovation took its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back for two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
half of his employees have to be dismissed .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from G@@ öh@@ ner whether there could be a financial compensation , with the hint that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 . now it must also bear the disadvantages arising from the renovation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where something more generous has been handled .
in all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , refers to the long history .
that other regul@@ ars now look less frequently due to complicated traffic management , he can understand .
if you can &apos;t drive , it is also somewhere else beautiful .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt that his family @-@ client@@ ele comes back after the end of the renovation work .
despite the crisis with BSE and avi@@ an influ@@ enza , G@@ öh@@ ner maintains the impact of the B 27 construction work on its client@@ ele for the biggest crisis that its restaurant has experienced in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , that &apos;s brutal .
the fight against terrorism is constantly being scre@@ ened in the name of fighting terrorism .
after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère now suggests a thick security package .
but what has a status of blame with terror to do ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Recon@@ c@@ iler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t claim anybody .
other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I also took part in it .
however , as Minister of the Interior , he was at the outcome of a &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; within the Coalition .
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had a little time left before he presented his conclusions for security in the Republic .
but these are all the more extensive .
some are already known , announced , announced : that a new security agency should take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU guidelines on air passenger data and weapons law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second attempt for proposals that had not been made with the SPD so far : he wants to recru@@ it sympathy for terrorist groups and kno@@ ck ji@@ ha@@ dis with dual citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acknow@@ le@@ dges the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still considers this to be reasonable and doesn &apos;t demand anything that doesn &apos;t have any chance at the coalition partner anyway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few new ideas also present de Mai@@ zi@@ ère . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have partly in themselves : he plans fast procedures for deport@@ ations and more opportunities for det@@ ain@@ ing people from deportation .
refugees who are pur@@ pos@@ efully retri@@ eved in the country should check their smartphones in advance and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
in case of d@@ ul@@ ties for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some even worse than before - for example those who commit crimes or deliberately om@@ it their papers to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of these are politically and legally hei@@ gh@@ tened .
some of them are still un@@ balanced and open to questions .
and at some points - in un@@ equal treatment of patient for example - the question arises : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in view of the high numbers of refugees , many people also worried about security .
and things that people deeply employed did not let themselves be cli@@ cked out in election campaign times .
the inner security has moved enormously .
first the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are electoral campaigns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Union and SPD are therefore increasingly in a position on the subject of inner security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent days between the two parties it went up high .
only a gar@@ gling argument about the equipment of the Federal Police , then about a security policy collection of some EU interior ministers , in which the departments also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from dual citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère we@@ eps himself here for conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
he doesn &apos;t think of a departure from a double pass .
we have established the discussion in Germany .
re@@ aring them is not meaningful .
and he has constitutional obj@@ ections with a Bur@@ ka ban .
whether his own package at all corners is un@@ constitutional and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ist , it is still necessary to show himself .
there is a lot in it , which could cause controversy .
but the SPD is also trying to gain a footh@@ old on the topic of inner security .
party Chief Sig@@ mar Gabriel cau@@ ti@@ ously sign@@ alizes the willingness to talk and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot;
Volkswagen is still going through a lim@@ p .
despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , delivery numbers are rising worldwide .
but not all markets are running smoothly .
in the recall action there is vor@@ tex around a term .
Volkswagen starts the second half of the year in the event of deliveries .
in spite of its many brands and some well running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can continue to boast a plus in the course of the year .
but in July , the core brand VW weakened mainly in Western Europe and thus again loaded the total sale , as the company noted in the D@@ ax .
in July , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , the second most important market in China , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s level .
in the home market Germany , deliveries declined by almost one sixth .
sales CEO Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann pushed the weaker figures out of July less than two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have given a reluct@@ ance to buy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on withdrawal from the EU also addressed a spokesperson .
in the USA , where the exhaust gas industry first escal@@ ated , a minus is also available .
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the primarily affected home brand of the Lower Saxony is further wor@@ sen@@ ing by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only a drop down of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles is available .
group sales manager Fred Kap@@ pler was able to advance sales spl@@ its from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5.@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had tam@@ pered with a software exhaust test .
in Germany alone VW is calling some 2.5 million vehicles to retro@@ fit into the workshops .
in the course of retro@@ fitting VW confirms that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine output .
after the change@@ over , the car maker will issue a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but do not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was stated on Friday in business circles .
reason being legal sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now provides its German customers with a guarantee of retro@@ fitted diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday .
from the Ministry of Transport it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fully met the requirements of my Commission of In@@ quiry and the KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deviations from this are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has assumed the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power , no deterior@@ ations will take place after the conversion and all type @-@ approved vehicle values remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was called in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example , customers may come to a workshop for example half a year after the conversion - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in customer interest , it is important to avoid that in case of any other damage that has nothing to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leak@@ age sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; there will be uncertainty with respect to possible warranty regulations as it was called . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why VW does not use the term &quot; warranty . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands pen@@ alties from rich savers in future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; chief Executive Officer Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposit or day money accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German B@@ anks talks about a single case and does not see it as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savers need &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not have to worry about paying pen@@ alties for their austerity measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if banks spend money on the European Central Bank ( ECB ) overnight , they have to pay its 0.4 percent pen@@ alties .
this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund to withdraw from private and corporate customers for deposits over € 100,000 in cash or day money accounts from September onwards .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year , &quot; Paul said .
for some time , he be@@ ware of 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day to another and which he could not exploit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Head of the Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lay down for every million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter pays principle , the costs now continue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; leaving the cash in the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Bank v@@ aults would be too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chief Financial Officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most customers would have understanding and changed to other forms of investment .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association of Bavaria stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy causes considerable costs for all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to bear them alone is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically un@@ sustainable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks therefore have increased their account management fees , credit cards or bank transfers .
the Thur@@ in@@ gian Volks@@ ge- und Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 made head@@ lines with penalty interest for deposits of three million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Chief Executive Officer of the Banking Union , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide charges for deposits , so the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said , at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a client@@ ele that is endow@@ ed with a wealth of opul@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it boun@@ ties free of charge . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cooperative association of Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is currently no other bank known to charge a payout percentage for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said speaker Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Federal Association of German Volks@@ banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen B@@ anks ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go to the negative is very , very high . &quot;

destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
sol@@ itary middle aged men love records .
before you rush to the comment section to see him under the pseu@@ don@@ ym Non@@ Alle@@ En@@ vel@@ en@@ Male Middle @-@ old with harsh insul@@ ts , this statement deri@@ ves from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the frequently discussed revival of records is not based on a boom in millenni@@ als , who want to welcome the news of physical objects , but rather to Mid@@ life @-@ nostal@@ gia .
for those who bought a record recently , all for@@ esi@@ ght is between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
it is also not a hor@@ des of hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers hold their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog is a news report on TV , the camera would follow me as I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , wear a modest gray suit and step@@ pe wild@@ ly before I stand , hold my hands and say something better : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there still is a handful of fantastic record specialist shops .
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glas@@ gow , 55 I of Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of data : two young women , three middle aged men ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of data : eight middle @-@ aged men , one woman , probably around 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I already appreciate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have about 3,000 or 4.000 albums .
these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , dress up the walls of his living room .
the reason he has such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his disposable income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford than they appeared and buy items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late six@@ ties , early se@@ ven@@ ties that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought were too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend time alone , and add : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink a lot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers he meets can apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and have been forced to buy their old records again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the conversations that I have led , people usually dischar@@ ged themselves so around 1998 or 1999 of their collection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the supposed emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offer a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z some of the older customers accepted the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar record sleeves , of items that wake up happy gem memories .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; says WE@@ Z .
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it is an easy way to mentally engage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an employee fle@@ es from a record stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey conducted by the IC@@ M in April revealed that nearly 50 % of people who bought a record last month had not yet heard them .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player whom they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record have no record player .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned as I smoo@@ ther through a pile of Bos@@ sa nov@@ a comp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three middle aged men ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the revival .
&quot; someone came up here recently and said , &quot; I don &apos;t own record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound plate so I can put it on the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it happens definitely .
more productive , less music @-@ like .
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones who come in slowly .
F@@ op@@ p , which has devoted almost an entire floor to the records , has a lower audience than I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and middle aged women .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts latest syn@@ thesizer and sex@@ ier pop , instead of experimental jazz dr@@ um@@ bles from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks very lonely , but serious mental trau@@ mas are hard to det@@ ach when standing next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the store for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale .
it makes a window @-@ shopping rather than a wholesale purchase .
it does not deserve much , therefore collecting records is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to hear music from a computer or other way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; it drives away with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the impression to mu@@ stering jeans pants , I observe a group of young teen@@ age girls who are group@@ ed around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a Cros@@ ley record player .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of records from Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody sees them - maybe because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates .
although my research revealed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v are right , they , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , have not taken into account the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record stores and online forums .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they certainly do not spend their Thursday morning stro@@ lling through sheet stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while avoiding the star@@ chy gaze of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false Moder@@ ator who raises no clu@@ eless middle @-@ aged men over the shoulders .

French Court re@@ jects offer about demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the Cal@@ ais jungle in which thousands of refugees live .
during a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argue that the state should be allowed to submit 72 temporary shops where people within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , sell hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy out of which no taxes would be paid and which contain a fire and san@@ itation risk .
humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported associations and other groups would not offer enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also led to the fact that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille ruled that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 temporary shops , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that the grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely feeding people who &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the tear@@ ing was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café , which is operated in a non @-@ profit way and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 170@@ ,000 people signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that closure was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children of a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two relief organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants were estimated on Friday that the number of thousands of people living in the jungle had risen to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number up to now - after a steep increase in new arri@@ vals during the summer .
despite the Olympic disappointment : Martin remains comb@@ ative
despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing performance in the Olympic era , Rad@@ prof@@ i Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to let slip .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I keep looking at the World Cup , remain confident and fight further , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not have an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place at the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hon@@ estly find it difficult to comment on the past of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must analyze in peace which reasons would have led to de@@ bac@@ le .
at the World@@ watch World Cup in October in Qatar Martin actually wanted to fight for the title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll look at everything we &apos;ve changed in the last time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this includes my position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the three @-@ time World Champion , who lost more than three minutes on Wednesday at the Olympic Champion Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to focus on the next generation of speed meters : in different federal states , including in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash units are being tested , which should be particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement trailer of Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at accident areas , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , at highway construction sites or to build bridges with temporary speed limits , there is often no need for infrastructure to ensure compliance with speed limits with a stationary speed heater .
but a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days during continuous measurement operation , the case data are transmitted encrypted over a modem .
with laser measuring technology , all vehicles can also be captured over several tracks at the same time .
variable speed limits as well as drive @-@ through b@@ ans according to time , lane and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art state , the trailer can be moved with each car with trailer hit@@ ch according to the manufacturer .
so that it is not simply st@@ owed , it is lowered in the measurement mode , so that the wheels disappear in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way also a bul@@ ky outer cover .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the cameras from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to specifications of Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .
foreign authorities also flash with the new technique : recently France has ordered 100 units , following an order of 150 units last year .
Britain gets silver in 7 @-@ er rug@@ by after Fi@@ ji brings Master@@ class Gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at the 7 @-@ er rug@@ by race led to an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the Fi@@ j@@ is form on Thursday evening when they were defeated at the De@@ odor@@ o Stadium in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 .
Fi@@ ji shared a master class in handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , back @-@ back , line running and raw power to win Gold - her first Olympic medal in any color .
the defeat was missed by the not too bad price of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back to it in the final .
but regardless of that , Fi@@ ji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in this form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Brit@@ on tomorrow will hang a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , the former head for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago , under R@@ yan , they lost every game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they just lost one .
this hat@@ ch will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji started wonderful and let the attacks drop G@@ Bs out of fun .
it felt for the captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. on as if one would run in running buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 upwards when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au ech@@ o@@ ed in the corner .
with another four minutes of playing , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner .
12 @-@ 0 and GB has hardly embra@@ ced the ball .
a sne@@ ak@@ y T@@ ackle from Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of man Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third gate , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute , j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a found a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new member and there was still a minute of playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ breath@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u tor@@ tured by further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it is as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while the UK still star@@ es .
this is the way it is .
GB carried out basic modifications at half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for about four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through after a brilliant play by Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Sea Sul@@ ph@@ ans , whose fans sang , flags wave and danced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame placed the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last few seconds .
the P@@ fi@@ ff sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and the UK ki@@ cked down in the lawn .
earlier on the day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated in the semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pushed South Africa into a scar@@ ce semi @-@ fin@@ als match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks forward in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton interrupted the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate under the post in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by battle with the trainer &apos;s cancer for a ru@@ dder victory
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ esque gold than with these games , and that &apos;s what they mean .
from the first strokes to the last , 220 hard p@@ ieve who went into history Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in her golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only those who were sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the response of the coach Robin Williams was present when she ru@@ ed to the second Olympic old in the second without a tax woman in a row , the first women in the history of British sport that laid such a benchmark .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , their 3@@ 9.@@ ter unused disposition , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant female athletes , gli@@ ding over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the type of triumph in its entirety .
behind every gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make up the difference and nobody was more helpful than the coach who did not know 30 months ago whether he would survive this day at all than he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that was what they did .
if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a bit of the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , which kept the interruption to a minimum if that is the right term at all .
I needed money , so I had to get better again soon .
it was an incentive .
I was hospit@@ alized and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it begins .
rowing in itself is a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of the victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ stri@@ ped tomorrow with something more than just talking and trying to handle his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ anning , who was a Captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . that &apos;s something extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked for .
it was three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , therefore a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person to train or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning did not lose a race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 metres , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to stop , p@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very trapped in the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not prepared to make something great .
we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race whatever we did .
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about its future .
globe must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV @-@ advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exemplary for clarity for 31 years
the managing director of the &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe &quot; water @-@ purpose association , Rup@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , is reti@@ ring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is considered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemplary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Frank@@ ish drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for the large water producers .
some time ago it was said in the original sound in a post by the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
little later , the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia praised the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the v@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far as exemplary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , who was 31 years in the Zw@@ eck@@ verband für Emplo@@ ye@@ es , stands for 28 years as managing director .
he was now retired at the age of 65 .
the water @-@ water @-@ association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brun@@ n , transports approx . 150@@ ,000 cubic meters of water annually and provides 32 places and hamlet with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member churches are the municipalities of Kirch@@ sheim , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are also water supply contracts for other towns and communities .
the current chair@@ woman , Breit@@ brun@@ n Bürger@@ master Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler was set up as a water go@@ al@@ keeper in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from the installation and maintenance work on office and organizational activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emer@@ gen@@ cies on weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an outstanding event , she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the re@@ purchase of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the re@@ purchase of water pipes .
there was no stand@@ still , and there was always something new added because water was the most important food for drinking water and drinking water .
in their lau@@ dation , she commen@@ ded Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service over the age of 31 .
he used a lot of lif@@ eb@@ lo@@ od for his water @-@ purpose association and he really lived the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group to the nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district .
for that he received a great deal of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , for his part , praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water@@ man and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
from his point of view , he described Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the restructuring of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult task , however , were the rup@@ ture of the pipe at the elevated tank at Kirch@@ icious on January 3rd .
we had to work here at minus 17 degrees all night so that the towns could be supplied with water .
the supply of new brun@@ n can also be maintained once only because it filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .

&quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a . &quot;

but the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago is well ahead and now learn privately in New York , where the best therapists are there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example : when I ask him something two years ago when I sang at La Scala , he re@@ members nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot;

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - Men shoot at partner
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at his partner in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( Stor@@ mar@@ n County ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45@@ am and injured her mort@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called himself with us and declared his partner to be shot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , after him will be public prosec@@ uted .
meanwhile , Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1.80 m tall , muscular , brown @-@ baked and has a lat@@ ch .
meanwhile the police published a photo of him .
it is , however , a couple of years old .
meanwhile the man has a bald head .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon , so the police .
those who see Sven S. should call the 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship at hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 and the perpetr@@ ator 1981 .
the competent police in Lü@@ beck did not want to give any information about the departure or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims ; however , she confirmed that a human being had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not say more at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special case command ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime .
steel - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ laden and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed of additional costs in millions of millions .
financial burdens that the industry threatened from green electricity production are from the table .
it remains in the release of the renewable energy conversion in the existing plants for so @-@ called self @-@ current production in the German steel industry , &quot; said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday Edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really glad that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel told the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators are replaced in steel plants , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent is required .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but even this will not be raised in the steel industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission to produce electricity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way the status quo of the previous regulation is largely fixed .
Gabriel &apos;s successful efforts for the steel industry have particular significance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel is the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others must follow &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of the emissions trading scheme , climate and employment targets are to be weighed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IG Metall @-@ boss Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has suffered from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis of 2008 .
last year , the situation wor@@ sen@@ ed further , when the world &apos;s largest producer of products in China threw massive steel onto the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers acc@@ use Chinese steel companies to dump@@ ing price dump@@ ing .
in the course of this spring the situation has somewhat relaxed .
on the one hand , the import duties have an impact on import steel . on the other hand , economic prospects in China have brigh@@ tened up .
it is unclear how sustain@@ ably the price recovery is .
German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , the prices would have stagn@@ ated again .
the industry re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
last but not least Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works .
around 8@@ 6000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July , the German steel producers are cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the German Trade Union announced on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the quantity produced went back to the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production has been two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months , the association expects an increase in output due to an improved order situation .
community , spirit , health : singing is good for sen@@ iors
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has already accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , she finished music in the school choir , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and more alive , she says .
by the way , she does something good for her health and mind .
singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior league .
most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular gather@@ ings , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organise , to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for doing so , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled respir@@ ation .
those who regularly demand his lungs will not get out of the powder as quickly as in everyday life .
when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby .
for older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursul@@ a L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Association of the Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Organis@@ ations .
in the older generations joint singing had a much higher significance , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure time , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening of songs in older people awak@@ ens many memories , often connected with positive feelings of their youth .
through lyrics and particularly melodies , even dementia suffer@@ ers de@@ generate long @-@ lying events .
in singing , the head also requires special performance , explains L@@ enz .
at the same time focusing on one &apos;s own voice and rhythm and adapting to the other singers - that &apos;s a great cognitive challenge .
just elderly people who live alone are doing so , not only concentrating on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the sense of self @-@ esteem is also growing through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I stay long for something , I get better and grow beyond myself - this experience rein@@ forces .
good reasons to start singing are enough .
those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate , even if he thinks he has little talent , L@@ enz advises .
you don &apos;t sing alone - in 50 singing people , who hears a sound next to it ?
in search of the suitable offer Sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ tances in a sen@@ iors &quot; choir , one can simply join .
many cities also offer an overview of the choirs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or church leader directly .
many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet .
those who do not have access to the internet can ask the family , friends or neighbors for help in the internet research .
if you want to sing , you should definitely join a choir , H@@ ac@@ kler recommends .
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to all ages .
cats react more sensi@@ tively than han@@ go@@ vers on the scre@@ ams of young animals
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover what effect the sleep of k@@ itt@@ ens has on adult animals .
to their surprise , the mi@@ stress also did not leave the males cold - however , they always remained the same in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the degree of reg@@ ression of k@@ itt@@ ens at the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
they respond by ten percent faster to caus@@ tic k@@ itt@@ ens , who consider themselves in great need , as scientists have fi@@ gured out at the Veter@@ inary Academy and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
cats also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly arous@@ ed young animals for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from MH@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens differ@@ ed with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness .
a total of nine adult males and eight females were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a rep@@ ut@@ ations of babies who were taken out of the throwing box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens , who were additionally lifted up .
the researchers maintain their results despite the low sample for meaningful results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who had no offspring , responded to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they revol@@ ved faster to the speaker when this rep@@ ut@@ ations of the more excited k@@ itt@@ ens played .
this ability may be inn@@ ate or develop@@ ped with sexual maturity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males got re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men to baby noise .
some studies also showed that women re@@ acted more sensitive to infants , no matter if they were mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski resort to Super@@ cup with &quot; Gala . &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
a arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ g in Turkey .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match takes place in Turkey .
prior to the du@@ el of the arch@@ ri@@ vals between Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual . &quot;
even with the suspension of the exceptional state after the attempted coup in July , the government , the everyday life of normal citizens , was not affected .
this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the Movement of Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the attempted put@@ sch .
at the same time , it is not just about football .
the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office issued an arrest warrant against the former star Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ g .
according to this , the Sü@@ me@@ g living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ me@@ g shall be the follow@@ er of the minister Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the attempted put@@ sch by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
the state of emergency , which is initially suspended for 90 days , is still valid until October , but in fact it has virtually no effect on the life of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ gh@@ tly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country declared Erdo@@ gan ended on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - divided into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the working clubs Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
but what the Gro@@ s of the Turks were united in the face of dramatic experience in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ sch .
even the fans agree - no matter if their hearts beat for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prize winner , it will be especially on Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cologne in the past season proved its sporty value : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first playing time as top scor@@ er of his association .
in the final match against F@@ ener@@ b@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the paper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the pre @-@ round kno@@ ck@@ out in the Champions League , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also say good@@ bye to the Europa League . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the south of Li@@ g there was only sixth place .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have done this and that is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the year was better .
thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who presented the basis for the 14th title with 26 season figures as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ ment@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig .
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
in doing so , the Gom@@ ez , signed by the AC of Florence , had announced only borrow@@ ed Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt , not to return because of the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario will come to us , he only has to say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club Princip@@ al Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but to do so , the Stür@@ mer would have to be willing to wai@@ ve about a third of his annual salary valued at 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man made clear : &quot; we cannot pay his salary at Florence . &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes have med@@ als in the Olympic Games in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was already closed twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers Julia Step@@ an@@ ova should not start in Rio .
other super@@ imposed athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh at this - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
the topic of dop@@ ing continues to be the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers in Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ ova , who had compla@@ ined about their starting right before the games after a dop@@ ing lock , was pi@@ ped off mer@@ cil@@ essly at their start ( 100 meters chest ) .
it was a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal setting : with a set smile she was still in the hall and had provoked her appearance .
as a stron@@ gh@@ old they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a storm of applause .
but there are many other sports@@ men who go to the start despite the dop@@ ing past at the Olympic Games in Rio .
here an overview :
J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 year old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he had already been banned two times for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its inc@@ eption , the Olympic Champion of 2004 and former World Champion has been running even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds and is considered to be the greatest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to wait for a six @-@ month lock after taking the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after an operation she had a strong tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended himself .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 , the 2012 Olympic champion , world champion of 2013 and European Championship , had a positive effect on the banned stimul@@ ant agent meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic disputed the know@@ ingly taking and was blocked for six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great gold @-@ favor@@ ed tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic Champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , had been tested positive in 2010 and had been locked for 21 months .
a remedy for penis enlargement was responsible , moist@@ ened Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer Th@@ row , Belarus ) : hardly any ath@@ lete has been recognized as many med@@ als afterwards .
so T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after testosterone dop@@ ing was observed .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to give Olympic Silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the European title in 2006 because of testosterone mis@@ use .
he also received the Bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a verdict of the International Sports Court of CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he ranks second in the world rank@@ ings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record scientist and Gold@@ favor@@ i@@ tin was tested positive first in May but may still start in Rio .
in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , references to the capture of a forbidden dietary supplement were found , the lock of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ dly and ran already on 13 July .
bomb terror in Thailand - Austri@@ ans injured - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand was in contact with the woman , said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she had suffered cutting wounds and had been treated at the hospital but have already left this .
she planned her home journey for the beginning of September .
whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ umph@@ on , also Austrian citizens are still unclear .
in this respect , the State Department is in constant contact with the local authorities , such as de@@ br@@ is .
at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in first explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening in a Night@@ life .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning two explosive charges went up again , while another human being killed , according to the authorities .
Ph@@ u@@ ket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning .
during the det@@ onation in the vicinity of the popular bathing beach Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured following police instructions .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ eastern coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban employee .
according to the authorities in a bou@@ quet of flowers , the blast set had gone into the air in front of the territory of the coast police .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ umph@@ on on the south @-@ east coast demanded several injured .
one goes from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect it to act as a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express himself on possible motives - but it is probably a matter of the deeds of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern typical of the bomb attacks by Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist uprising movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage that is limited to restricted areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is rather assumed that the bombs were imposed by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
the authorities would have received intelligence on upcoming attacks in the south of the country in recent days - however , they did not have been informed of the exact time and places .
it is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
the police instructed their officials across the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are repeat@@ ed@@ ely smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they are mostly not directed against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace used for years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the well @-@ sto@@ cked bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its website to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a , as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no necessary trips to these provinces .
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the coming years .
jun@@ ta chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country was heading for stability , an improvement in economic conditions and tourism .
the military jun@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , is committed to restoring the kingdom again to stability and order .
however , the military has not been able to get a grip on the revol@@ ting uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years .
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
just a year ago , in Bangkok , 20 people were killed in a stroke at a stroke at a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the country &apos;s recent history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has come into the visor of the Federal Office of Constitutional Affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after several regional offices , the Con@@ federation under the Constitution also placed the group under observation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; we see evidence of aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic basic order , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chief Executive Officer Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ eber of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diff@@ use in extrem@@ ist ways .
that is why we are now observing the movement as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s identity by alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - observe the &quot; Identi@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ate said that the decision was closely coordinated with the local authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups such as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the constitutional chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with language , often with pop music .
the fac@@ ul@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a fu@@ tile advertisement for one &apos;s own cause .
the propaganda is intended to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly suscep@@ tible .
this is dangerous .
last but not least , there were reports from several German states about the contacts of the &quot; Identi@@ ties &quot; to Af@@ D politicians .
Ma@@ ate said he didn &apos;t have any knowledge .
for constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , changes their direction and becomes so extrem@@ ist .
the deciding factor therefore is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
with a view to the significant increase in legitimate crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and shel@@ ters , Ma@@ ate said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context .
but in recent years we have found that there can be right @-@ wing terrorist structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ taler Group .
it may well be that other right @-@ wing terrorist groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee camps or attacks from other extrem@@ ist motives .
however , a nationwide or pan @-@ European control of right @-@ wing terrorism is not recognis@@ able .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
they expressed concern about the fact that many ass@@ aults on the account of people who had previously not appeared in the right scene .
that is the wor@@ rying .
many of the susp@@ ects in case of attacks on asylum accommodation were previously not known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed crimes that had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who might have been politically in@@ different , or who voted for example , CD@@ U , SPD or Left , who , however , have radi@@ cal@@ ised themselves by far right extrem@@ ist voting power . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te Bec@@ omes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always the Olympic Games or world records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Centre , the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia sw@@ am so slow that he was temporarily un@@ seen in the TV pictures .
he just disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te became the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old completed his first race with a reset of 48 seconds and took the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not exactly athle@@ tic figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old is still participating in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries known .
since most sports@@ men run in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te simply wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names quickly made the lap .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media called him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rocker of the whale &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; following a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity @-@ b@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the English bou@@ levard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun of him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only hit with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter Fre@@ estyle , played there no role .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i provided media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to travel alone in a run over 100 metres of Fre@@ estyle .
at that time M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim eight months before the Olympic Games and had never had such a long distance before the competition .

according to the police , the 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ ets@@ rie@@ der@@ in had left their business on Monday at 5 : 30 p.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump doesn &apos;t see the lo@@ oming electoral defeat so tight &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Republi@@ can candidate Donald Tr@@ ump speaks at an election campaign in Florida .
if there is nothing to do with the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already an alternative video .
he then goes on holiday .
if Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential elections in November , it doesn &apos;t matter to him : &quot; ultimately it will either fold , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in a telephone interview with the US television station CN@@ BC .
if for him in the end , for reasons of political correctness , it is not rich , be it in order , said Tr@@ ump .
so he called the US President Barack Obama and the Democrats of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) .
within his party more and more resistance was formed .
post rises in trade with electro @-@ transpor@@ ters
an electric @-@ feed vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other firms on the vehicle is obviously great .
the post is planning to sell its electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter as well .
in the near future , the Group wants to start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
the mail will also be able to offer their electric transpor@@ ters on the free car market next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get into the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been checking for months if they are delivered to their self @-@ developed stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter , with which letters and par@@ c@@ els are delivered , also to sell to other companies .
post @-@ CEO Jürgen Ger@@ der had said it &apos;s always giving inquiries , for example by craftsmen .
according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bon@@ ner company plans to enter the mass production of the vehicles shortly .
in the post @-@ owned factory , the company is planning to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift .
Ger@@ des announced that the Group wants to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and make a complete change@@ over to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we convert the entire fleet .

G@@ FR@@ P leadership res@@ ig@@ ns after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges its head Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the reactions came suddenly - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research firm Gf@@ K admitted that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann is all the more uncertain as the longer the successes promised by him remain .
turbul@@ ence at the top of the Nuremberg Market Research Company Gf@@ K : after more dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of the company management , the world &apos;s number five is facing a new beginning .
the G@@ FR@@ P Management Board intends to leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert already leaves the Supervisory Board with effect from September 12 .
the management board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger took over the management of the Management Board as early as 1 September , divided the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shall officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CEO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor is found for Hart@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the long @-@ term business policy as a reason for the res@@ ett@@ lement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company spokes@@ man did not want to mention details on Friday .
the one who will run the market research company in the future is still unclear at present .
on Friday , in investor circles , the disappointment on the continuing success of the restructuring initiated several years ago was to be seen in investors &quot; circles on Friday .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K @-@ summit since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , after 5 years the fruits of restructuring have not yet to be seen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the most recently bad Gf@@ K business figures , each shareholder will become uns@@ atis@@ fied some@@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that were the case with BMW , that would make the qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
following set@@ backs in the previous quarters , the Company did not have to stop its loss of power in the second quarter of 2016 .
at 36@@ 1.2 million euros , revenue was 6.1 percent below the level of the equivalent year @-@ earlier quarter .
relative to the first half of the year , sales of 7@@ 2@@ 1,2 million euros shr@@ ank by 3.4 percent .
earnings in the second quarter were largely imp@@ acted by the dr@@ unken asset of the company in the face of its difficult economic situation .
the company value depreci@@ ation of EUR 139 million , which became necessary in the Consumer Experience Business Unit , gave the Group a loss of 14@@ 8.2 million euros .
in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K still generated a net profit of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - bus sli@@ ps into dit@@ ches in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ n : eight injured
in an accident of a coach with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ n ( district of Aur@@ ich ) on Thursday .
two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , told the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old coach of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to information , had to give way to an opposite vice , which drove partly on the tra@@ m@@ way .
the bus came to the right from the street and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , as a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the bus &apos;s location , the bus couldn &apos;t leave the bus on its own , &quot; she said .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and an emergency ambul@@ ance came to the scene of the accident on the state road 2 .
the un@@ injured travellers were brought back to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ ble district of P@@ ew@@ sum by a regular bus .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the lor@@ ry and possible witnesses to sign up to the police .
the fees per cubic metre of waste water from 1 October 2016 for the wastewater treatment plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ fare 3,@@ 44 instead of currently 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( up to 2.@@ 18 Euro ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the waste water charge will increase again at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a large @-@ scale calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf is then at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , in the approval of the household by the municipal council of Kul@@ mb@@ ach , it was found that under@@ cover for this sewage treatment plant was running .
due to legal foundations , the market of Kas@@ endorf is obliged to operate the plants cost @-@ effectively .
as of 1 October 2016 , citizens and industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ fare , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to go deeper into the wal@@ let .
the cost increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Director of Directors Herbert Schmidt showed the panel , a new calculation of the fees for the sewage treatment facilities of the market community was necessary .
over the period between October 2016 and September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ cover from the previous calculation period must also be equ@@ alled .
Schmidt explained the grave fee increases by means of relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
due to the low distribution basis , expenses for necessary repairs would have a serious impact on several thousand euros .
in addition , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining .
furthermore , in the back @-@ ahead calculation period , renovation and repair expenditure in all three installations had a considerable degree not least due to their age .
the complex in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for world meal , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years .
Schmidt indicated that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the wastewater treatment plant in Az@@ endorf due to damage .
in the pump plant Wel@@ fare , the almost 20 years old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led from the ground up . after almost 20 years of operation , the first sewage pond had to be evacu@@ ated , the sewage slu@@ dge dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation option had to be installed in order to comply with the water @-@ legal requirements in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenses were accompanied by the ongoing maintenance and maintenance costs that must be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were still below the current level in the years 2011 / 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made it clear that in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully interrupted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the three plants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs , added to the sewage treatment plants in the past 20 years .
the situation for the mentioned facilities will remain prec@@ arious after st@@ on@@ stone houses in the long run , especially since the supply area of the san@@ itation association Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal can not be extended by these facilities because they are defici@@ ent institutions .
Bulgaria books for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that in Bulgaria , inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the average annual average of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , a price increase in the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison with the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0,1 % ) .
the prices remained as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as asi@@ an car@@ ic@@ ature critici@@ zed
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its Filter@@ tool , it makes Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders on the absurd .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are bloo@@ ded , self @-@ rotating tools that produce more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all off@@ ences get to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have vo@@ iced criticism in the past when they were accused of promoting the App Black@@ face or promoting white skin as beauty ideal .
when this week some U@@ sers proposed a filter that gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; Yellow face . &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity .
the news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports of The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat announced that it would have de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as a homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced rac@@ ism reminded the filter of inj@@ uri@@ ous c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an email , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose tweet was widely spread over the photos , was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hur@@ t@@ ful and mild to say &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ faced , but that the yellow face has been pulled into the decreasing extrem@@ ity .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural tunnel .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and devices that we all hold in our hands .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats large audiences of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older opponents - could expect to expect sensitivity .
if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters generates an image that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; it is much more difficult for such things to remain un@@ noticed than it was earlier , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete their Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay on medium and in a telephone interview she said she believes that racial controversy will reflect a lack of diversity in the settings practices at Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the large part white , only male leadership and finished their article with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their staff , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but are not in positions where they feel safe or well to say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that has largely left Snap@@ chat un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , it refused Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently hired a HR officer who concentr@@ ates on under@@ represented demographic groups and on internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu said she will leave her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it &apos;s not O.@@ K. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military operations fake IS@@ IS intelligence information , establishes Committee of Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than permitted the actual states on the ground , announced an inquiry committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can members of the Joint Committee , Intelligence Committee and the Com@@ ple@@ mentary Com@@ mit@@ ee , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Intelligence Analy@@ st who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short of C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligence information typically picked up by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders recorded a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism as the actual states were allowed on site and were consistently positive than analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a newspaper article cited the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; noted Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management mistakes in the Cent@@ com extend to the top point of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct indication that government tips have given instructions under Obama to change the reports , it shows how analysts face pressure from their superi@@ ors to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command Press Rel@@ eases , comments and statements made in front of the Congress were much more positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Moz@@ ambique could already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , it &apos;s so clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , Central Command has changed the intelligence reports to reduce the risk of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force into their lives after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights during the investigation .
in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ com reports are underway by the Chief In@@ spec@@ tor of the Department of Defense .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday , which agree with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly limited process for creating intelligence evaluations about IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced the highest ranking Dem@@ ok@@ rat in the Com@@ intern , member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; har@@ med the morality of analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave excessive amounts of room for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats stated that there were no indications of interven@@ ing at the White House at the Cent@@ com analysts regarding a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certain political opinion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the preliminary results of the investigation were published on Tuesday by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s Chief In@@ spec@@ tor , who was taken up after complaints by Cent@@ com analysts .
t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on any reports of the Congress , while the investigation of the In@@ spec@@ tor General is still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also admitted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent views on the interpretation of complex data , and that intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcomed a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful campaign of air under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the alleg@@ ations of last year have raised the question to what extent President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessment of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a document on how the then government under George W. Bush looked forward to the recommendations of many analysts , only a small occupation force in Iraq , and little time went to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the revol@@ t against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
last year , Mr. Hoo@@ ker &apos;s team stated that contrary to the government &apos;s statements , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these temporary refin@@ eries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
however , this recognition was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s at that time , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legislature because of his excessive positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel in Central Command .
the United States wins fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , show@@ down with Great Britain
a day after she shot three goals during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American football team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not one of those who keep their gates in memory . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , she knows this : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , which remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
the United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first @-@ placed runner will take a little longer from the strong Dutch woman who will lead the other group .
whatever the game on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex by their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey player in the hands ( her two older sisters played sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became National Champion of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 as she was not able to qualify for the squ@@ ad .
then came the year 2012 in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team , began to turn things into a better one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we did not have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
we have completely ro@@ cked the ru@@ dder .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the door spre@@ e in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the close range .
India had gone into the game without a win in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the match from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she completed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then pulled in the middle and pushed the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 guide .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the US , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next match on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympics .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel steady and unavoid@@ able , a rapid relay competition between competition and pursuit .
it is like the olymp@@ ic torch itself a burning rod , which is passed from the cross@@ bow to the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the gymn@@ ast for tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbor in the coffee shop without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ cover@@ y or the quar@@ rel between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympics and a women &apos;s flock with dimples , could well have been among these well @-@ known names , who are sent to Prime Time , built up by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV ads , if he would be a swi@@ mmer , tur@@ ner or even fen@@ cer .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting for gold in the olymp@@ ic tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
further from the centre , partly in the shade are the sports that are not universally recognized : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast@@ stroke and may it rule for a long time .
but if I think it should be modest for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw your attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , it became so spar@@ sely noticed for the last 16 years that many people I had questioned did not know that it is an Olympic sport .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to competition , it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had had an ath@@ lete until 2012 , who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians are inclined to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the trampoline has a certain out@@ sider , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ lown school than the one for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I &apos;m not an expert , but only a d@@ ary enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ ous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of its never @-@ ending impact - but also the Gra@@ zie of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two sports that it essentially combines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spring@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
asp@@ iring winners jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet .
they are rated according to the official Olympi@@ ad according to design , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts must continue in their quest for gold , faster , up and over , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes down and back , up and down on the playground .
they hunt not only the finish line or the exit wall , but in the television transmission also another hei@@ ghted objective : the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord .
the goal @-@ oriented pursuit is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir up a spect@@ ator into tears .
but it &apos;s also what I feel a bit ti@@ ring when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly up again .
here too there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant suspension of time and gravity .
it &apos;s as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be .
the qualification and final rounds of the women will be held on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.@@ 00 onwards .
in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in the general tur@@ mo@@ il .
if the increase of consciousness can only be achieved through the fear and obj@@ ectiv@@ eness of male athletes - as the male US Tur@@ ner proposed recently , according to The Wall Street Journal - Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fans to breathe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a generation protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ethiopia , Long is an ally of the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters calling for political changes in Ethiopia cl@@ ashed on the government &apos;s violent resistance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
witnesses testified that ump@@ teen prot@@ esters were killed during the cl@@ ashes with the police during shooting changes .
is Ethiopia having to break up ?
over the past ten years , it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months protests against the government were shaking the country and expanding into ever more areas .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the response of the government was ruth@@ less .
witnesses testified that police fired and killed dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
in circulation , videos on the protests that are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security people hit young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the UN Human Rights authority is now calling for a detailed investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and will become even more difficult in the future , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the leader of the Horn of Africa , the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West .
American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorism across the region , particularly in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but an example of democracy - human rights organizations continually led repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted and dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven to the expan@@ se of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and do not have any other options other than prot@@ esting , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole youth protests .
one generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from soil use to stran@@ gle@@ hold in the power of the ruling coalition .
after a widely critic@@ ised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of parliament .
at the same time , tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den , which have been enforced more or less in recent years , can exploit the turbul@@ ence and be able to arm themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess will now explo@@ de under the surface after years of exposure to H@@ ink@@ öch@@ lar@@ ns .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media because cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the internet services improved .
even if the government un@@ locks the access to Facebook and Twitter , which it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still can communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are .
several young Ethiop@@ ians told them that they gathered to protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons the Am@@ har@@ a , who come from Ethiopia mainly from Christian high@@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas .
but this too is changing .
&quot; we are there to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under one umbrella , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos .
the biggest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , accounting for around 6 per cent of the population , dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was until his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in 2012 for 17 years Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister .
he was regarded as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think around corners .
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to manipul@@ ate opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively obsc@@ ure reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia experienced such an u@@ pro@@ ar was in 2005 after thousands prot@@ ested against elections , which , according to analysts , was apparently ple@@ dged by the government and subsequently stolen .
during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even though there were less than in recent months and that time of un@@ rest has passed quite rapidly .
development experts praised Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction .
but evi@@ dently this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ conception of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an city , attacked by Tig@@ ray and the hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more common in the social media .
analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over neighboring Somalia , although it recently announced that it has closed this base .
while the West wants to support democracy , it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim that Obama was founded IS &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump attempted to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his repeated statement that President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton had not been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State seriously .
this clari@@ fication threw new questions on the communication skills of the Republi@@ can presidential candidates , whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehen@@ si@@ bly with the American public .
it also ent@@ ails his comrades who endeav@@ our to take him in protection during an event@@ ful period , into the peculiar position of explaining statements he could not have meant at all .
having made the suggestion at a election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump ru@@ sted back in relation to the alleg@@ ation on Thursday and insi@@ sted that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was just sar@@ c@@ astic .
the T@@ we@@ et was contrary to the previous day when Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation was totally serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tr@@ ump to weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama would destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can candidate wanted to know nothing about it .
the last storm of criticism un@@ le@@ ashes Mr. Tr@@ ump , while trying to ste@@ er the focus of his campaign because of falling demand values on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Mich@@ ig@@ an this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this topic again .
using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech d@@ ull .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he critic@@ ised himself when he said that the Russians were to h@@ ack Mr@@ s Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained , &quot; Of course , I meant the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic borders in politics and then to call back on demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction falls out . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert , who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates .
but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has accepted an even more corro@@ sive tone , as his surveys have continued to decline .
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was published on Friday , showed a leading edge in North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado , and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying not to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative pron@@ oun@@ cements , he often bl@@ ames his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humor .
but while he is increasingly focusing on the attention during the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal companions into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ atively his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ umps &apos;s most prominent advoc@@ ates , gave himself great trouble to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview of Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said about the accuracy of Mr. Tr@@ ump@@ ur &apos;s statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had established the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama , IS@@ IS was an almost unknown small organization , he called it back @-@ bro@@ kers , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , where Mrs. Clinton served as foreign minister , allowed IS@@ IS to spread out by being aggressive under control of the situation in the Middle East .
in front of the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of ro@@ aming around on each of his words and being prejudi@@ ced against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , poor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ cked Mr. Tr@@ ump@@ ur &apos;s ap@@ ology as a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
once crowded at the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point comes back
Ver@@ b Cafe was a fo@@ aming cafe in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but served good coffee for 15 years .
of course , the prices were pushed out of his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front .
the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie business , replacing Ver@@ b in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people considered it the last loss in a genetically modified city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is exemp@@ t and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is a change , then it &apos;s also new @-@ finding .
a re@@ vit@@ alized Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile to the north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ time employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café .
he began working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a client offered him to provide funds for a new job , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a great deal .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old Ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese on the menu and there are gar@@ nis@@ hing like cap@@ ers and sau@@ erk@@ raut .
there are natural rice dishes .
the café serves no more beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; many old customers were also driven out by prizes from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg before and visited the club regularly .
even after she moved to Green@@ point she would take the path .
after the verb had closed , she gave up the coffee drink for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized that it was at the coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 , Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing and loyal customer .
he went there before the work and inevitably ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch , and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
today Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no res@@ ent@@ ment that the soap business had taken hold of the old business area .
in fact , the owners of So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap for Ver@@ b with the coffee bre@@ wed coffee from the coffee shop as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will respond to their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points also accepted the café .
a new client transl@@ ates the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he pre@@ tends to exhibit her soon so that his new neighbours will feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice bar would like to fill and sell the coffee bre@@ wed coffee .
there is a chance that the café is expanding onto a neighboring building .
for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favour@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to smell this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a plentiful meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascension to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a gour@@ mets , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined del@@ inqu@@ encies of Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle Sou@@ p .
his menu on that day was a bit more modest : stuff@@ ed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to Americans how they should eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acted from Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Ziegel@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about living in a residential building on the Lower East Side from a food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a repor@@ ter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , snow@@ y snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate .
when the repor@@ ter Hack@@ eng@@ fry ordered , this found the couple suitable for discussing the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were made from an ingredient and a little cheaper , which stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ in @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked p@@ â@@ té for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Americans sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; records the ways with which the country turned to be no longer the land of land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for the Americans became a central , ten@@ se issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e started explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new Bud@@ get@@ diet was just as ten@@ se : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ole as a &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; says Ziegel@@ man , as chefs were able to hide un@@ pal@@ atable ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit .
meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rare luxury .
strange mixes have been tried out because a high cal@@ orie and nutri@@ tious grati@@ fication had preced@@ ence over taste or even healthy cooking .
during their research for the book , which includes recipes , Bri@@ ck@@ man prepared a dish of this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; it was not a popular addition at noon , &quot; Co@@ e says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
as never before or since , household econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - contributed to the eating habits of the country .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; domestic politics &quot; and the challenge of turning P@@ amp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a feast of historic delicacies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the reports on the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Cake @-@ Essen pose , are particularly tasty .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farmer &apos;s kitchen of his kitchen , he fed like the million@@ aire man from the world to whom he became .
&quot; he liked continental cooking like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gold @-@ plated dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderfully realistic .
President Roos@@ ev@@ elt may have committed the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to use his stomach to make an example .
as described in the book , the home of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Mr@@ s Roos@@ ev@@ elt made the White House produce the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food , was rejected as soon as the country returned to their legs .
the legacy is based on our continued focus on calories and food , bri@@ ck@@ man , as well as on how science was applied to food .
the couple gave a better understanding of eating habits of Ziegel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for example , how she could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of food waste , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , she made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the pre@@ f@@ ecture of the wind .
after the plates at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s were cleared , they drew up a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert that President Roos@@ ev@@ elt did for lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man and added that it was a nasty trick to give a modest name to modest recipes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone di@@ pped something reluct@@ antly into the t@@ ame , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber .

killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save the lives of others .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has now died in the Assad regime &apos;s bom@@ b@@ astic attack .
O@@ mar was a member of White Helm@@ ets , a civil protection group that saved almost 60@@ ,000 people worldwide according to Bild @-@ Zeitung .
29@@ 00 Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers use their own lives to draw people from sh@@ attered homes and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civilian guard showing him during an 11 @-@ hour rescu@@ ing of an inf@@ ant from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbol figure in the horror of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a hero , he never saw himself , said al@@ oud : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is true Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die in saving life , I think that God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video of the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters threw four barrel bombs over the Alz@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now removing the toxic rem@@ nants of the bomb , so that children cannot play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image c@@ ites his final words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship S@@ anna .
it was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland h@@ arks will only get up to 150 years of offspring .
lei@@ surely the Greenland shar@@ k flo@@ ats along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it comes on average just 1,@@ 220 meters wide .
only when it comes to it , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates at a sat@@ te 2.@@ 6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a seal .
but this lifestyle shaped by slow@@ ness seems to be a patent for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; in any case from a Greenland shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; comments Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock this life span that means a world record for verteb@@ rates .
it is true that the evolutionary bi@@ ologist has long believed that Greenland &apos;s hair will become st@@ ony .
only lack@@ ed the evidence .
Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks are difficult to observe , after all they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface only in the winter .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s hair .
her slow @-@ tur@@ pent@@ ine was , as she pointed out , six animals with one transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
the loo@@ t nevertheless makes this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
maybe they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice @-@ sea and look for cad@@ aver , which tor@@ ches from higher water @-@ layers down@@ wards .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland sh@@ arks which caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ res long , while the biggest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ re was measured .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the carbon @-@ 14 method the l@@ enti@@ l nucle@@ us of the sh@@ arks .
this centre of the eye lens arises before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained therein will not be renewed later .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had a stri@@ k@@ ingly high carbon @-@ 14 in the l@@ enti@@ l nucle@@ us .
their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s , when atomic weapons retri@@ eved larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
with 220 centimet@@ res of length of the third smallest animal , the l@@ enti@@ l nucle@@ us , on the other hand , contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday during its investigation in 2012 .
all larger Greenland sh@@ arks on the other hand had normal carbon @-@ 14 @-@ quantities in its l@@ enti@@ l nucle@@ us , which arises through cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact the carbon @-@ 14 clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 years for a 4@@ 93 centimet@@ re @-@ long Greenland shar@@ k , while the record shar@@ k might be 3@@ 92 years old with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers .
that Greenland shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to classi@@ fy an age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland &apos;s hair with the multip@@ lication is obviously at least one and a half centuries time .
this is also likely to be a world record for verteb@@ rates .
it is no coincidence that such methane gas lives mainly in icy waters .
also the previous record holder , a 211 year old Greenland W@@ hale , whose bac@@ on at the neck was a 120 year old har@@ po@@ on tip , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the living animals often runs on as@@ par@@ ag@@ us .
they mature later - and age more slowly .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are also often very big .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than at a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very big animal should , on the other hand , invest its resources in a long life .
building site in double pack
in the recent meeting , the Municipal Council has focused mainly on topics relating to building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the committee accepted the communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the land , par@@ cel@@ er@@ ation and clos@@ eness questions were clari@@ fied and the applications for measuring could be made , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; Road route &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - extension section 1 ) to interested parties nothing more in the way .
the Municipal Council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and peaceful residential community will appeal to young families and former sen@@ iors in equal measure .
as it was said , members of the municipality can sign up immediately at the Town Hall , and the municipal council is expected to advise the municipal council in its September meeting .
in order to accommodate requests for sett@@ ling further industrial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the Municipal Council decided to change the land use plan in sub @-@ areas only in the spring of this year .
in the area of Unter@@ hr@@ lar@@ n the commercial area is expanded by two plots in the direction of the state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
the city on the Main has therefore the best opportunities to attract new jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the International Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of the I@@ W .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether financial transactions will continue to operate from London on financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , approval in the UK is already sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why big US banks are taking advantage of this .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ates 10@@ 000 new jobs on the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , so the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which unites the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority , E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk corporate ES@@ R@@ B .
while in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Luxembourg holds a large fund industry , it also cuts off worse in infrastructure as well as Dublin .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
the city also points to easily available commercial real estate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the Seine , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial real estate are 50 percent higher than on the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , as well as less crime .
in a ranking of corporate consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city was ranked 7th , Luxemburg in number 19 , Dublin at No. 33 and Paris in 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a question of preference , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With its already strong position as a financial hub for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , my business researchers .
in London , according to the figures of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015 , and in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead acqu@@ ires legal costs of hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal costs arising from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was liber@@ ated from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which were related to the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct by mer@@ ks , including Mein@@ stained and other un@@ ethical actions .
in the case of a complaint on Thursday , US Secretary of Justice Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman stated that Gilead is entitled to leave the costs incurred during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ ate with Gilead that controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can heal over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck took advantage of each other and claimed ownership on laboratory work , which sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir was granted , the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead .
U.S. supported troops say that they have reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
troops supported by the United States have reg@@ ained complete control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city left them , said a group spokes@@ man on Friday .
the demo@@ cra@@ cies of Syria ( D@@ KS ) stem from the departure of the remaining group of fighters who have been buried inside the city , currently the city .
they released over 2,000 civilians who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council , al@@ lied with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is under complete control now , but we are just carrying out clean @-@ up work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s earnings earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday her tax return for 2015 , which resulted in an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million for the Democrats and her husband , and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ mption . the former Secretary of State issued an income of USD 3 million from Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster &apos;s publishing house for her office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for Vice Pres@@ i@@ dency , Sen@@ ator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax statements for the last ten years along with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false statements and re@@ trac@@ ts in relation to his hitherto promises to publish his tax statements .
it is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax statements , although they are not obliged by law to do so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have declared a tax audit by tax authorities as the reason for his refusal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Clinton &apos;s election campaign hel@@ per Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , with regard to the publication of the Democrats candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ ump Special Ad@@ visor , told CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before tax inspections are not completed .
critics , among other things , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already stated that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown the theme and published a video on the internet on Friday in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump asked to publish his tax return .
on Thursday , she also addressed the issue during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ ig@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax statements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO announced that Tr@@ ump has paid no or very little taxes for two years during the 1990s , and a business journalist from the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ers on Friday , stating that this could still be the case .
federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation named after billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would make sure that people who earn more than USD 1 million will pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its seat here to exchange plat@@ former to a meeting to discuss their tax declarations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a tax examination of the I@@ RS and I am &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; afraid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has released tax return to 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons who are now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , on average paid an effective federal tax rate of ca . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 40@@ ,5 % .
the tax return of the 2015 Clin@@ tons showed that they only paid $ 100 of their income as a reward , unlike most of the Americans .
its main financial investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clin@@ tons &apos; divi@@ den@@ ds and income of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed .

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ works promote Tanzania &apos;s Ele@@ ph@@ ant Protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going in inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ y .
the method has proved effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , who had already had the idea for years ago , together with U.S. natural protection intensified its funding by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania , using a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method for protecting their homes and harvesting without hur@@ ting animals .
previously , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves .
Friday is the world phone day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the tool@@ kit , we were able to see a change in their attitude within these communities , although they are much more confident that they can stop the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the eleph@@ ants in doing so , &quot; said Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell .
the first two steps encomp@@ ass the light of the elephant with a torch and the blowing in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ch@@ illi @-@ cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mixed with earth together with a fire@@ work body , it is packed into a con@@ dom which ends up to the ignition cord .
when lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a pop and spra@@ ys fine dust at ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der into the air .
a touch is usually already sufficient to hunt the elephant .
one last possibility is a ver@@ fer who shoots a fire@@ work fire@@ works in the air and causes a loud , bright explosion .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fundamentally , we welcome new businesses , but at this location in an exposed position on the banks of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk does not fit &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director sm@@ ashes Berlin hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media intoxic@@ ation after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli pres@@ election as the Arab guests were &quot; requested &quot; according to an employee . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the list of country codes of the hotel .
however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center .
looking for an explanation , the director contacted the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sent him &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel staff said the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it triggered even more anger in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election be cleared , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great dis@@ grace &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were horri@@ fied by this event and troubled .
this is really very embarrass@@ ing .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater shame .
this does not require explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large resonance on the internet , in which people called the whole thing a sc@@ andal .
some of them submitted to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that there would have been the supposed promp@@ ting of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was said in another article , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ sten@@ damm , stands near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly rejected all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct order &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to not take Israel into the quick @-@ selection list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code has been added .
police op@@ ts tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met with the police in Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reform for the public education system .
the police launched tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , causing the police to take rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about the plans .
according to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s proposal of Sao Paulo Ger@@ ald Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are implemented to save money .
some of the prot@@ esters saw gra@@ ff@@ iti on walls against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er .
the recent protests took place several days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dismissed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trading rate between Moscow and Te@@ hr@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the previous year .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian companies on businesses in the country grew strongly , the ambassador announced .
Russian companies are taking up existing ties with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trading rate between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade revol@@ t was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan is expecting a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
last year , the Russian agency delivered around 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens .
moreover , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries concerned with the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only relatively few Russians are visiting Iran , something of which the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; personally I can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have received the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said .
search for witnesses : beverage store covered in forest fires
a rob@@ ber@@ y attack has been practiced on Thursday evening on the drink market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
by holding a gun , three dark @-@ dressed people , who had m@@ um@@ med up their faces , asked the staff of the beverage market to return cash and then fled initially on foot and then probably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf .
how much money was taken , the police did not share with them .
the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters tall , so relatively small .
the drink market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the re@@ we market and is poorly visible .
the perpetr@@ ators must be in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg , and must be fled from the gravel parking lot located opposite the parking lot with the silver @-@ colored car , possibly towards B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who have made observations at the time of action ( at 7 : 45 p.m. ) , who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y attack , should urgently report to the police .

the life @-@ joyful group was lod@@ ged in the quiet leisure centre Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle during the first school holiday week .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand , we went to B@@ save with the visit of the mat@@ z@@ oos .
on the other hand , according to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special nursery in the world @-@ famous monastery .
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Celtic Museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group experienced a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days , the group enjoyed themselves at the Tiefen@@ see in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited for jumping , swimming and sp@@ lashing .
children and coaches with their own homemade dishes such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ f@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , English @-@ breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese were treated to culinary delights .
workshops were designed to create beautiful pieces of jewelry made of pearls and stones , or made of wood a Roman @-@ Mill game .
other highlights of leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te E@@ ven@@ ing . &quot;
on the day of the journey home , the sun was laugh@@ ing and the children and young people returned home satisfied .
ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the Do@@ or of Mer@@ cy
the altar boys from the pastoral care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , St. Anna , were on the way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
four stages were dealt with together .
in order to bridge the time to the next Rom@@ ance journey of all the mini@@ ons in two years , the St. Anna &apos;s round of mini@@ stries is determined to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
various pilgrimage destinations were examined and one finally decided for the bishop &apos;s city of Freiburg , where , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy on the Freiburg cathedral .
16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and the rooms of the saints , were in the way .
in the evening before , Pastor Stor@@ ey sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgri@@ m crosses and par@@ ted pilgri@@ ma@@ ges .
from Hor@@ b we drove by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Mu@@ enster Lady of Our Lady stands and so the Pil@@ gri@@ mage from Münster was started .
the individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening , accompanied by a short impulse with different prayers , songs and lyrics .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is on field cross@@ ings , chap@@ els or churches repeatedly stopped to sing together a song out of specially compiled pilgrims song booklet .
for the overnight stays parish homes of the local par@@ ishes were available .
Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller were responsible for a tasty and energi@@ zing dinner and breakfast .
on the second day we passed Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
after that , one stepped up the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of the road , but at first some 500 metres of altitude had to be climbed and then climbed .
the deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the Bad@@ wei@@ her in the evening .
after the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter it went to Freiburg .
visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy the Min@@ is arrived in the later afternoon at the Freiburg Min@@ ster and went through the gate of mercy .
with a small impulse , God was given thanks .
at the evening mass in Münster , the Min@@ is who arrived at the pilgri@@ m &apos;s destination were greeted by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t .
after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the B@@ reis@@ gau Met@@ ropolis .
in the afternoon we went by train back to Hor@@ b .
at the end all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were co@@ ined .
Scot@@ s@@ man Call@@ um Sk@@ inner rus@@ hes home when Br@@ ite has won Gold for cycling
Schot@@ t@@ lands Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ced last night in the men team spr@@ int in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glas@@ gow embark@@ ed on a role that his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y made himself E@@ igen . the J@@ unk@@ und made the legend proud when he rus@@ hed home to take home a victory from the favor@@ ites New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after they scored only a modest sixth place at the London Under@@ ground World Championships in March , despite the res@@ ignation of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as hin@@ dran@@ ce .
Ho@@ ys retirement created a gap that ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Scot@@ s@@ man that has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ di , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner won a qualifying round in the qualifying rounds , but the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ di fell short after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation when Hin@@ du drove in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as a BBC expert and noticed Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ di when they climbed onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glas@@ gow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for myself .
we set up an Olympic champion in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 on the site of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys Hin@@ du admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the train .
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no appeal by England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ di said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like the whole UK flags on the tri@@ b@@ une like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we got so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win back at the Olympics again .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if that is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we are expecting successful five days in velo@@ drome .
with the form of Kenn@@ y it is in the realm of the possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a contest .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for British sport ; on that day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were also born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be the same by Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y will take part in the spr@@ int that will start today and will go for three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a little lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ di said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ mile race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
yesterday he had cont@@ ested with officers before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his height .
Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ el S@@ hand@@ , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ es advanced in the world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 in the respective women &apos;s competition , which will be continued tomorrow .
the UK team relies on his strong rail team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a medal at med@@ als .
after a truly exceptional presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
dra@@ mas played in the background , such as Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s res@@ ignation in April in the midst of sex and mo@@ b@@ bing repro@@ aches as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
but when one looks at the first evening of the competition in the velo@@ drome , it looks as if the legendary reputation of G@@ Bs , which reached its climax at the perfect moment , could be repeated again .
future of the sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land due to the removal of the energy consumption question@@ able
the future of the aluminium mel@@ ts of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake , as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thereby canc@@ els all delivery contracts , such as the supplying energy company announced .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies for the operation of the plant .
a subsi@@ dy set for 20 years will exp@@ ire in November .
up to 2000 jobs at the Al@@ coa plant in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk of closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects , as the melt mill consum@@ es around 10 percent of the entire electricity generation Victori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry melt which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
the enam@@ el of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
this step follows the long @-@ lasting speculation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium jo@@ inery with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three more owners will termin@@ ate their contracts .
the facility is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L expects the plant to continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through the melt , &quot; announced the company .
AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; hed@@ ging transactions , &quot; which would have come into effect from November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 month notice period so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from this point , AG@@ L expects the contracts to contribute to revenues in the fiscal year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the current supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on AG@@ L revenues from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by forec@@ asting the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale prices .
AG@@ L announced that it had already depreci@@ ated the value of the contracts in its annual subscription amoun@@ ting to $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of a dis@@ miss@@ al . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did not interfere . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said that 2010 has concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , who should have come into effect from November this year even though it is still a statement guilty of why it res@@ ig@@ ned from the contract .
due to the poor economic conditions in the industry , analysts are warning about the potential closure of the Port@@ land melt plant in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
in reference to statements by analysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses some 600 meg@@ a@@ watts each year to consume around 900 MW of electricity each year .
if both systems van@@ ish from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator , that wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and the fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner clan , Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the U.S. Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the view of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all .
the cover of the cover was followed by a bizarre ( or simply keeping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hy@@ an &apos;s ) , which shows the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner family ( with the exception of Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n problem cases as well as in the presence of the most popular show bi@@ z un@@ cle and producer of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) : they all planned a surprise party .
this represents the c@@ lich@@ é plot of almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ ar@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity .
with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has begun with certainty .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes her , as regards the vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for herself .
the September issue is the most sold edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference that looks more like a picture book than a fashion magazine , the issue pul@@ ls a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista have been advertising from the 8@@ 32 pages of the tome 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the revelation of his cover star is so eag@@ erly awa@@ ited that in the last two years images of the magazine have been filtered before official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there have been clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar Award Win@@ ner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even with the small chance that Ms. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breakthrough model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of her generation - falls under the former category , she is in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything is true to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who exc@@ el in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , was one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course , J@@ enny &apos;s success doesn &apos;t like everyone .
with reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers was always a little ten@@ se in the fashion world .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critic@@ ised and called them &quot; the mi@@ st@@ let@@ oe of the moment . &quot;
these feelings were again high when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but running around on the mis@@ sm@@ ut seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
she is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters are selling pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds &apos;s daughter to the magazine W@@ TV .
and in her free time she is in Reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
community centres annually assign 160@@ ,000 people
more than 16@@ 0.000 of the country &apos;s emergency services are rejected annually by the municipal authorities , while the industry is preparing for the effects of other medi@@ ums on already over@@ bur@@ dened transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy people , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ ations and the like - are rejected in their search for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ stretched , are ready for further cuts .
as of June next year , these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their funds .
the director of the Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l municipal detention centres said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Law Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people were dismissed every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only be worse without the abolition of the decision by the Federal Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s Common Law Centr@@ es are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means thousands of people from important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ a@@ geable and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been un@@ just@@ ly dismissed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need .
from June 2017 , the federal government will cut funding by 30 percent , which means thousands of people in need from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call on the Secretary General and the Minister of Justice and Justice of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately lift these medi@@ tations , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid on the national average .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the coun@@ cils and their communities and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government inv@@ ests in this important work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign accused after employees alleged weapon
new York : Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s Camp@@ a@@ ign was indic@@ ted for alleged in@@ action after it was told that , in February , their campaign leader for North Carolina put a gun on a staff while they were travelling in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment filed by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i on Wednesday , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ordin@@ i started to have waited for months that the matter would be settled internally before he realised that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulled a pist@@ ol , put his right finger on the trigger , and ra@@ mm@@ ed the barrel in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave B@@ ord@@ i in his indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
having compla@@ ined to the local and regional campaign leadership , B@@ ordin@@ i stated that at least four more people had had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he stated in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the prosecution comes only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate triggered an uph@@ eav@@ al when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arms and arms friends - should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton had to be elected and judge .
the campaign made it clear that the media had torn his words out of context and that he wouldn &apos;t inc@@ ite violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ordin@@ is &apos;s complaint demands compensation from the campaign for breach of due diligence and by Philip for bodily harm and permanent psychological damage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hope Hi@@ cks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s press spokesperson was not to be reached for a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
attempts to contact Philip also failed .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer a member of the campaign .
responding to calls from his consulting firm , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted .
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has previously led a controversial campaign .
the procedure is B@@ ordin@@ i by Donald J. Tr@@ ump For President Inc . , 16 @-@ CS @-@ 14@@ 300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) .
Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before country elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) considerable losses for the government parties SPD and CD@@ U are distinguished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to go@@ vern in the north , this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin .
but in both federal states , the SPD is the strongest party and would have a good chance of continuing to make the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , the SPD mig@@ rated from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago .
according to the survey , the party just remained close to the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is fought between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would be 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the parliament .
despite slight losses , the Green Party hes@@ itated again in the Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag , despite slight losses of 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented at the Land@@ tag with 3 per cent respectively .
according to the survey in Berlin , according to the survey , only 23 percent of the survey voted in the survey ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U was only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
it was still behind the Green Party with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but ahead of the left with 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented at the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties at 14 percent for the first time .
with 5 per cent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , while the pirates would , contrary to 2011 , miss out on the move .
Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago Nokia communic@@ ator entered the market .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thicker and bigger , so it was not good at hand .
on the contrary , it was rather cl@@ ums@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would now suff@@ ice for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; occurred exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , in the stores - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros , fans can still buy the equipment on the internet , but they come from the Stone Age of the Internet age .
20 years ago , however , Communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; office in western pocket format &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for standards at that time : SMS and emails could be sent and received , also via fax , the communic@@ ator was accessible .
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML @-@ Browser , albeit slow .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then we found a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
quite proud was the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , so about 1400 euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 Euro in 2015 .
no one could suspect in August 1996 that communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
everything has changed since then .
the smart phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s &quot; mobile phone line experienced an unprecedented disaster , eventually sold to Microsoft and handled .
today , suppliers dominate the market , all of which came much later than Nokia .
to be online anytime and anywhere , that &apos;s everyday for very many people every day .
in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphones in the world .
approximately 1.4 billion devices have been sold , on Samsung and Apple alone 5@@ 55 million units are accounted for .
worldwide sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
in addition , the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and the t@@ elec@@ om companies come into being .
in the meantime , a whole industry has ar@@ isen around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , then Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the launch of the i@@ Ph@@ ones on Mac @-@ World .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communic@@ ator to easily serve everything via touch screen .
Apple &apos;s triumph@@ al march began , even today , the iPhone is the Group &apos;s most important product .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had the after@@ math .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the Sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
on average every German now looks at his cell 88 times a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all have to learn to get the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said just Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of personnel at the Siemens Board of Directors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must ste@@ er the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just as in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved again by creating new possibilities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities alone , we will have 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips , create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who think that the challenge of expanding He@@ ath@@ row is too big .
I have been told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ am@@ using on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcoming , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question asked .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in real @-@ time growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both to leave the airport and the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - which was built five years as a result of the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the middle of the world &apos;s two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time for us to ste@@ er this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and M@@ ouse Game &quot; regarding ad blocking
companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers , try to circum@@ vent ad blocking , a &quot; cat and mouse play . &quot;
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display block@@ ings on its desktop site , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it informed that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop site would change coding in terms of advertisements to make it more difficult to identify what part of the advertising site is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blog post the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of h@@ in @-@ and @-@ back struggle between the ailing open source community and the conver@@ ters has been underway since the invention of display blo@@ cker , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook comes soon with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media enterprise has entered the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicator blo@@ wers have become industry .
according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe about 200 million people use display blo@@ cker worldwide , almost four times as much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion users of active users who access their mobile devices on Facebook , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertising revenues .
the company has refra@@ ined from advertisement blo@@ cker on desktop PCs because mobile ad blo@@ cker have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , shared a spokes@@ man .
advertisement on Desktop PCs makes a sufficient large share of income , so Facebook re@@ alizes the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad preferences tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give people more control over their targeted advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ blocks would be wor@@ rying about new filters because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a positive experience for users , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook spokes@@ man in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt tool which is why we have instead focused on developer tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; woman with suspected suicide on Swiss free@@ way &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was lying in the middle of the night on the motorway .
the police are calling witnesses after a woman was transferred to a motorway in the early hours of the morning on a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
a woman lay down in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police declared in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss woman , at the age of 49 , who was over@@ driven by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she still died on the spot .
several drivers have already heard , but some have still not been identified , &quot; said the police , calling for them and every witness to the incident to sign up .
an investig@@ ative procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , Gil@@ les Hof@@ st@@ etter distributed to Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve .
it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not held ac@@ coun@@ table .
in each of the two cases - where a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian walks in the middle of the night on the highway as it was called in the newspaper .
last year a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent killing , after passing a man and killing a man who lay on the A1 in August 2014 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and was unconscious on the street , took the judgment .
the court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman -- responding to an emergency call -- went to a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; perfectly unusual and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges should contact the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus once lived hab@@ itable
according to the projections of a new NASA climate model Venus was probably hab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus by means of tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have rejected similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and yet slowly moved on .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably showed more dry areas than Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from rapid evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus is exposed for almost two months , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution that previously thought of planets scientists .
although it was probably hab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billion years .
their oceans evapor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or burnt out of ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro @-@ gene lag@@ ged behind only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide returned with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that as we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy comes back as a trainer of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy dropped back on Thursday as a coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to low co @-@ determination during the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively president / general manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new trainer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of summer , I thought about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , this requires it and bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly adapted to the organization .
it must also have a right to co@@ determination in decisions affecting the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organization and wish him the best for the future .
Roy was recognized as the best trainer of the league during his debut season with the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
he led the club to 112 points and in the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the post@@ season in each of the last two years .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card Spot at the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadi@@ ens and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
North Des@@ ee@@ pers resume talks , strike out on strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour struggles on wages for North Sea oil workers are suspended , while all parties sit down for a new round of talks , negoti@@ ators said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ cally carried out on platforms in the North Sea , which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Wood Group and the Un@@ ites and R@@ MT trades unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution process of the current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold several full @-@ day sessions in the coming weeks , which will start at the beginning of next year in order to restart the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , the Wood Group has shortened the rates of its counter@@ parts in the North Sea by around 9 percent as a result of negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s rate reduction follows a 10 percent drop in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts will give the company the space needed to get through the market down@@ turn .
shell dismissed thousands of people and announced plans to ren@@ ounce its oil and gas business operations in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its meg@@ al@@ cap with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure due to the lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that was reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish parliament member Dave Anderson at the beginning of this week met with workers &quot; leaders to discuss one of the largest employment disputes that took place in the North Sea since a generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and across the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea are expected to be around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rot@@ ational rate of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the newest mission with Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates under the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data will help astronom@@ ers understand why stars in the star cluster rotate in different rates , and in which context the rotation periods are associated with planetary formation .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star brands , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades is about 4@@ 45 light @-@ years away from the earth .
many stars in this cluster of stars , which emerged around 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ thood .
they are now the quick@@ est .
at peak @-@ rotation rates , these po@@ ign@@ ant stars thrust large amounts of star @-@ winds .
as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star fails , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rot@@ ational rate of each star by recogni@@ zing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the newest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars revol@@ ve more slowly than less solid stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars revol@@ ving more slowly than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
as the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades provides an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to learn more about how , when and why stars de@@ cel@@ er@@ ate their rotation rates and so to speak their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dance shoes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star ki@@ cks off
with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , the tears ran faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days from Base to Base .
after his emotional withdrawal notice , the 41 year old pro will wear the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on 12 August against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m saying &quot; Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star Game player in the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) declared .
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature , under a ten @-@ year contract , gave him $ 27 million annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will act as a consultant and youth coach in the future - with full salary .
as a player , it paid tribute to Rodri@@ gu@@ ez for a long time .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he succeeded in creating some mil@@ estones .
with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two other bas@@ eball players have similar values in the most important statistics .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is not likely to be included in the resting hall of the bas@@ eb@@ alls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was in the field , his appearance outside the place was so controversial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 the super@@ star was awarded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was banned from 2001 to 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was closed for 211 roles in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the main suspect to have received performance @-@ promoting agents for years through an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a law@@ suit , the lock was reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league might even have done a favor for 2014 , because I played through 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at the time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his farewell @-@ days are not silent .
while many bas@@ eball legends have once again received the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win any game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and told the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , received sympathy for the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ arch@@ riv@@ al Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; sang the fans at 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez @-@ Team .
Olympic 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Gei@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , weight lif@@ ter Adrian Gei@@ sh@@ in@@ sky cannot start from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
a caught ath@@ lete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh day of competition , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become known in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter @-@ obstacle in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Gei@@ sh@@ in@@ sky have been positively tested in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the start of the already critically @-@ eyed athle@@ tics competitions these messages come to an end .
in Ch@@ en , the ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de had been demonstrated last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court ( CA@@ S ) confirmed the expul@@ sion of the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had occupied fourth place in the final over 100 m of butter@@ flies , only about 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have allowed to take part in the 50 m free @-@ style runs .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) asked for an opening of the B Trial Chamber and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very seriously and requires Ch@@ en &apos;s full co @-@ operation in the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a communication : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court of CA@@ S and will accept the judgement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio the news le@@ aked at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she was innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the athle@@ tic woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , the banned substance should be the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova was suspended for the time being , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should also have been positive .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov immediately reported on the issue of the ath@@ lete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not pull the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ed nation must not participate in Rio .
on Friday the case &quot; Adrian Gei@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z had previously tested positive for the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid n@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days before .
both deny taking , however , both must not start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athletes , especially the case of Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the world association IA@@ AF prohibited the entire Russian team up to an exception for systematic dop@@ ing at the start , as well as the transfer nation of Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in swimming sports , the former off@@ ences in China also ensured fierce disputes between the athletes .
so the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic Champion Sun Y@@ ang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium more than 200 m of fre@@ estyle , I want to hand it over , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in French radio .
sun was also at the heart of a confrontation with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing frau@@ d@@ sters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun had been positively tested with the Chinese Championships in 2014 for the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but only had to wait for a three month lock .
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de black@@ mail chi@@ pper your ran@@ som
black@@ mail program@@ mers are currently target@@ ing companies - and are successful .
according to a recent survey conducted by the malware rescue specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes under 540 companies in North America , the UK and Germany , 40 percent of the questioned companies in the past twelve months were at least once , in part multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany nearly 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 per cent of the victims readily paid the ran@@ som demanded by the perpetr@@ ators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again .
the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes to attack in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially black@@ out ran@@ som is significantly higher than in private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently witness@@ ing an alar@@ ming fast evolution of the malware , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes leader Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most of the painting programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
first , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks quickly happened in the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , searches for recently changed files such as Word , Excel or database files , as well as files and videos archives .
these files encryp@@ t the Ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
in order to get the final key code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of the cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin .
however , where private users have the personal photo database at stake , companies are dealing with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production still stops .
accordingly , the damage is higher when a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes .
22 percent of the German companies affected reported sales losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to completely break the business activity , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany several hospitals have already been victims of attacks , whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : don &apos;t pay , you only support the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay will recover their data .
for managers , it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetr@@ ators in view of a stand@@ still in operation .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , F @-@ Secure researchers have investigated the user interfaces and contact with the black@@ mail and come to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain to their victims via chat , how they can pay via Bit@@ coin , set free @-@ to @-@ access support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t sample files for free .
and if private persons are redeemed for payments of a few hundred Euros , companies must partly negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums in order to get their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , h@@ ack@@ ers are becoming more and more professional and share the work , explains safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
it is more likely that there are three or four persons .
the program@@ mers then sell their malware in the form of a software tool@@ box to the real black@@ mail .
the malware kits now developed by buying malware from itself , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; included in delivery is an adaptation tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the black@@ ma@@ sts are then looking for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so one logs in one of the forums on the underground , bu@@ ys the set of one criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is made per infected computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the criminals employ sp@@ amm@@ ers with spreading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies that better secure their data .
over 50 per cent of the corporate IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes questionnaire trust to be able to rep@@ el ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful earnings , the offen@@ ders thre@@ aten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes leader Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that the potential for damage is even higher than before , depending on the type of data .
in future , the perpetr@@ ators could hen@@ ce@@ forth take completely new targets on the internet of things on the grain .
at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz , Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of the winter the activation of such a blocked heating could be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpetr@@ ators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of the heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .

the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit @-@ top is something off .
more versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V for storage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a luggage compartment of 4@@ 53 l with raised and 10@@ 26 l available with inver@@ ted back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like cinema chairs and thus offer storage space , which is 1,@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling .
the trunk is well loaded , but the load height is 650 mm higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel engine with 88 kW / 120 hp speeds up the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
he should do his job a little qui@@ eter though .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is grati@@ fying .
there is another engine : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a four @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the steering should be somewhat more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment does not leave any wishes un@@ fulfilled in the tested &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; version . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the security systems include the City emergency braking assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the collision war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates because he evalu@@ ates many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when maneu@@ vering . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the remote @-@ light assistant works very reliably .
and the smart speed controller responds to traffic signs detection and throt@@ tles the speed if necessary .
but the full connectivity is only available for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more .
two USB and one HDMI ports lie under the arm@@ rest and are therefore something aw@@ k@@ ward to achieve .
the roughly 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel is fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will get the petrol station from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
Air@@ line is not liable : fall on passenger jet@@ ty
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is conceivable only for dangers which are typical of air transport .
the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff broke a knee cap on the down@@ fall .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline had to pay no compensation to the man .
cases of disease : when the organis@@ er pays
after their journey , ill holi@@ day@@ makers only get money back when the cause of the disease can be found without doubt in the hotel .
this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests are shown to show the same symptoms .
in the case of a negotiated case , a family was severely ill with diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their door w@@ rest@@ ling .
she spent nearly the entire holiday in the room .
their illness brought back the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a faulty sewage treatment plant , which pur@@ port@@ edly had polluted the sea@@ water .
the family believed that the trip was thus lacking - and compla@@ ined against the promot@@ er .
the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs did not succeed in court .
although the sewage treatment plant was indeed defective .
but the organis@@ er only learned about it shortly before the end of the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff .
until then , he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
he did not viol@@ ate his obligations , so judgment .
no im@@ puri@@ ties were found in the samples of the water .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly due to infection - belongs to the general life @-@ risk .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said that after the violence perpet@@ rated by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July many people would have taken care of further attacks .
the state must be pru@@ dent and at the same time react to terrorist attacks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and division . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will not grant this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if offen@@ ders would have to leave the country faster , the security and strength increase the consent of the population for refugee policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve the implementation of the proposals until the German Bundestag election in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle four @-@ digit order of magnitude over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; symp@@ a@@ thetic advertising for terrorism must again be subject to punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
video surveillance is to be improved , the tru@@ ce can be am@@ ended in such a way that the purchase of weapons in the internet is more difficult .
the last much discussed sec@@ rec@@ y for doctors is to be maintained according to the words of de Mai@@ zi@@ ères .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in dialogue with doctors , he wants to look for solutions to reduce the risk of citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said with regard to psychological ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act the radi@@ cal@@ isation of refugees , the Minister considers better social support necessary .
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ zed people .
for the prosecution of criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) de Mai@@ zi@@ ère plans to use cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD leader Gabriel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Interior Minister clearly expressed himself against action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a sla@@ p for the sni@@ ff@@ ers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union to a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of dual nationality .
a general prohibition of full wear is deemed to be un@@ constitutional .
you can &apos;t ban all that is borrow@@ ed , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ q@@ a .
one can talk about rules for example in road traffic or for witnesses in court .
green boss Sim@@ one Peter accused the minister that he wanted to simulate co@@ er@@ cion and ability to act with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terror packages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ wing leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet pro@@ verb@@ s and a sharpen@@ ing of the right to stay bring people in this country no more safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better flow of traffic on the motorway
it st@@ umps regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here is a picture of November .
but this should change : the legal abor@@ tion plan should be extended .
this is good news for all car drivers who stand in traffic on the ambient street every night in traffic jams if they travel via the highway to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the road construction will be extended by 700 meters in the area between the Hammer Road and the Wes@@ eler Street downhill on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16th / 17th August ) next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16th / 17th August ) .
drivers can then import directly from the hammer road to the right .
the big advantage is that traffic is split up early , thereby improving the overall transport process on the busy section of the federal highway 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the county &apos;s representation in Münster @-@ West .
the road train on the feeder trains drivers in front of everything between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the way back goes up to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ h road and sometimes also beyond .
the reason for this is the needle @-@ hole on the B 51 just before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße .
from here , the traffic is guided only one lane via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built back in three quarters of a year ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity to record two @-@ lane heavy traffic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the associated labour market will continue , the competent regional operation cannot say . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , with years to expect , the bridge has an official remaining service life up to 20@@ 34 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the extension of the legal regulation the state enterprise has deliberately chosen the traffic weaker time during the school holidays because it is to be expected with disabilities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
traffic will be passed on Tuesday and Wednesday at the building site .
intercultural journey : cultural offers for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project .
N@@ ima &apos;s Association provides young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule children &apos;s house has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the young theatre in Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by the Association N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; 19 students between eleven and 15 years visited the st@@ aging in the Small House . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster in the context of this project .
most of the young people of the class have come to Münster from September 2015 to March 2016 , among others , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria and speak little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , scenic images and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , so the press release of the young theatre Münster .
N@@ ima &apos;s Association , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from the language , and the young theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project .
from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background will have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theat@@ rical language mediation are in the planning stage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; continues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the increased numbers of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of weather
the weather has made the star @-@ be@@ ck@@ oning @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany a stroke by the bill on the night - but there is still hope .
the night was badly suited for clouds and rain to observe the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we see many shooting stars in the sky .
the Stern@@ schu@@ ppen are Per@@ sei@@ den , which belong to the fastest shooting stars with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us coming up in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
in the evening , one walks around forever , at night one is awake for hours , in the morning is already far from the wake @-@ up ring no more to think of sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , you are in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleeping problems or sleep problems manifest ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many causes behind them , emphasizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ ar , member of the board of the German Society for Sle@@ ep Management and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
what you can see below , however , is the In@@ som@@ nia , i.e. a dor@@ sal and dor@@ man@@ t disorder .
just the passage of sleep feels many people as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board of the German house doctor association with practice in Var@@ el , Lower Saxony .
what &apos;s behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind it can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines .
sleep disorder is not in@@ frequent expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is often common in a depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors condition each other .
for example , those who have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can sleep well , wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to worry about everyday problems and worries , there is an example .
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I go to the doctor with sleeping disorders ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are affected by the day should go to the doctor , advises her .
the impairment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments like stomach or headache .
to allevi@@ ate the sleep disorder , it is important to find out its causes .
behavi@@ oral changes include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or also medicines - classic bed@@ abl@@ ation tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quired .
dor@@ man@@ t Sle@@ ep Medicine is hardly available in Germany , emphasizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary nursing centre at the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
for this reason , in case of problems with sleeping problems , one should contact the family doctor at first , advises her .
this can be clari@@ fied by examining whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep or what happens ?
for the examination in sleep laboratory medicine , for example , in snor@@ ing with breathing sp@@ outs , in case of sleep@@ iness , sleep@@ wal@@ kers or if you do not find the cause of a sleep disorder , Fi@@ etze says .
it is not necessary to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only please do not take a n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the cl@@ adding , one goes to bed at its normal time .
besides the electrodes in the body , one carries a nose @-@ go@@ g@@ gles , a chest strap and a fe@@ eler on the finger .
a camera also records the sleeping ends on the ceiling .
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws where you can put on a better sleep .
start counts : regular sleep and up@@ time , not too long in bed , don &apos;t sleep for too long , don &apos;t watch TV for sleep , avoid drinking alcohol and don &apos;t look at the clock at night - then you start to expect immediately , and that &apos;s not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp has with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler has commented on Facebook to dis@@ appoint the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he first took gold at the Kurz@@ eme World Championships in Doh@@ a while at the same time set his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler has put himself in front of his ex @-@ team @-@ mates who stood in the cri@@ tique of Facebook .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion receives 20,000 € bonus and a jungle king of 150@@ ,000 € should no one wonder about missing med@@ als , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote in the night to Friday on his Facebook page .
the funding system in swimming sports is bad , whereas dop@@ ing controls are very good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this we cannot compete with countries that promote very much and do not see or even operate on the subject of dop@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to make a com@@ eback , he would have to be registered nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency Deutschland ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who cannot control a certain time before WM / OS by independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the election Hamburg , who meanwhile operates an ice cream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de of luggage sealed
professional thi@@ eves at Dus@@ sel@@ dorf Airport
civilian victims of the Düsseldorf police took the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years on Thursday .
the susp@@ ects had committed several bags and luggage ste@@ els as ban@@ de .
at 21.@@ 30 , civil servants at the airport Düsseldorf saw a band known as police officers from past theft crimes .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the middle of July this year and were in a common , labour @-@ friendly and very professional manner .
the specialists of the Criminal Inves@@ tig@@ ator 34 can demonstrate four acts to the thi@@ eves who had travelled to Germany specifically for the crime of crimes committed in Germany .
they had captured over 15,000 Euros in total .
old buildings , a couple of lime trees , in between , another cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Riga Street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in doesn &apos;t seem like that at first sight , but the police force them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if one walks along the road from the east to the west , one passes on play@@ grounds , a fres@@ her kinder@@ garten and a bio shop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ugly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spra@@ yed on the façade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
compared to a Li@@ dl , which is to be demol@@ ished soon , it is already being built : until 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , is , however , preferred in recent weeks with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the inhabitants have le@@ ases , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin Interior Sen@@ ator Henkel has spoken out several times for the police action against the project , the area referred to as &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
on June 22 , the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers were evacu@@ ated , according to official statements , with 30 to 40 officers and three cre@@ ws on the ground , locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown house owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearing was illegal , and a day later , police and construction workers with@@ drew from sympath@@ isers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk vor@@ m sp@@ ät@@ i .
in the immediate vicinity of the building projects there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
left @-@ hand violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who mostly attracts three children , is gener@@ ously anno@@ yed by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house projects they share the care of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , who wanted mostly police protection from v@@ and@@ ali@@ zers left .
the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police force between house occup@@ iers and their neighbours , obviously does not exist .
Friedrichsha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class neighborhood , which today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and a high risk of poverty .
house occup@@ ations and the resulting residential projects have long been part of the neighbourhood : in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer Straße in the vicinity of the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer was evacu@@ ated under a large police force in a real road Battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago .
at the same time , the city district has become a magnet for tourists and elec@@ tors from all over the world in recent years : with them , residents from the GDR times and former house occup@@ ants share their neighbourhood .
this is also reflected in the r@@ ents that have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development : they can be seen on thrown pan@@ es or freshly painted facades , which were thrown with color bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year as often in the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason for not all neighbours to consider this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as body injury are according to statistics , almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
most of the off@@ ences are made up of fac@@ tual damage , which tend to make new buildings and newly renovated houses more ten@@ ly .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived for 17 years in a ten@@ ement house next to the disputed 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
when it comes to acts of violence , it is important : people in the 94 are their neighbours , they were certainly not .
even the famous burning cars no longer give it any longer in the ri@@ gs .
for the architect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has been deliberately drawn to Riga - and remains .
this is why it was so important that the residents get back their street : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all of a sudden claimed the sovereignty over the part of the city .
but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street will continue to be taken away : fac@@ eless new buildings in former construction gaps that disp@@ lace the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s ultimately property con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well frequ@@ ented here live here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot;
but what should one do if someone else hears ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , including the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for the drawn @-@ out , who anno@@ y himself with colour bombs : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
who draws , should be aware of this - just like someone who pul@@ ls into a pub area that can complain badly about noise there .

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new Refu@@ gee Officer
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in the field of integration and organisation .
she is also a social worker on site .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the Refu@@ gee Officer for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social educ@@ ator supports the management team around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group refugee aid , administration , authorities and who else is involved .
Reg@@ ine Customer from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the experienced pleas@@ ures of wool , which above all has a problem .
so some - less ridi@@ cul@@ ously than rather targeted on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job .
looking for an administrative professional with a talent for languages and people , combined with many years of experience in the field of social work , is an experience of experience in the pleas@@ ures of pleasure .
but administrative work is not its central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le means .
above all , it is about organisation , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activities .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent vac@@ ancy for three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors .
there are large and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
soon new containers are standing at Was@@ en@@ straße
a serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection provision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these properties must be borne by the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the Council of Govern@@ ors to the Commune and Job@@ centers .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
in fact , the administration does not find private apartments .
so far it doesn &apos;t work , so it is dependent on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common apartments need to be emp@@ tied , as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers are placed in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customers and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a fixed lead , there are intern@@ ships , apprentices@@ hips , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be und@@ am@@ aged or furnished .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reported Reg@@ ine Customer .
many work in the building yard or help home@@ owners do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community will result in a positive external effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people must develop a feeling of belonging .
so I need offers like sport , contacts with locals and , above all , language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so the administration and the volunteers also jump here .
it is crucial that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need to explain to the refugees that it is just and they can bridge the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever develops the feeling that he cannot help in Ur@@ bach should not work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate himself .
the clear majority is motivated .
the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and the customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : are the two after the recent events afraid of ra@@ dic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some na@@ ï@@ ve might call &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also the subject of refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ inations kill them completely .
