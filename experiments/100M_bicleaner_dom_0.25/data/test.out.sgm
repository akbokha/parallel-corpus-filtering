<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues looked for a bit of variety with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>

<seg id="10">On Saturday Germany's best golfer was all time - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He had his family run over the complex of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even bother for photographic purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and thus also with the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">In a small gala, the German Sportsman handed over the Golden Sports Pyramid to the man from Anhausen.</seg>
<seg id="15">The sympathetic sportsman does not lack awards.</seg>
<seg id="16">Federal Cross of Merit, Silver Laurel leaf, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the Queen Queen has already rebuked him.</seg>

<seg id="21">For decades, Langer has been promoting the offspring.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trump Economic Policy Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">"" "" "" "investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - this is what Clinton and Trump want." ""</seg>
<seg id="3">The two US presidential candidates, however, are unaware of the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are fundamentally based on a fundamentally philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">Of the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "Trump desires to keep those in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wanted to tax the economy and regulate his death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will massively retire regulations, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has to fulfil certain tasks, it has to open disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why they would raise taxes for the rich, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "investing in that must be invested," "" "says Trump and Clinton almost without word." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the state-critical political party wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So there might be party-internal discussions on the dump.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "pumping wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive coal mining in the US again." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, the Paris climate protection agreement wants to terminate.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "Clinton, on the other hand, intends to explicitly expand the renewable energy with her investment program:" "" "a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the Transpazifish trade agreement, do not want to sign them.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time both do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should also be paid better, Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump desires to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must rinsed, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "on the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens, is standing up to boost growth." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics point out to him that the budget deficit would only be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand Clinton, who at least wants to ask the rich people to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands and proclaim an official end of the eight months "war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I can't resist the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was a handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile impacted angrily, and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restrained circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report all five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if something bad had never happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">It seemed to me that his enthusiasm seemed to be the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiating, sustainable cows showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was kindled.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara of having fallen on the backs of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offense was even greater as it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">To rebuild the veto will be difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months the state-controlled media carried out a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were the allegations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He vehemently denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse that he wanted to hear from the President Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to make a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan first and foremost needs all the friends he can get after spending most of his time on a failed coup d'etat last month.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal attack on the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state TV predicted cheap fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrarian imports were allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti defined it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious to the West, as it reacts its response to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "this is due to the persistent resentment about the EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is eager to benefit from the cool sentiment and reduce Turkey's relation to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, the Russian state of state gained a bonus for claiming support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this splendid palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present, as an analyst once described, "Alliance of outsiders": two countries that are violating the West and feeling badly treated and now allied.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played a role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial interviews both presidents were saying that they hadn't even grasped the issue.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey abused the Russian military jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State talk at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin cheers Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV has been part of the narrowest trust of Putin for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for environment and transport matters.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in a statement of the Kremlin, it is said that without giving reasons, Putin ordered" "" "the release of Ivanovs from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who, since 2012, was Ivanovs's deputy, was named his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin website it says (in Russian) that he later was the protocol chef and staff leader of the government staff.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the government's main task to support your work as head of state with respect to bills and controls to implement your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the smiling faces convince?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">For a long time, Sergei Ivanov was one of the closest collaborators Vladimir Putin and worked as he did for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">During a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, few are convinced - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who once touted as a potential president - would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin cited on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said: "it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - to entrust placeable posts for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the State Security Service (KGB).</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was president of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was named his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of five people whom he most trusted.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once believed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become president of Russia, as a third term Putin had violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another close allies of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister, before being elected president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closing of the" "" "ceiling blower" "" "approaching each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>

<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 bevel ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensland crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all the witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate operation requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, nearly 79% of the entire deck deck is in place, and the last section of the deck today gets a concrete casting for the deck in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "Michael Martin, project manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said:" "" "the first lock represents a significant milestone for each bridge project." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of forward-looking high and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the street and its connection with the north tower in the expansion, we had to close the still existing gap on the north or land side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3%.</seg>

<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>

<seg id="9">The cheap apartments, however, can also arise in the continuance.</seg>

<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such surfaces but as much as 20 per cent of the apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="15">The left wants even harder constraints for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">No matter what, so Bratmann, a sharpening of the situation on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the concept of action is implemented, it will take care of additional tasks in the building management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the programme is not yet complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It's fascinating to see how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children don't go out to play outside, but rather prefer to spend their free time playing on screens has been lamented by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to TV, then on video games and finally limited to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course I refer to Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s (later created a series of cartoons, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop culture phenomena, interest in the release of the game decreased in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the server overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and nearly as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and, once they are found, "photographed" (using a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the madness and jumped into the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the "average" person restores each day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiograms, an app for Apple Watch, which pursues 35,000 users, informed the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of tracked people, who train every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who is playing Pokémon go - it only sees raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns for the health that people want to take for 30 minutes, "coming from the sofa" and "being active every day" hit deaf ears because many public messages are boring for health and come from people who look miserable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sport reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoor that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even make new friends on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As usual, there are also angry game spoilers that have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk around a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What's it?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough occurred.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit could already track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sports as this game does.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and use will fade in time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemons's success, however, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active will in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-fight title and overall the fifth, while she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her end result was shown and her long journey was ending at that moment.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>

<seg id="17">She expected a final exam in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace themselves after winning gold and silver in the single multi-fight inale of women in the gymnastics of the Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as an exclamation mark on the farewell celebration of the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted on having never planned the future during their long journey, it is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their floor exercises - containing their typical tumbling pass - is adapted to Latin American music, which would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl adopted by her grandparents as a little child and trained by trainer Aimee Boormans dam during a school excursion into the gym, trained in the Boorman, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, it has not lost a competitive competition, a winning series that will continue as long as Biles wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if Mustafina slightly led through two turns, the picture blurred.</seg>
<seg id="27">Floating beams and ground antennas - in which Biles holds the world title - was lurking.</seg>
<seg id="28">She resumed with 15,433 on the floating beam - and with a 15,933 on the floor still one on it.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman softly hugged her as she expected her brotherhood - a pure formality - and tears flocked on Biles shiny red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her book book, became reality.</seg>

<seg id="32">After her floor exercises, she threw out Kusshalls, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine in the gymnasium of women in the gymnastics and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984, and the USA has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, which inspired many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewish is and Madison Kocian, who is catholic, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one among female female female female female designers was an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year were Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic medalist and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they provided unexpected, yet masterful gynectic routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American, who won gold in an individual event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but we do not see gymnastics all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie were all beating the same way as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "", "because the next Olympics will only have four female gymnasts. it is also the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics are an expensive sport and Turner first line in private gymnastics that are maintained by parents who pay for the training, furnishing, travel, and hotel costs (for the trainers and their Turner and families). the list can be continued arbitrarily.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gymnastics lie in prosperous suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained her athletes since they started gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to offer to the assemblies of innumerable young girls, inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easily accessible gym training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">During my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban teenagers (mainly black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics that will make the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that motivates thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of Girl Power by holding the Olympic team golf and thank you for motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way, healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveler Ian Wright schabt for a guide his tongue at the dirtiest places of Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller undertook his immune system and litters of a serious test by leaking up some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk played his course on a euro note, a banister at Piccadilly Circus, a rinse button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before the lick off of each object he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he is getting involved.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was made into film under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea to lick off the flushing button of a train toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright talked with doctors and medical professionals about promoting intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left behind what he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his bowels by travelling through the world and ate strange and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public railroads to railway stations to flush-buttoning toilets, the task presented its immune system definitely below a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the film he said:" "" "already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and mud water." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was able to do justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His sample painting showed a luminometric rating of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the luminometric number of fresh washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet which he refused to lick off after her luminometric rating was over 4000 units while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and Finnish producer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "that comes close to the worst that I have dug in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more concious than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick it here because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the extraction of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "valios senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "" "we wanted to offer consumers something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We performed crazy brainstorming that ended up saying "Let us call Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I told him to lick, just like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others, with whom this was rather difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty leaks on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio from 2015, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria especially associated with the well-being of gastric and intestines and 58 percent said they should at least occasionally use products containing attached lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asocial family left their social housing after a deletion with a damage in the amount of £50,000 because it had terrorized its neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Treaticock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls were filled with holes, wooden planks were torn up, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is assumed that they are now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for the house management at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was an absolute nightmare for people and I think people don't have to live this way." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider since this property is probably considered as not so beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is likewise.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted on street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive cries, disputes and floods.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, got an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house which will be torn down under certain circumstances, old rubbish was found</seg>
<seg id="14">In the estate where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden planks were piled up</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and regularly calling the police</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing delogierte she and her partner forcibly off the estate this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw.</seg>

<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said it would have taken the family to cooperate with the local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house, to which the police were called in regular intervals, 20 years</seg>
<seg id="26">Rubbish and old toys were thrown down on the overgrown site of the church building.</seg>
<seg id="27">He added: "it is a shame that the tenant should arrange to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family, as delogiation is always the last step to consider Cornwall Housing.</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be horrible.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work done by my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and provided us with the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated." ""</seg>

<seg id="33">Workers of housekeeping will now have to evacuate garbage mountains that surround the house</seg>

<seg id="35">Skeldon received a fine, after having found guilty to the owner of a drug of class B in commercial recognition.</seg>

<seg id="38">Many room walls of the house were graffiti with graffiti.</seg>

<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021 the state election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because more stupid than so far it is not: summer holidays, heat and land election campaign - that is biting.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are supposed to be convinced by the election fighters, are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the holidaymakers in the country, on the way to Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not natives, so you can't choose the country day.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are some practical problems: during the holidays there are helpers, hang up posters, inflate air balloons, distribute flyers, and end up voices in the end.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign just close to the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say it at all, just started.</seg>

<seg id="13">How much newcomer AfD will cut off and what remains in the end of the coalition will be exciting.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one sees from his big posters.</seg>

<seg id="15">Since the speed limits were not complied with, the community also called for the measurement vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>

<seg id="21">Businessmen don't like to look into the cards.</seg>

<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from Göhner whether there could be a financial compensation, with the hint that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages arising from the renovation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties where something more generous has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">In all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>

<seg id="5">Volkswagen starts the second half of the year in the event of deliveries.</seg>
<seg id="6">In spite of its many brands and some well running markets, Europe's largest car manufacturer can continue to boast a plus in the course of the year.</seg>

<seg id="8">In July, the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles in July with 449100 cars than in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="9">In Western Europe alone, the second most important market in China, sales were 14 percent below the previous year's level.</seg>

<seg id="15">Big support for VW is the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="16">All in all, the primarily affected home brand of the Lower Saxony is further worsening by the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only a drop down of 0.9 percent to 3,37 million vehicles is available.</seg>
<seg id="17">Group sales manager Fred Kappler was able to advance sales splits from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time, 5.904 million worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had tampered with a software exhaust test.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany alone VW is calling some 2.5 million vehicles to retrofit into the workshops.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the course of retrofitting VW confirms that the conversion of cars has no negative effects.</seg>
<seg id="22">After retrofitting the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine output.</seg>
<seg id="23">After the changeover, the car maker will issue a "guaranteed" certificate, but do not speak of a "guarantee" as it was stated on Friday in business circles.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Solitary middle aged men love records.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you rush to the comment section to see him under the pseudonym NonAlleEnvelenMale Middle-old with harsh insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the frequently discussed revival of records is not based on a boom in millennials, who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but rather to Midlife-nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">For those who bought a record recently, all foresight is between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes of hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers hold their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog is a news report on TV, the camera would follow me as I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wear a modest gray suit and steppe wildly before I stand, hold my hands and say something better: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there still is a handful of fantastic record specialist shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55 I of Sister Ray (Number of data: two young women, three middle aged men) into Reckless Records (Number of data: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably around 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I already appreciate," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4.000 albums.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford than they appeared and buy items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late sixties, early seventies that appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought were too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "he agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and would like to spend time alone, and add:" "" "I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets can apply to the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and have been forced to buy their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "from the conversations that I have led, people usually discharged themselves so around 1998 or 1999 of their collection." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ some of the older customers accepted the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar record sleeves, of items that wake up happy gem memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says WEZ.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is an easy way to mentally engage.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "an employee flees from a record stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey conducted by the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a record last month had not yet heard them.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player whom they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record have no record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned as I smoother through a pile of Bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three middle aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came up here recently and said," I don't own record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead sound plate so I can put it on the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it happens definitely.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less music-like.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones who come in slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has devoted almost an entire floor to the records, has a lower audience than I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and middle aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts latest synthesizer and sexier pop, instead of experimental jazz drumbles from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but serious mental traumas are hard to detach when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the store for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It makes a window-shopping rather than a wholesale purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">It does not deserve much, therefore collecting records is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to hear music from a computer or other way, but the beauty of plates is... "it drives away with a dearest sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the impression to mustering jeans pants, I observe a group of young teenage girls who are grouped around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of records from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees them - maybe because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Although my research revealed that the results of YouGov are right, they, at least in record stores in Soho, have not taken into account the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They certainly do not spend their Thursday morning strolling through sheet stores of Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while avoiding the starchy gaze of an uncanny, 30-year-old false Moderator who raises no clueless middle-aged men over the shoulders.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle in which thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argue that the state should be allowed to submit 72 temporary shops where people within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy out of which no taxes would be paid and which contain a fire and sanitation risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-supported associations and other groups would not offer enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also led to the fact that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille ruled that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 temporary shops, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were absolutely understandable. "</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "the judge Jean-François Molla said that the grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely feeding people who" "" "live in extremely precarious conditions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by the tearing was the Jungle Book Kids' Café, which is operated in a non-profit way and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the kids' café.</seg>

<seg id="13">The two relief organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants were estimated on Friday that the number of thousands of people living in the jungle had risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number up to now - after a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's racers have to focus on the next generation of speed meters: in different federal states, including in Hessen and Brandenburg, new flash units are being tested, which should be particularly effective.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic Enforcement trailer of Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at accident areas, where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, at highway construction sites or to build bridges with temporary speed limits, there is often no need for infrastructure to ensure compliance with speed limits with a stationary speed heater.</seg>
<seg id="5">But a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Enforcement trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days during continuous measurement operation, the case data are transmitted encrypted over a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">With laser measuring technology, all vehicles can also be captured over several tracks at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits as well as drive-through bans according to time, lane and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at the 7-er rugby race led to an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the Fijis form on Thursday evening when they were defeated at the Deodoro Stadium in Rio with a result of 43-7.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji shared a master class in handling, side-stepping, back-back, line running and raw power to win Gold - her first Olympic medal in any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was missed by the not too bad price of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back to it in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of that, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Briton tomorrow will hang a gold medal around his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former head for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they just lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This hatch will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderful and let the attacks drop GBs out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. on as if one would run in running buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 upwards when Osea Kolinisau echoed in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With another four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right-hand corner.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB has hardly embraced the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A sneaky Tackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa to score a third gate, but it only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, jasa Veremalua found a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new member and there was still a minute of playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vbreatho Ravouvou tortured by further weak tacklings of the UK team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while the UK still stares.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is the way it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB carried out basic modifications at half-time and closed the fijian gap... for about four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova went through after a brilliant play by Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Sea Sulphans, whose fans sang, flags wave and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame placed the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Pfiff sounded, the Fijis hugged and the UK kicked down in the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day, Fiji Japan defeated in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa into a scarce semi-finals match from the race - Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton interrupted the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate under the post in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no more emotesque gold than with these games, and that's what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first strokes to the last, 220 hard pieve who went into history Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in her golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only those who were sitting at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the response of the coach Robin Williams was present when she rued to the second Olympic old in the second without a tax woman in a row, the first women in the history of British sport that laid such a benchmark.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, after all, their 39.ter unused disposition, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant female athletes, gliding over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the type of triumph in its entirety.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers who make up the difference and nobody was more helpful than the coach who did not know 30 months ago whether he would survive this day at all than he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which is operable and that was what they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit of the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if that is the right term at all.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to get better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was hospitalized and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of the victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-striped tomorrow with something more than just talking and trying to handle his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "panning, who was a Captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said," "" "I was an emotional wreck this week. that's something extreme, but it means so much." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It only repeats how much I and Helen and Robin worked for.</seg>

<seg id="3">"" "the association is considered" "" "exemplary" "" "as" "" "Bavarian" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="4">A small Frankish drinking water-purpose association as a model for the large water producers.</seg>

<seg id="6">Little later, the water forum of the government of Lower Franconia praised the association.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "the work of the veitenstein group is" "" "far as exemplary" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="8">Behind all this, Rupert Göller, who was 31 years in the Zweckverband für Employees, stands for 28 years as managing director.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was now retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The water-water-association of the Veitensteingruppe, based in Kottendorf, municipality Breitbrunn, transports approx. 150,000 cubic meters of water annually and provides 32 places and hamlet with approximately 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">Member churches are the municipalities of Kirchsheim, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are also water supply contracts for other towns and communities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairwoman, Breitbrunn Bürgermaster Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was set up as a water goalkeeper in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zweckverband in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from the installation and maintenance work on office and organizational activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergencies on weekends," "" "said the chairman." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">As an outstanding event, she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain (1994), land purchases in the area of the new fountain (1998) and compensation of the farmers, the repurchase of a central computer control system (2004) and the repurchase of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was no standstill, and there was always something new added because water was the most important food for drinking water and drinking water.</seg>
<seg id="17">In their laudation, she commended Göllers faithful, reliable and correct service over the age of 31.</seg>
<seg id="18">He used a lot of lifeblood for his water-purpose association and he really lived the water-purpose association as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein Group to the nitrate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Franconia district.</seg>
<seg id="20">For that he received a great deal of recognition and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller, for his part, praised Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best waterman and he was a faithful boy.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">From his point of view, he described Brunnenbau and the restructuring of the Zweckverband.</seg>
<seg id="25">The biggest challenge and the most difficult task, however, were the rupture of the pipe at the elevated tank at Kirchicious on January 3rd.</seg>
<seg id="26">We had to work here at minus 17 degrees all night so that the towns could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">The supply of new brunn can also be maintained once only because it filled the high container of Pettstadt with hoses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The management of the drinking water purpose association was handed over to Daniel Sturmer from Lauter who succeeds Rupert Göller.</seg>

<seg id="2">The crisis-laden and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared of additional costs in millions of millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that the industry threatened from green electricity production are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains in the release of the renewable energy conversion in the existing plants for so-called self-current production in the German steel industry, "said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung "(WAZ, Friday Edition).</seg>

<seg id="8">Gabriel told the WAZ, there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>

<seg id="17">The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis of 2008.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation worsened further, when the world's largest producer of products in China threw massive steel onto the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies to dumping price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring the situation has somewhat relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, the import duties have an impact on import steel. on the other hand, economic prospects in China have brightened up.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainably the price recovery is.</seg>
<seg id="23">German industry primus Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, the prices would have stagnated again.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry reacts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">Last but not least ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">Around 86000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, the German steel producers are cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.</seg>
<seg id="29">With 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year's month, as the German Trade Union announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a short increase in May, the quantity produced went back to the second month in a row.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent below the previous year's figure.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the coming months, the association expects an increase in output due to an improved order situation.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing is good for seniors</seg>
<seg id="2">Ursel Kipp has already accompanied her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, she finished music in the school choir, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and more alive, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good for her health and mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">Singing is a great hobby for seniors, from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German senior league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular gatherings, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "to speak and organise, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For doing so, seniors train a deep and controlled respiration.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand his lungs will not get out of the powder as quickly as in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">When it comes to receiving the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">For older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Association of the Senior Citizens Organisations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations joint singing had a much higher significance, it belonged to everyday life, both at school and in leisure time, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening of songs in older people awakens many memories, often connected with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and particularly melodies, even dementia sufferers degenerate long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, the head also requires special performance, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time focusing on one's own voice and rhythm and adapting to the other singers - that's a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just elderly people who live alone are doing so, not only concentrating on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The sense of self-esteem is also growing through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I stay long for something, I get better and grow beyond myself - this experience reinforces.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing are enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate, even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - in 50 singing people, who hears a sound next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the suitable offer Seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a seniors "choir, one can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer an overview of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or church leader directly.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those who do not have access to the internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help in the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you want to sing, you should definitely join a choir, Hackler recommends.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="8">As a stronghold they won't get gold, the audience broke out into a storm of applause.</seg>
<seg id="9">But there are many other sportsmen who go to the start despite the doping past at the Olympic Games in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here an overview:</seg>

<seg id="12">He had already been banned two times for doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).</seg>
<seg id="13">Since its inception, the Olympic Champion of 2004 and former World Champion has been running even faster than before, he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9,80 seconds and is considered to be the greatest challenger of Usain Bolt.</seg>

<seg id="11">During the detonation in the vicinity of the popular bathing beach Patong, a taxi driver was injured following police instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani on the south-eastern coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban employee.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities in a bouquet of flowers, the blast set had gone into the air in front of the territory of the coast police.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast as well as in Chumphon on the south-east coast demanded several injured.</seg>
<seg id="15">One goes from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "the bomb attacks carry the same handwriting," "" "said army general Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning before journalists." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "we expect it to act as a co-ordinated attack." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">It is too early to express himself on possible motives - but it is probably a matter of the deeds of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern typical of the bomb attacks by Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist uprising movement or with international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is only local sabotage that is limited to restricted areas and provinces," "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It is rather assumed that the bombs were imposed by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">The authorities would have received intelligence on upcoming attacks in the south of the country in recent days - however, they did not have been informed of the exact time and places.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police instructed their officials across the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand, there are repeatedely smaller bombings, but they are mostly not directed against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin is a palace used for years by Thailands King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">After the well-stocked bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its website to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla, as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="30">After confrontations between security forces and Muslim populations, there will be no necessary trips to these provinces.</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday were followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military great influence over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country was heading for stability, an improvement in economic conditions and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military junta, which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest, is committed to restoring the kingdom again to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military has not been able to get a grip on the revolting uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Just a year ago, in Bangkok, 20 people were killed in a stroke at a stroke at a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the bloodiest attack of the country's recent history.</seg>

<seg id="6">In social networks, Habte became the viral internethite.</seg>

<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries known.</seg>

<seg id="19">At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney the run of Eric Moussambani provided media attention.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf, the waste water charge will increase again at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a large-scale calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf is then at 4.37 euros per cubic meter.</seg>
<seg id="4">As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, in the approval of the household by the municipal council of Kulmbach, it was found that undercover for this sewage treatment plant was running.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal foundations, the market of Kasendorf is obliged to operate the plants cost-effectively.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of 1 October 2016, citizens and industrial and industrial companies from Welfare, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the wallet.</seg>
<seg id="7">The cost increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Director of Directors Herbert Schmidt showed the panel, a new calculation of the fees for the sewage treatment facilities of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period between October 2016 and September 2020, over- or undercover from the previous calculation period must also be equalled.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt explained the grave fee increases by means of relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Due to the low distribution basis, expenses for necessary repairs would have a serious impact on several thousand euros.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, in the back-ahead calculation period, renovation and repair expenditure in all three installations had a considerable degree not least due to their age.</seg>
<seg id="14">The complex in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the facilities for world meal, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt indicated that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the wastewater treatment plant in Azendorf due to damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the pump plant Welfare, the almost 20 years old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from the ground up. after almost 20 years of operation, the first sewage pond had to be evacuated, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation option had to be installed in order to comply with the water-legal requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "these extraordinary expenses were accompanied by the ongoing maintenance and maintenance costs that must be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which were still below the current level in the years 2011 / 2012.</seg>

<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its Filtertool, it makes Snapchat about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders on the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are blooded, self-rotating tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All offences get to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have voiced criticism in the past when they were accused of promoting the App Blackface or promoting white skin as beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week some Users proposed a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "Yellow face."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday, with reports of The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it would have deactivated the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as a homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of injurious clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widely spread over the photos, was" "" "hurtful and mild to say" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian caricature and filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow face has been pulled into the decreasing extremity.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and devices that we all hold in our hands.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats large audiences of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older opponents - could expect to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one of Snapchats filters generates an image that is insulting for a user, "it is much more difficult for such things to remain unnoticed than it was earlier," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, who works as product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete their Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay on medium and in a telephone interview she said she believes that racial controversy will reflect a lack of diversity in the settings practices at Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the large part white, only male leadership and finished their article with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their staff, so that they can make such decisions," "" "said the Chinese-American Zhu," "" "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but are not in positions where they feel safe or well to say." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that has largely left Snapchat unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, it refused Snapchat to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a HR officer who concentrates on underrepresented demographic groups and on internal integration efforts.</seg>

<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than permitted the actual states on the ground, announced an inquiry committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of Republican members of the Joint Committee, Intelligence Committee and the Complementary Commitee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command Intelligence Analyst who reported how superiors changed their assessments on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, short of Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "intelligence information typically picked up by high-level CentCom commanders recorded a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism as the actual states were allowed on site and were consistently positive than analyses of other intelligence services," "" "a newspaper article cited the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "what happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses are presented to our political leaders," "" "noted Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">The management mistakes in the Centcom extend to the top point of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct indication that government tips have given instructions under Obama to change the reports, it shows how analysts face pressure from their superiors to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command Press Releases, comments and statements made in front of the Congress were much more positive than the facts" "" "stated the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mozambique could already begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigation, it's so clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, Central Command has changed the intelligence reports to reduce the risk of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force into their lives after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights during the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are underway by the Chief Inspector of the Department of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which agree with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "in 2014 and 2015, CentCom created an overly limited process for creating intelligence evaluations about ISIL and the Iraqi security services," "" "announced the highest ranking Demokrat in the Comintern, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process," "" "Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "harmed the morality of analysts and" "" "gave excessive amounts of room for dissenting opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats stated that there were no indications of intervening at the White House at the Centcom analysts regarding a" "" "certain political opinion" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "the preliminary results of the investigation were published on Tuesday by" "" "The Daily Beast" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's Chief Inspector, who was taken up after complaints by Centcom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">T. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on any reports of the Congress, while the investigation of the Inspector General is still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also admitted that" "" "experts sometimes have divergent views on the interpretation of complex data, and that intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcomed a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful campaign of air under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the allegations of last year have raised the question to what extent President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of more than ten years ago, when a Centcom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document on how the then government under George W. Bush looked forward to the recommendations of many analysts, only a small occupation force in Iraq, and little time went to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the revolt against the current reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, Mr. Hooker's team stated that contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these temporary refineries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, this recognition was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms at that time, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature because of his excessive positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel in Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel steady and unavoidable, a rapid relay competition between competition and pursuit.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is like the olympic torch itself a burning rod, which is passed from the crossbow to the swimmers to the gymnast for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbor in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Lecovery or the quarrel between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympics and a women's flock with dimples, could well have been among these well-known names, who are sent to Prime Time, built up by sponsors and feel-good TV ads, if he would be a swimmer, turner or even fencer.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the olympic trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shade are the sports that are not universally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breaststroke and may it rule for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I think it should be modest for my particular darling, then let me draw your attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, it became so sparsely noticed for the last 16 years that many people I had questioned did not know that it is an Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to competition, it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had had an athlete until 2012, who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians are inclined to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline has a certain outsider, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than the one for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I'm not an expert, but only a dary enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of its never-ending impact - but also the Grazie of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that it essentially combines.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Aspiring winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They are rated according to the official Olympiad according to design, difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists must continue in their quest for gold, faster, up and over, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes down and back, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They hunt not only the finish line or the exit wall, but in the television transmission also another heighted objective: the world or the Olympiarekord.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented pursuit is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir up a spectator into tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel a bit tiring when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.</seg>
<seg id="34">Here too there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant suspension of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final rounds of the women will be held on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00 onwards.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase of consciousness can only be achieved through the fear and objectiveness of male athletes - as the male US Turner proposed recently, according to The Wall Street Journal - Mr. Dooley expects his new fans to breathe.</seg>

<seg id="6">Over the past ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government were shaking the country and expanding into ever more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the response of the government was ruthless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses testified that police fired and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos on the protests that are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security people hit young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "the head of the UN Human Rights authority is now calling for a detailed investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country together and will become even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, the leader of the Horn of Africa, the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism across the region, particularly in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but an example of democracy - human rights organizations continually led repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted and dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven to the expanse of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and do not have any other options other than protesting, it breaks out," "" "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">One generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from soil use to stranglehold in the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been enforced more or less in recent years, can exploit the turbulence and be able to arm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness will now explode under the surface after years of exposure to Hinköchlarns.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media because cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government unlocks the access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still can communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians told them that they gathered to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons the Amhara, who come from Ethiopia mainly from Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this too is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are there to co-ordinate under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, accounting for around 6 per cent of the population, dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "the third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death on a non-publicized disease in 2012 for 17 years Ethiopia's prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to manipulate opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this basic skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively obscure reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia experienced such an uproar was in 2005 after thousands protested against elections, which, according to analysts, was apparently pledged by the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the ensuing raids, many protesters were killed, even though there were less than in recent months and that time of unrest has passed quite rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But evidently this did not prevent the intensification of the internal misconception of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters in Gondar, an amharan city, attacked by Tigray and the hatred towards the Tigray is becoming more and more common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced that it has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim that Obama was founded IS "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump attempted to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his repeated statement that President Obama and Hillary Clinton had not been the "founder" of the terrorist group Islamic State seriously.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification threw new questions on the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidates, whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehensibly with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also entails his comrades who endeavour to take him in protection during an eventful period, into the peculiar position of explaining statements he could not have meant at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">Having made the suggestion at a election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump rusted back in relation to the allegation on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was contrary to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation was totally serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama would destroy ISIS, the Republican candidate wanted to know nothing about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism unleashes Mr. Trump, while trying to steer the focus of his campaign because of falling demand values on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this topic again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech dull.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he criticised himself when he said that the Russians were to hack Mrs Clinton's emails, but later he explained, "Of course, I meant the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic borders in politics and then to call back on demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive, and then" clarify "depending on how the reaction falls out." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert, who observes the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has accepted an even more corrosive tone, as his surveys have continued to decline.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris, which was published on Friday, showed a leading edge in North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado, and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally trying not to excuse himself for his provocative pronouncements, he often blames his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humor.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is increasingly focusing on the attention during the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump Scherze has brought his loyal companions into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him, regardless of how provocatively his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent advocates, gave himself great trouble to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview of Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "" "Mr. Giuliani said about the accuracy of Mr. Trumpur's statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had established the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown small organization, he called it back-brokers, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, where Mrs. Clinton served as foreign minister, allowed ISIS to spread out by being aggressive under control of the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="26">In front of the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of roaming around on each of his words and being prejudiced against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he ridiculed the" "" "poor, poor" "" "television experts who try to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a foaming cafe in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash, which had no Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices were pushed out of his Bedford Avenue Ladenfront.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Soap Cherie business, replacing Verb in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Local people considered it the last loss in a genetically modified city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is exempt and Verb is now a soap business."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is a change, then it's also new-finding.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revitalized Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile to the north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the club is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old café, the owner and managing director of the new café.</seg>
<seg id="12">He began working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a client offered him to provide funds for a new job, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, kept a great deal.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old Verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">There are sandwiches with bacon and cheese on the menu and there are garnishing like capers and sauerkraut.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural rice dishes.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café serves no more beer, but there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months, Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"many old customers were also driven out by prizes from Williamsburg," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg before and visited the club regularly.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after she moved to Greenpoint she would take the path.</seg>
<seg id="27">After the verb had closed, she gave up the coffee drink for a while, she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "I realized that it was at the coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked," "" "she said." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland's sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland harks will only get up to 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely the Greenland shark floats along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it comes on average just 1,220 meters wide.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes to it, the five meter long animal accelerates at a satte 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">But this lifestyle shaped by slowness seems to be a patent for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" in any case from a Greenland shark who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," comments Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock this life span that means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is true that the evolutionary biologist has long believed that Greenland's hair will become stony.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's sharks are difficult to observe, after all they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in the winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland's hair.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her slow-turpentine was, as she pointed out, six animals with one transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">The loot nevertheless makes this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Maybe they hunt sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice-sea and look for cadaver, which torches from higher water-layers downwards.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland sharks which caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the biggest 502 centimetre was measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the carbon-14 method the lentil nucleus of the sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens arises before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein will not be renewed later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a strikingly high carbon-14 in the lentil nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s, when atomic weapons retrieved larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">With 220 centimetres of length of the third smallest animal, the lentil nucleus, on the other hand, contained a low surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday during its investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All larger Greenland sharks on the other hand had normal carbon-14-quantities in its lentil nucleus, which arises through cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact the carbon-14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493 centimetre-long Greenland shark, while the record shark might be 392 years old with 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to classify an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland's hair with the multiplication is obviously at least one and a half centuries time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is no coincidence that such methane gas lives mainly in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland Whale, whose bacon at the neck was a 120 year old harpoon tip, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the living animals often runs on asparagus.</seg>
<seg id="36">They mature later - and age more slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are also often very big.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than at a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible," "" "explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal should, on the other hand, invest its resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">With the lifting of sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trading rate between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="3">Since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, the interest in Russian companies on businesses in the country grew strongly, the ambassador announced.</seg>

<seg id="5">"" "of course, the further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," "" "said Dzhagaryan." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">The altar boys from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch, St. Anna, were on the way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Four stages were dealt with together.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time to the next Romance journey of all the minions in two years, the St. Anna's round of ministries is determined to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and one finally decided for the bishop's city of Freiburg, where, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy on the Freiburg cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis of Bittelbronn, and Gruol, and Haigerloch, and the rooms of the saints, were in the way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before, Pastor Storey sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim crosses and parted pilgrimages.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb we drove by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a Muenster Lady of Our Lady stands and so the Pilgrimage from Münster was started.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening, accompanied by a short impulse with different prayers, songs and lyrics.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the Minis on field crossings, chapels or churches repeatedly stopped to sing together a song out of specially compiled pilgrims song booklet.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the overnight stays parish homes of the local parishes were available.</seg>
<seg id="12">Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller were responsible for a tasty and energizing dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the second day we passed Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">After that, one stepped up the stage to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting stretch of the road, but at first some 500 metres of altitude had to be climbed and then climbed.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the Badweiher in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter it went to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">Visibly relieved and happy the Minis arrived in the later afternoon at the Freiburg Minster and went through the gate of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a small impulse, God was given thanks.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the evening mass in Münster, the Minis who arrived at the pilgrim's destination were greeted by Kooperator Markus Obert.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day was still time for the Breisgau Metropolis.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon we went by train back to Horb.</seg>

<seg id="2">Schottlands Callum Skinner raced last night in the men team sprint in the Velodrom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow embarked on a role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy made himself Eigen. the Junkund made the legend proud when he rushed home to take home a victory from the favorites New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they scored only a modest sixth place at the London Underground World Championships in March, despite the resignation of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement created a gap that kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Scotsman that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindi, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy won - and Skinner won a qualifying round in the qualifying rounds, but the New Zealanders won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hindi fell short after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation when Hindu drove in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked at his position as a BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hindi when they climbed onto the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it's a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an Olympic champion in the final round and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 on the site of Kenny and Hoys Hindu admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the train.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no appeal by England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Hindi said:" "" "it feels like the whole UK flags on the tribune like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We got so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win back at the Olympics again.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If that is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we are expecting successful five days in velodrome.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kenny it is in the realm of the possibility that he repeated Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a contest.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for British sport; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same by Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny will take part in the sprint that will start today and will go for three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "" "I just enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a little lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "Hindi said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-mile race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was at 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday he had contested with officers before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">Laura Trott, Joanna Rowel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavies advanced in the world record time in 4: 13,260 in the respective women's competition, which will be continued tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on his strong rail team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a medal at medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly exceptional presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">Dramas played in the background, such as Shane Sutton's resignation in April in the midst of sex and mobbing reproaches as well as retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">But when one looks at the first evening of the competition in the velodrome, it looks as if the legendary reputation of GBs, which reached its climax at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium melts of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workstations of workers - are at stake, as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and thereby cancels all delivery contracts, such as the supplying energy company announced.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies for the operation of the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy set for 20 years will expire in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs at the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effects, as the melt mill consumes around 10 percent of the entire electricity generation Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa closed the Point Henry melt which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The enamel of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the long-lasting speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium joinery with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three more owners will terminate their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The facility is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL expects the plant to continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity through the melt," announced the company.</seg>
<seg id="14">AGL continued to say that the contracts were so-called "hedging transactions," which would have come into effect from November 2016.</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12 month notice period so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "from this point, AGL expects the contracts to contribute to revenues in the fiscal year 17," "" "said the current supplier." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on AGL revenues from the GJ 18 are currently limited by forecasting the strong futures markets for wholesale prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL announced that it had already depreciated the value of the contracts in its annual subscription amounting to $187 million in "anticipation of a dismissal."</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "Alcoa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts, the" "" "ability of Alcoas... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt" "" "did not interfere." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said that 2010 has concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, who should have come into effect from November this year even though it is still a statement guilty of why it resigned from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Due to the poor economic conditions in the industry, analysts are warning about the potential closure of the Portland melt plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to statements by analysts at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses some 600 megawatts each year to consume around 900 MW of electricity each year.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and the fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian Jenner clan, Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the U.S. Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on her Instagram account.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the view of this cover brought me to tears," wrote Kendall.</seg>
<seg id="5">The cover of the cover was followed by a bizarre (or simply keeping Up with the Kardashyan's), which shows the entire Kardashian Jenner family (with the exception of Rob and Caitlyn problem cases as well as in the presence of the most popular show biz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest): they all planned a surprise party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This represents the cliché plot of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacarrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of Kardashians has begun with certainty.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's big sister Kim likes her, as regards the vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for herself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that looks more like a picture book than a fashion magazine, the issue pulls a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista have been advertising from the 832 pages of the tome 615 pages advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The revelation of his cover star is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years images of the magazine have been filtered before official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "in recent years there have been clearly more" "" "celebrities" "" "than" "" "models that are celebrities" "" "on the cover." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar Award Winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the small chance that Ms. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "" "" breakthrough model "" "" of her generation - falls under the former category, she is in good company. "" "</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if everything is true to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, was one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, Jenny's success doesn't like everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With reality TV history, Jenners was always a little tense in the fashion world.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June, the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticised and called them "the mistletoe of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings were again high when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But running around on the missmut seems to pass by the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">She is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">She runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your primer of Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">You and all her sisters are selling pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.</seg>

<seg id="15">A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then we found a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>

<seg id="2">Companies that earn money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, try to circumvent ad blocking, a "cat and mouse play."</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blockings on its desktop site, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it informed that users could update their filters in the program to re-block advertising on the social network.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop site would change coding in terms of advertisements to make it more difficult to identify what part of the advertising site is advertising.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it found a new way to bypass the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a blog post the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of hin-and-back struggle between the ailing open source community and the converters has been underway since the invention of display blocker," and that it is possible that Facebook comes soon with a new solution.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media enterprise has entered the fight is a strong indication of how worrying indicator blowers have become industry.</seg>

<seg id="9">With 1.03 billion users of active users who access their mobile devices on Facebook, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertising revenues.</seg>

<seg id="4">The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">A woman lay down in the dark "in an act of despair" on the street and were hit by several cars, the police declared in Vaud.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is obvious that a Swiss woman, at the age of 49, who was overdriven by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself.</seg>

<seg id="11">Was a collision avoidable?</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "this is something the prosecutor has to decide," "" "said Hofstetter." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not held accountable.</seg>
<seg id="14">In each of the two cases - where a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian walks in the middle of the night on the highway as it was called in the newspaper.</seg>

<seg id="16">The 22-year-old victim had drunk and was unconscious on the street, took the judgment.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the projections of a new NASA climate model Venus was probably habitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus by means of tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have rejected similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and yet slowly moved on.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably showed more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protected from rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "in the GISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus is exposed for almost two months," "" "said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution that previously thought of planets scientists.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably habitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billion years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor burnt out of ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their hydro-gene lagged behind only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide returned with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that as we know it today.</seg>

<seg id="3">The new data will help astronomers understand why stars in the star cluster rotate in different rates, and in which context the rotation periods are associated with planetary formation.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other star brands, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>

<seg id="1">Olympic 2016: chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekova and Adrian Geiinski are the first doping cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Caught: because of a positive doping test, weight lifter Adrian Geishinsky cannot start from Poland in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.</seg>
<seg id="4">A caught athlete would have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh day of competition, the first official doping cases have become known in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese swimmers in Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter-obstacle in Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Geishinsky have been positively tested in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the start of the already critically-eyed athletics competitions these messages come to an end.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen, the uretic hydrochlorothiazide had been demonstrated last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday afternoon, the International Sports Court (CAS) confirmed the expulsion of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday the 18-year-old had occupied fourth place in the final over 100 m of butterflies, only about 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen would have allowed to take part in the 50 m free-style runs.</seg>
<seg id="11">The International Olympic Committee (IOC) asked for an opening of the B Trial Chamber and a hearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "the national association takes the matter" "" "very seriously and requires Chen's full co-operation in the investigations," "" "said Xinhua from a communication:" "" "we will cooperate with the International Sports Court of CAS and will accept the judgement." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history no longer the IOC, but the CAS for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also in the night of Rio the news leaked at Danekova, the 33-year-old went on the offensive.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "said the Bulgarian TV station BNT." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "she was innocent," "" "The only explanation could be dietary supplements," "" "explained the athletic woman." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, the banned substance should be the blood doping agent EPO.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekova was suspended for the time being, according to BNT, the B-sample should also have been positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojko Borisov immediately reported on the issue of the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "I don't understand why the athletes do not pull the right conclusions," "" "he said," "" "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have been excluded." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, all weight lifters from the chronically doped nation must not participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday the case "Adrian Geiinski" was also known, the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg, like his brother Tomasz had previously tested positive for the anabolic steroid nandrolon three days before.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both deny taking, however, both must not start in the class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before the start of the athletes, especially the case of Danekova is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The world association IAAF prohibited the entire Russian team up to an exception for systematic doping at the start, as well as the transfer nation of Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In swimming sports, the former offences in China also ensured fierce disputes between the athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">So the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic Champion Sun Yang harsch.</seg>
<seg id="28">"sun Yang pinkelt lila."</seg>
<seg id="29">"when I see the podium more than 200 m of freestyle, I want to hand it over," said Lacourt in French radio.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun was also at the heart of a confrontation with the Australian Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I have no time and no respect for doping fraudsters," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Sun had been positively tested with the Chinese Championships in 2014 for the stimulant Trimetazidin, but only had to wait for a three month lock.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: so perfide blackmail chipper your ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Blackmail programmers are currently targeting companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey conducted by the malware rescue specialists Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany, 40 percent of the questioned companies in the past twelve months were at least once, in part multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany nearly 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims readily paid the ransom demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of Malwarebytes to attack in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially blackout ransom is significantly higher than in private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently witnessing an alarming fast evolution of the malware," "" "explains Malwarebytes leader Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the painting programs were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">First, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks quickly happened in the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim, searches for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or database files, as well as files and videos archives.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the Ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the final key code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, where private users have the personal photo database at stake, companies are dealing with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production still stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage is higher when a ransomware strikes.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the German companies affected reported sales losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely break the business activity, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany several hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims: don't pay, you only support the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay will recover their data.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers, it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in view of a standstill in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, F-Secure researchers have investigated the user interfaces and contact with the blackmail and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain to their victims via chat, how they can pay via Bitcoin, set free-to-access support websites or decrypt sample files for free.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private persons are redeemed for payments of a few hundred Euros, companies must partly negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums in order to get their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming more and more professional and share the work, explains safety expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware about within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">It is more likely that there are three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software toolbox to the real blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The malware kits now developed by buying malware from itself, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included in delivery is an adaptation tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmasts are then looking for further hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the forums on the underground, buys the set of one criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually the criminals employ spammers with spreading," "" "Wisniewski explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now known for many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 per cent of the corporate IT managers in the Malwarebytes questionnaire trust to be able to repel ransomware by means of file back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful earnings, the offenders threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," "" "explains Malwarebytes leader Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">This means that the potential for damage is even higher than before, depending on the type of data.</seg>
<seg id="42">In future, the perpetrators could henceforth take completely new targets on the internet of things on the grain.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackerkonferenz, Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter the activation of such a blocked heating could be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of the heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">In the small HR-V honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V seems to be rather small, passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect, only the cockpit-top is something off.</seg>

<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like cinema chairs and thus offer storage space, which is 1,24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The trunk is well loaded, but the load height is 650 mm higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel engine with 88 kW / 120 hp speeds up the HR-V very powerfully thanks to torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">He should do his job a little quieter though.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gratifying.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine: a 1.5-liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">A four-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort." ""</seg>

<seg id="19">The security systems include the City emergency braking assistant (works up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "the collision warner sometimes irritates because he evaluates many obstacles as" "" "approaching objects" "" "when maneuvering." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote-light assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the smart speed controller responds to traffic signs detection and throttles the speed if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="23">But the full connectivity is only available for the top features: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI ports lie under the armrest and are therefore something awkward to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The roughly 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel is fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who don't want to invest so much will get the petrol station from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips for sleeping disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening, one walks around forever, at night one is awake for hours, in the morning is already far from the wake-up ring no more to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, you are in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleep problems manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many causes behind them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Wear, member of the board of the German Society for Sleep Management and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you can see below, however, is the Insomnia, i.e. a dorsal and dormant disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just the passage of sleep feels many people as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German house doctor association with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">Sleep disorder is not infrequent expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is often common in a depression," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors condition each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, those who have a herniated disc, can sleep well, wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to worry about everyday problems and worries, there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I go to the doctor with sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are affected by the day should go to the doctor, advises her.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments like stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate the sleep disorder, it is important to find out its causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Behavioral changes include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or also medicines - classic bedablation tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquired.</seg>
<seg id="22">Dormant Sleep Medicine is hardly available in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary nursing centre at the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">For this reason, in case of problems with sleeping problems, one should contact the family doctor at first, advises her.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified by examining whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep or what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For the examination in sleep laboratory medicine, for example, in snoring with breathing spouts, in case of sleepiness, sleepwalkers or if you do not find the cause of a sleep disorder, Fietze says.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is not necessary to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "only please do not take a nap," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After the cladding, one goes to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes in the body, one carries a nose-goggles, a chest strap and a feeler on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">A camera also records the sleeping ends on the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws where you can put on a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Start counts: regular sleep and uptime, not too long in bed, don't sleep for too long, don't watch TV for sleep, avoid drinking alcohol and don't look at the clock at night - then you start to expect immediately, and that's not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="4">Now the former DSV-athlete Markus Deibler has put himself in front of his ex-team-mates who stood in the critique of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in a country where an Olympic champion receives 20,000 €bonus and a jungle king of 150,000 €should no one wonder about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote in the night to Friday on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="6">The funding system in swimming sports is bad, whereas doping controls are very good.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "with this we cannot compete with countries that promote very much and do not see or even operate on the subject of doping." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "I don't say that the controls should be set here," "" "he explained." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">If he wanted to make a comeback, he would have to be registered nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping agency Deutschland (NADA).</seg>
<seg id="10">This is exactly how you should keep it with countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "those who cannot control a certain time before WM / OS by independent controllers of WADA / FINA must not participate," "" "says the election Hamburg, who meanwhile operates an ice cream." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">Professional thieves at Dusseldorf Airport</seg>
<seg id="3">Civilian victims of the Düsseldorf police took the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">The suspects had committed several bags and luggage steels as bande.</seg>
<seg id="5">At 21.30, civil servants at the airport Düsseldorf saw a band known as police officers from past theft crimes.</seg>
<seg id="6">The two women and two men had committed several offences since the middle of July this year and were in a common, labour-friendly and very professional manner.</seg>
<seg id="7">The specialists of the Criminal Investigator 34 can demonstrate four acts to the thieves who had travelled to Germany specifically for the crime of crimes committed in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="8">They had captured over 15,000 Euros in total.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a couple of lime trees, in between, another cobblestone pavement: the Riga Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain doesn't seem like that at first sight, but the police force them to the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If one walks along the road from the east to the west, one passes on playgrounds, a fresher kindergarten and a bio shop.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "someone" "" "ugly!" "" "sprayed on the façade of a grey house." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Compared to a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, it is already being built: until 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "article about this" "" "trendy neighborhood" "", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, is, however, preferred in recent weeks with burning cars." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the inhabitants have leases, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin Interior Senator Henkel has spoken out several times for the police action against the project, the area referred to as "no-go zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On June 22, the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers were evacuated, according to official statements, with 30 to 40 officers and three crews on the ground, locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown house owners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearing was illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers withdrew from sympathisers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk vorm späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the building projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left-hand violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who mostly attracts three children, is generously annoyed by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house projects they share the care of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a Kiez, who wanted mostly police protection from vandalizers left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, which the Berlin interior senator and the police force between house occupiers and their neighbours, obviously does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class neighborhood, which today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and a high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">House occupations and the resulting residential projects have long been part of the neighbourhood: in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Straße in the vicinity of the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was evacuated under a large police force in a real road Battle, many of the projects were legalized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the city district has become a magnet for tourists and electors from all over the world in recent years: with them, residents from the GDR times and former house occupants share their neighbourhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also reflected in the rents that have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development: they can be seen on thrown panes or freshly painted facades, which were thrown with color bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other road was mentioned this year as often in the words" "" "left-autonomous violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason for not all neighbours to consider this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as body injury are according to statistics, almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the offences are made up of factual damage, which tend to make new buildings and newly renovated houses more tenly.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived for 17 years in a tenement house next to the disputed 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">When it comes to acts of violence, it is important: people in the 94 are their neighbours, they were certainly not.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars no longer give it any longer in the rigs.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has been deliberately drawn to Riga - and remains.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is why it was so important that the residents get back their street: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all of a sudden claimed the sovereignty over the part of the city.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the street will continue to be taken away: faceless new buildings in former construction gaps that displace the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "that's ultimately property condominiums that are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well frequented here live here," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"I can't approve violence and destruction."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do if someone else hears?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for the drawn-out, who annoy himself with colour bombs: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who draws, should be aware of this - just like someone who pulls into a pub area that can complain badly about noise there.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new Refugee Officer</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in the field of integration and organisation.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the Refugee Officer for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social educator supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working group refugee aid, administration, authorities and who else is involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine Customer from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deuschle is now there, the experienced pleasures of wool, which above all has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">So some - less ridiculously than rather targeted on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">Looking for an administrative professional with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, is an experience of experience in the pleasures of pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, Annika Deuschle means.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organisation, work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent vacancy for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine Customer that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers are standing at Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection provision.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these properties must be borne by the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Council of Governors to the Commune and Jobcenters.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">In fact, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far it doesn't work, so it is dependent on private apartments, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common apartments need to be emptied, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are placed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customers and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed lead, there are internships, apprenticeships, school grounds, one-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be undamaged or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reported Regine Customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help homeowners do charitable work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community will result in a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People must develop a feeling of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need offers like sport, contacts with locals and, above all, language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So the administration and the volunteers also jump here.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is crucial that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "you need to explain to the refugees that it is just and they can bridge the time wisely, for example with language courses." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever develops the feeling that he cannot help in Urbach should not work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">The work of Deuschle and the customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: are the two after the recent events afraid of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine customer clearly," "" "what some naïve might call" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also the subject of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassinations kill them completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "says Regine Customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the main and honorary officials have to look out for activities in the region and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">In the background, they always have the background that a new impetus for refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, politics hors.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to put them on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "in Urbach, we haven't yet arrived where we want to go," "" "Annika Deuschle said." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine's customer also makes it clear that the predictions are already busy to integrate the existing people in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
