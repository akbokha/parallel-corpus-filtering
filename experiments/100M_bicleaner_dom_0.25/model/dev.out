Obama receiving Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing action in the Middle East .
the meeting should also involve the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement of settlements and th@@ rows Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
by the deal promoted by Obama for Iran &apos;s nuclear programme , the relationship between the two has deterior@@ ated further .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans before the U.S. Congress , which was partly scored as aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had declined this with reference to the forthcoming election in Israel .
in an emergency call , Professor tries to have his girlfriend shot
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officers would have to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; lamb was important to emphas@@ ise that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably excited and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the house the officials found the cor@@ p@@ ses of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was scri@@ b@@ ble on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted to und@@ o it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school premises where , according to the police , he shot and killed a popular historical professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University police chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said Lamb had made the disa@@ strous distress call thereafter .
until the end of the day there was another death : the Lamb took life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
a day after the sho@@ ot@@ ings in the university , the students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb had motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to their lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or criminal background .
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty consisted of 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time there were some tendencies to problematic behavior .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who pra@@ ises Lamb , said he also seemed a bit nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for a leave of absence for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the employment policy of the University meant that the promotion that Lamb had worked so hard for him would not be a guarantee of an automatic way to employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs &apos;s lane when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb hardened himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &apos; home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
lamb began its work in 2009 at the University , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and pedago@@ gy .
he completed his doctorate in the spring in pedago@@ gy .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met by common friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar game .
at that time , he was the flock of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all girls melted away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house that ad@@ joins a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail performed both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter wrote and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poorly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had stopped Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September for the last time Lamb completed his guitar and harmon@@ ica game before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were in the clean up and jo@@ king with each other .
I mean they both had a good sense of cul@@ let .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his bro@@ therhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people took part in the Cle@@ vel@@ and Delta State Campus , including lec@@ turers , staff , students and members of the church at a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght memorial service .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts Mrs. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the M@@ ahn@@ awake while the University choir sang &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to reflect that the police are now saying that Lamb had made the call after he shot Schmidt and that he described Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in his emergency call , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
To@@ ys R Us is planning to hire less workers for the Christmas season
To@@ ys R Us says that there will not be so many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said that it is planning to hire 40,000 people in shops and distribution centers throughout the country . in 2014 , 4@@ 5.000 workers were hired at Christmas time .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with application talks this month and the number of employees from October to December is rising .
while the holidays are even months away , the Christmas business approaches , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to furnis@@ h shops with employees who sell , send and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox compla@@ ins about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great time for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it will gradually become clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins and it comes to mind that I am a simulated y@@ aw@@ ning and a length of arms from being with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest time travel film ever was filmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN chief ur@@ ges all parties , including the shared UN Security Council to unite and to support inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution .
B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - US , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the ver@@ ge of the meeting of ministers of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he depl@@ ored that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ an urged the five permanent members to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated in the at@@ tainment of a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 Survey values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks in poll@@ s , it has ( yet ) not worked .
ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the real estate Mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at that time , in 2011 , Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s lead was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of which won only one state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ sider groups like J@@ eb Bus@@ hs &apos;s Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now realize b@@ umps of stamina and begin to let their dollars flow to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
tr@@ umps Any popularity values have rot@@ ated by 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two out of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now , six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa confirmed last week that 60 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P voters would be happy with pumping as candidates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enthusiastic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; happy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two out of 10 say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about pumping ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Repub@@ lic@@ ans sees Tr@@ ump &apos;s temper@@ ament not as a problem .
whereas Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive remarks , 52 percent of the Irish voters ten@@ ding to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans believe that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is seen in the nation &apos;s first pres@@ election state , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to execute effectively his office , and almost six out of 10 independent states say that his temper@@ ament is not in the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
if they raise their scholars , Republi@@ can voters keep Tr@@ ump for real .
if they are asked who will most likely win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , say four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since when four of ten end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at that time in the last cycle , four out of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination over only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , there is evidence that a variety of GO@@ P voters tr@@ ump campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is still beating almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to the lead , while anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump harv@@ ests the majority of support .
he has 13 points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , prior to Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate that strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a tight majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have made up their mind .
a recent survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Tr@@ ump are saying they have firmly committed their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ ump is the strongest competi@@ tor at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say that they have made their opinion are twice as common for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say they agree with the issue of immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his electoral campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rap@@ ist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two months ago , Donald Tr@@ ump in his electoral campaign called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rap@@ ist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public discourse in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump @-@ decisive His@@ pan@@ o Americans will be kept away from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the re @-@ orientation efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post survey of Monday , six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump in issues of immigration .
so long as immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , Donald Tr@@ ump is apparently also doing .
the fru@@ stration over the government climbs to new levels .
meanwhile , around half of the support of Republi@@ can voters is dispens@@ ed with Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , above all by their out@@ sider status .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey by ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are also mad at Washington .
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines registers / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three out of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; hell@@ ish anno@@ yed . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential districts in Germany
here you find the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea .
in the street , a square meter of a roof@@ ed roof building costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which special situations one square metre the most cost .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student book in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential locations , however , there is a price like pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euros per square meter , well @-@ noted .
but well , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is here exceptionally not at the top .
champi@@ ons League : Bayern &apos;s dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double Tor@@ po@@ ke in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller just has a run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way to a deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze created a dream start to FC Bayern in the &quot; Mission Milan . &quot;
the team of trainers P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers double pack ( 5@@ 2. / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Götz@@ fri@@ ght ( 8@@ 9th ) deserves at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth starting success in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola will finally pick up the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
Müller was rewarded with his 28 hit in the Champions League in the Champions League for the Bavarian leadership of Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ go@@ Roberto , who had let a shot of the World Champion happen as a flan@@ k .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bavarian captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m before the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ Munich kept saying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated performance without gl@@ aring .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his most recent six home games in the Royal Class , among them famous clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund was also a stum@@ bling block ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bav@@ arians , defeated in seven European Cup du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they cour@@ age@@ ously ran to work in their offensive efforts , but often too in@@ ventive .
the attacks were introduced too often by a game shift on the left side Douglas Costa , which rarely went through against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right , when his flan@@ k broke out of the right half field in the left upper part of the cake .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , as Olympic Park Stur@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown hit the Pol@@ es head@@ ball ( 26 ) .
then by direct @-@ table , the go@@ al@@ keeper perf@@ ected Roberto with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians moved into their usual dominant game , pir@@ ate could set needle @-@ stit@@ ches .
but on the door@@ way Manuel Neu@@ er was deser@@ ted .
for example , when he drew a shot from ide@@ ye over the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola defended a four chain with David Al@@ aba in the Centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the Ka@@ der , was sitting outside at first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero gave the green light only after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who wants to make something else is already vi@@ cious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to the ailing Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meters Müller was still on top .
in front of the game it came to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly m@@ um@@ med Bayern @-@ fans in their spect@@ ator block obviously had provoked the supporters of host Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and proc@@ eeded with sticks against the Munich supporters .
at least one Bayern Fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs but also the teeth - this suggests a long @-@ term study of Potsdam .
good news : when doing so , the risk decreases rapidly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this is due to the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers had the risk of losing their teeth early in order to increase the 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold .
the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
the main causes of tooth decay are decay and inflammation of the gum , high@@ lighting the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors .
the link between smoking and loss of teeth therefore goes back to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , the researchers write in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take more than ten years before the threat to the level of non @-@ smokers remains , explained author Thomas Dietrich from Birmingham University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smokers , study head H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life@@ times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , leads to good dental health up to old age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of tooth@@ lessness was affected , the DI@@ f@@ E announced .
previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ lines the findings .
archae@@ ologists meet the remains of the late Anti@@ quity in Cologne &apos;s Rhein@@ u@@ fer
archaeological findings have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
in the vicinity of the building site for the new Rhine Boulevard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , &quot; said director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians have been searching for so @-@ called ground monuments .
for all building projects in the municipal district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as the Department of Arch@@ eological Pres@@ er@@ vation .
in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists found five .
Trier was already known from text documents that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century have stood a church , Trier explained .
in addition to the rest of the fortress and the church tower , a cemetery with around 350 graves has been discovered , which probably belonged to the church .

EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute on TT@@ IP
to increase the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ( TT@@ IP ) , the European Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its function corresponds to significantly more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D commission@@ er Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de pre@@ tends to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
TT@@ IP aims to create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings envis@@ age that the EU states and the United States will jointly select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should come from the EU , the US and from third countries to equal parts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow us to appeal against jud@@ gements .
up to now , the parties involved agreed among themselves on arbit@@ ers , a possibility of obj@@ ection against their judgments did not exist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past few months , it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Malm@@ ström commented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , she wants to work on an international investment court according to her own specifications .
there , for instance , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) , especially demanded by large corporations , are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great opposition in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a sort of parallel judi@@ ci@@ ary , through which companies can claim damages by tax@@ pa@@ yers , le@@ ash national laws or enforce a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organizations like Camp@@ act described the European Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was especially critic@@ ised that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German econom@@ ist Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great advance .
during the reform , the Commission took into account essential points that Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked out in the spring with other EU ministers .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration is from the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against limiting the potential of the economy by too many new rules .
in particular , small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
the negotiations on the TT@@ IP Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ( TT@@ IP ) have remained unclear on Wednesday .
negotiations have been ongoing since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally a framework for the agreement should already be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is considered to be un@@ sustainable .
delicate Folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the timi@@ d acting Fol@@ ks@@ änger was recording the picturesque US state Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost caught by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he talks about different places that he records on the map again and again , about his min@@ u@@ ti@@ ously and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they arose and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has proved to be a wonderful creative glacier .
with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs seem to harmon@@ i@@ ously sn@@ ug@@ gle up close to American folk in the late six@@ ties , but can drift into the great opul@@ ent at any time .
it is rum@@ oured that &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 states of the United States should be swept away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and in the vicinity of the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and has a positive outlook . &quot; &quot; &quot;

although nearly 2000 guests are sitting in their chairs , the distinc@@ tly ri@@ p@@ pled St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and folk .
without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians plays through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
you hear from the audience : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and you can therefore throw away the &quot; record in essence . &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ ges@@ tions
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut has been eag@@ erly awa@@ ited by the Prime Minister &apos;s question@@ er since his election .
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s fra@@ il and will be playing with David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to present the first of his six given questions shortly after lunch , and his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs from nearby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fewer theatres and more facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary review of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s lead , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C annual conference on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to pause on Tuesday during the singing of the national an@@ them during a commem@@ oration ceremony for the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence has provoked criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the heart of several title pages stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has drawn attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two news night program , he suggested to the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are referring to differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than one sixth of the parliamentary party supported him originally as a leader .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also st@@ acking within the Labour Party , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C Conference that Labour Law@@ made changes in order to remove the whole idea of limiting overall .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and pensions minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limitation of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he is T@@ ory boss , over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch Box in the Parliament .
the Labour leader , who has promised a different policy , says he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has given him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s questioning is too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he will be subjected to both &quot; skill &quot; and the dispute with ad@@ versaries and has instead decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the Shadow Econom@@ ist , is represented when he does not take part - for example if Mr Cameron is on the move abroad .
he also had the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the House , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy show , &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s question@@ er . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the questioning was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the verdict of a leader and his leadership in the House of Com@@ mons and his position among his MPs , although critics have argued that it had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needed far @-@ reaching reforms .

pounds increased by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound asc@@ ended br@@ ittle to data indicating an increase in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , FT@@ SE 100 was increased by SA@@ B@@ Miller &apos;s bid .
between May and July , the result without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared with the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and provided estim@@ ation since 2009 at the time of an increase in interest rates .
the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro on 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index increased by 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking the offer of rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ ly@@ sch .
according to encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont , Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ &apos;s latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported back growth .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core increased by 5 % after the mining giant said that it took 2.5 billion $ through a stock sales as part of its debt reduction strategy .
the Shar@@ eholders of the Packaging and Paper Group Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decline of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his assessment of the rating to &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports went up by 3.1 % after the sports clothing company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages thre@@ aten expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ or@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labour costs in his company , he says .
the cost could hit the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

not bad .
hundreds of fans attended J@@ ustin yesterday .

this has already taken care of .

if J@@ ustin Bi@@ eber is drinking a coffee , one is astonished at the window .
he is said to have captured more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e is too far .
others stress that Bi@@ eber is ranked # 1 with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; in the United States and the UK .
Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , doesn &apos;t interest the many zer@@ os first .
at least he does so .
PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A poster brings Lebanese to potato d@@ ön@@ er idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
it is both - in the potato d@@ ön@@ er , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ i owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the slogan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potato instead of d@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had seen by chance on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , there has been a barbecue sk@@ ewer in its shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the idea of the Lebanese has now been registered by the Patent Office in Munich .
it has recently been protected as utility model according to the authority .
for this reason , Al@@ hay does not want to reveal how much meat and how many potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just as much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding also goes well with its customers .
Met@@ cash La@@ un@@ ches Dis@@ ability Camp@@ a@@ ign to Com@@ bat Al@@ di@@ - En@@ tran@@ ce
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the I@@ GA branch from an Al@@ di invasion in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a sustainability campaign to defend the market share of I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di is preparing the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA Super@@ markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA shops and shop@@ keepers who sell endor@@ sed tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish more details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual Investor strategy day .
there is a lot on the game since South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s I@@ GA shop business and generate higher profit margins as a Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will s@@ nat@@ ch around five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after opening its first markets and take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and in the amounts on Met@@ a &apos;s high fixed cost base could cost Met@@ cash approximately 13 million dollars before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA purch@@ as@@ ers are the most faithful .
Morgan Stan@@ ley believes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in food and food business by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ cash would probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
i@@ G@@ AS &apos;s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food Commerce , which has been supplied by 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 per cent since 2012 , reflecting the reduction in operating debt with equal pressure on turnover and margins .
the wholes@@ aler , however , resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to equal sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and to improve their stores by faster growing fresh food and to deliver a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s chief executive secretary Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and shop remedi@@ ation programmes are to be put to El@@ an and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in the year 2017 .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by President of Australian Tennis Federation Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism of his behaviour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ nes and deserves praise rather than criticism for his own behaviour in the opinion of the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came into the spotlight with the not@@ orious examination of Kyr@@ gy@@ z and St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati shortly thereafter Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison shou@@ ting out : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka had to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ h , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp sh@@ ook up a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ gow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing that I &apos;m quite en@@ vious about is the fact that after my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was a little bit involved in the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he broke a ra@@ cket when he lost due to a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player to break a ra@@ cket of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know he is not proud of it .
but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the fairly prov@@ ok@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a bit too severely .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well trained , he &apos;s good in shape , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision not to consider Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan during the important preliminary decision , which begins on Friday and describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term permanent component to return to the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all of the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe that Nick has done very quickly what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he has made some bad mistakes and he deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the ramp , in which he can only think about it , I think it is appropriate , and it is best for the team and it is best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary states emergency , closes the border , stops refugees
Hungary decl@@ ines the emergency and locked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to come illeg@@ ally into the country .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants drow@@ ned in a land of no man and Ser@@ b officials re@@ acted with indignation .
the people fle@@ eing from violence have stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land at the street between the two control points of the countries and built up tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations increased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and shou@@ ted insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some returned from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back while more and more arrived from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Ser@@ b border ended one day after the 28 @-@ Nations bloc at a controversial meeting in Brussels which could not reconci@@ le a common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the overwhel@@ med Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that , eventually , the next month or by the end of the year , an agreement would be made that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a spe@@ edy action from Brussels or its neighbors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency situation announced on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block streets and speed up asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after finishing a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were deployed in the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and an entry point in the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees claiming to be protected - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damaging of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 ft ) high fence that the government built along the southern border to Serbia led to a crime . these laws also lay higher sentences for condemned human traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the emergency &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ ac Repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the use of the military , expected next week , but repor@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities knew 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated the country .
they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are busy re@@ pairing the fence quickly .
on Tuesday morning , Hungarian civil servants also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and squee@@ ze a crowd to push themselves there .
about 20 managed to enter , but thousands stayed outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they allowed to enter Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l hal@@ ved
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit advance in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her against the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in primary elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ ander is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced , whether he is running for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic elec@@ torate of the prim@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic voters tell us that it is too early to say that their opinion determines what candidates they will support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their election than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders earned some gains .
Clinton has a major lead in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have declined .
their support among men has declined mark@@ edly , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points back .
Clin@@ tons advantage in democratic voters under the age of 50 has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
but Clinton still has a big advantage over the older voters .
last month Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit lead on the liber@@ als , but S@@ ander now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the pre @-@ election nationwide say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm when nominated by the party .
one quarter would support them with some reservations and further 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are above all enthusiastic about her .
the views are stronger than those currently un@@ supported by Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusi@@ astically support them .
while 48 percent of the primary elections say they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters are saying this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 per cent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time that a woman &apos;s president is ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention her connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consent to the handling of the problems and the elec@@ torate shall also be cited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the vice president puts a potential for the presidential office into the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third thinks he should not do it .
if democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
more than half of Clinton &apos;s supporters say that Bi@@ den would be far ahead of her second choice .
if Bi@@ den decides not to run for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead is increased from S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ des in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters consider Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election , but this figure has fallen from 78 per cent in the last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; selectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important in a candidate , Demo@@ crat voters call questions about the elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar to last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters stands out to be unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some key features of voters in the prim@@ aries of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
multi@@ ples consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
for the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best cut off with hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of democratic voters don &apos;t believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of him .
democratic elec@@ torate of the prim@@ aries generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic elec@@ torate has no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server during office as foreign affairs ministers continue to be questioned , most demo@@ crat voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it did not affect their opinions overall .
but it is another story in the American public overall .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion on this was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the email controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s overall opinion even though 36 percent said that her opinion had wor@@ sen@@ ed .
they are mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse .
although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of her party , this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters overall : only 32 percent see it as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 % of those entitled to vote do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of those entitled to vote nation@@ ally also see Tr@@ ump as not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
however , Clinton and Tr@@ ump will receive good lead notes .
of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush get best with hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders as hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the prim@@ aries is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves closer to Donald Tr@@ ump on a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is close behind Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times Survey
in the meantime half of the voters &apos; support in the new pol@@ l is dispens@@ ed with , and others lose dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers nationwide . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , 27 % in the Tuesday survey .
but Car@@ son shot down from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passes Tr@@ ump under Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio - Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated with Wis@@ con@@ sins govern@@ ors Scott Walker , who is the deepest , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
the former Gover@@ nor of Florida J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place at 6 % .
the error margin at the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey released last week shows that Car@@ son is rising in poll@@ s - with 19 % support among the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the recent ABC News / Washington Post pol@@ l showed also Tr@@ ump significantly ahead of Car@@ son .
with a look at a Car@@ son rising in the past week , Tr@@ ump has found some side hi@@ res for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question tr@@ umps .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign performance in I@@ owa .
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even though peak values are only measured in distance , bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers already have a trip to the Mediterranean to find even more warm water .
a bath in the north or Baltic sea should be a rather short pleasure with a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people don &apos;t go to the sea anymore : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North Sea and Baltic Sea this week , shares the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) .
bathing temperatures , on the other hand , still offer the Mediterranean : in the east there is even up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic Sea there are 25 degrees in the top , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood are bur@@ dened with the death of a Bar@@ uch college new@@ bie
almost two years after a student died during a religious ritual of a student compound in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges against five people were submitted .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , shared the police .
officials said he had been loaded with bound eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to turn over a frozen field to a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g compla@@ ined about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g became impot@@ ent and were supposed to wait an hour before they brought him to hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , goo@@ gling his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice , police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide utensils and basically set the fr@@ at@@ ernity of the Brotherhood over that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ pa@@ ef Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his wounds .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g was repeatedly added to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs with dul@@ ler force .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the can@@ es of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for the first five members on charges of murder .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic attacks and the formation of a criminal organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the people involved , but if there is an organization which - officially or un@@ officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also be held ac@@ coun@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch &apos;s College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood has re@@ vo@@ ke its affili@@ ation with the local group .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a rise in interest will come , and the house will be sha@@ ken , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance for the process .
a recession came within just 11 months following the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react .
therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank have so strongly emphasized that investors should not concentrate on when it begins to increase interest rates but rather to the period required for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could find that all the excitement was exagger@@ ated due to an increase in interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to clients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock which many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no effect .
here is a view based on historical trends , as some areas of the economy might react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency to stran@@ gle property income from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which might reflect the lag behind monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happened after interest rate increases in the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market has been upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days after ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis , which published Bob D@@ oll , Head of Plant Strate@@ gic at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the margin of return begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote it .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that could not exist before and which could accelerate a recession .
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , with the 118 interest rates since 1950 only nominal GDP was below 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in a fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raise the question &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether it &apos;s different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants spent the whole year on an interest rate in the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC might appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading is only a 25 percent chance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all raising cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ist places very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far .
fixed income was also volati@@ le as the market anticipated an increase in interest , and the pattern is rather similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than in equi@@ ties when they change their strategic course .
in the case of bonds the yields seem to change as soon as the first increase / decrease occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the increase cycle , the bond yields are immediately falling , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the increase in interest rates will result in yields between longer and shorter bonds closer together and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ interest loans often yield better yields in such a climate , although &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is interesting is that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have increased , the yield curve is flat , lending margins have expanded and volati@@ lity continues - all the features of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy .
in large and large companies that handle the greater part of their business operations in the United States will benefit from this when interest rates increase and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts are getting worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market , as well as financing their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to respond very positively to three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analy@@ st in a report for customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded 5 percentage points on average after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their equi@@ val@@ ents with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts become a major problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose most , said Gold@@ man .
outside the pure share games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; savers could see profits by higher yields , even if experts of different opinion are how fast that will take place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says MP Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the channel for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ encing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ish@@ able from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins picked up the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Voice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said that this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Classic FM , claiming a leading member of Parliament and increasing pressure on the channel to prove that he is doing something that the private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham also told the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public broad@@ caster &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no more to distinguish from his commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like using the word &quot; stupid &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which began last December .
the BBC Music Awards , launched last year , seem to be The Br@@ its only under a different name .
so , if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously named examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ing@@ ham said .
BBC General Director re@@ jects the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and education to the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , that I won &apos;t learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works is really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder was needed to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sport to tread the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
the T@@ ory member Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins picked up The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a special BBC way &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it starts the next time a series of entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from further series of The Voice in the future or to issue money from the commission for other entertainment formats .
net sales were slow@@ ing down in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of the records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday in November has slow@@ ed spending
virtual shopping has been bo@@ oming for over a decade , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
but experts say that there are now signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure on August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back until 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of The Guardian &apos;s IM@@ R@@ G sales index .
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this is comm@@ uting , and we will possibly experience that growth is dimin@@ ishing .
the Black Friday phenomenon that was imported from America is cited as a reason for declining sales .
experts believe that buyers will return their purchases from this event , which will take place on the last Friday of November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which the purch@@ as@@ ers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent purch@@ as@@ ers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found that £ 5 was spent more than £ 1 online from £ 5 .
in some products such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now done via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca during crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 victims are borne by Muslims in the first bur@@ ial in Mec@@ ca by the streets .
Saudi Arabia makes the collapse partially of the huge Saudi Bin Laden group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed as a crane collap@@ sed at Mek@@ ka &apos;s grand mos@@ que .
mour@@ ners packed , extensively dressed in white , the way to declare their respect when the first of the dead started their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance ch@@ urch@@ yard .
the procession passed by the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane rus@@ hed through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then upon the bed@@ sides .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king handed over a san@@ ction over the Bin Laden family &apos;s construction company because of the disaster that also left 3@@ 94 wounded .
the bodies of 29 inhabitants who were killed when a crane rus@@ hed through the Great Central Committee of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets .
among the dead were Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane rus@@ hed down .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ ling in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officers have already stated that the H@@ add@@ ling will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to go to the city .
today King Sal@@ man said the Bin Laden group should not have stopped the arm of the crane when it was not used .
an Arab version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said the bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ speaking service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad was prohibited .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man v@@ owed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which rus@@ hed into a courtyard of the Great mo@@ ose , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ ling , which was held later this month .
the Bin Laden Group has issued no statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also ad@@ mon@@ ished the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s large mo@@ ose as part of the massive construction project headed by the Bin Laden group .
Bin Laden &apos;s Bin Laden family has been associated with the Saudi royal family for decades and is taking over major construction projects .
the late leader of al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &apos;s .
the wre@@ ath of the crane arrived in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said that 15@@ 8 people were hospit@@ alized .
government officials stated that 1 million rif@@ les ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently wounded .
other publishers receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap East European tra@@ des@@ men is over
British employ more and more arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ people from Eastern Europe has risen
this means that 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops which are target@@ ing professional tra@@ des@@ people will be opened
at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher will close 60 B &amp; Q sales points nationwide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City chief correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is said that Br@@ its will lay down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out the work in their home
if you are skill@@ fully cop@@ ing with a hammer or a brush for painting walls , these days you seem to belong to a minority .
because Brit@@ ons increasingly employ professionals to perform DIY jobs in their homes , so the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the DIY store chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices is now obsol@@ ete .
for this reason , King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ g@@ fix shops that address craftsmen and close up to 60 stores of B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the shop are met by women .
at the moment the men predomin@@ ated .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households who perform more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Ms Lau@@ ry : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are still a majority of men in our stores . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this more towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , half of our clients are women with 80 percent of the decisions about buying articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , one of the top five women listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 per cent of the team with women , including its management and CFO .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Ms Lau@@ ry : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the Group deb@@ ated the cost of closing the shops .
due to the trends King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open up 200 new stores .
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob for un@@ faith@@ fulness to court
on Wednesday , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball tournament A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to answer for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and ev@@ asion on Wednesday .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of official abuse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from this accus@@ ation , he was legally acqu@@ itted in May . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current trial was postpon@@ ed .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary investigation , the accused had cryst@@ alli@@ zed out that in 2006 to 2011 the defend@@ ants had funds from the association accounts , which they were allowed to dispose of in their functions , for private purposes .
he estimates the damage with around 400@@ ,000 euros .
sports officials are also accused of financial failures .
this fact leaves the chair of the Sho@@ v@@ eller Senate , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
in the event of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that at no point was the association an asset of wealth .
the sports officials had charged only expense compensation and the sports club , for whom they had worked from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money from debt - the Passi@@ va amounted to about 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illing in 2001 ( about 4@@ 4,000 euros ) .
&quot; at that time we were standing in front of the situation : do we continue or lock the club ? , &quot; said one of the defend@@ ants , in the bread@@ board big business audi@@ tor of the financial department .
he then decided to take over this task with his colleague and co @-@ defend@@ ant .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , laid down our life insurance as security in the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been agreed with the association : you can manage the money freely , no debt can be made .
furthermore , in case of a financial success , the reimbur@@ sement of expenses compensation had been decided retro@@ actively by 1991 .
therefore one has paid off part of the reimbur@@ sement of expenses only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus had been on the account .
therefore , l@@ ump and not detailed descriptions appeared , the former ob@@ servant explained the processes .
the accounts and the savings books jointly administered the two defend@@ ants , and the second defend@@ ant said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the pay@@ outs have not been disclosed in detail to the association , the judge asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association didn &apos;t care in detail for the financial sector , it was important to have been free of debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when investigations started in 2011 against the official investigation for official abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
the defend@@ ants declared that this was the case .
this securities account ran on the name of the second defend@@ ant and was not known to the association according to its testimony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent knows no answer for a long time .
then he finally said he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the public prosec@@ utor in the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant was informed that the function@@ ary justified itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer has been formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claim res@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why compensation ? , wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor .
the first defend@@ ant stated that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association had never been damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do when the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With him all of you are from the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the function@@ ary said he never paid a cent salary , he only calcul@@ ates mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
on di@@ ets he charged the club 1.000 Euro per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
exact documentation for the early years could not show the accused .
these were no longer retained after an audit in which everything had been judged correctly , they declared .
mil@@ eage allowance was also related to the second defend@@ ant .
all the postpon@@ ements were made in cash , for that he had to go to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence to the Bank , he explained in his statement .
the main hearing will continue on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard opens another 30,000 jobs
in addition to the workforce reduction , which has been ongoing for three years , the computer giant will continue to grow further jobs when spl@@ itting the company .
the U.S. machine Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) has no end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment .
in order to save costs of EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) , the company announced on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the step will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the five @-@ year @-@ long mining of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed .
at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 associates .
the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Packard shares declined by 2.3 percent .
the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto group , which has become a company with printers , is currently spl@@ itting up : in this way , the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led in a new society , separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker customer demand for its services made Lenovo the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC producer .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , the sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to almost 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
as a result , revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responds with a split and massive sub@@ missions on the changes in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company led by Me@@ g Whit@@ man re@@ acted late to the fact that customers increasingly buy smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and do more and more transactions online .
in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age the reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would mostly be rep@@ u@@ di@@ ated : 54 per cent opposed it , 35 percent expressed appro@@ b@@ ably .
that other states fly air@@ strikes against IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 per cent is positive .
24 per cent , on the other hand , is to intervene in the conflict .
a co @-@ operation with the Syrian government , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , rejected 51 percent of respon@@ dents , 20 percent would be there .
29 percent could not decide .
car : second press day at the 6@@ 6th IAA
at the centre of the fair , up to 27 September networked , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and electro@@ mobility are at the centre of the fair .
according to two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; Mobility Connect &quot; on Thursday .
the wide public can attend the IAA from Saturday .
as two years ago , the organis@@ er of the V@@ DA Verband - Verband V@@ DA - expects about 900 000 visitors .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violent erup@@ tion at Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police were deployed at the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Wasser@@ row@@ er against several hundred deployed refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported on the phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it was a police line formed and behind the polic@@ eman stood a water @-@ laun@@ cher .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially continued to inhal@@ e pepper spray .
after that , the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now withdrawn something cau@@ ti@@ ously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
children who inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees gathered in themselves and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the press spokes@@ men of the Serbian police suffered injuries by using tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
the world ob@@ serves when the US bank@@ note comes together on two days , Wednesday and Thursday to make the important decision whether to raise interest for the first time for almost a decade or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists surv@@ eyed by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed would do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates at the current level will last from 0 to 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest set on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ isation of interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , senior staff at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is on a relatively good level of power , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ru@@ sty outlook on global relationships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs point out that the odds against such a move are good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision is to be announced at 8 : 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death R@@ ump at Delta State University left behind ap@@ ologies
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleagues on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; said authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor of ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He has shot on someone and killed anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb said to the staff of the emergency center that the police must send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cute dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but will probably be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give him .
lamb did not give any explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 which said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could und@@ o it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when police surrounded him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday that Lamb had supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there was &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that they were married for about seven years , as a &quot; good person . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but they remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog called Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police said that she called her relative at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; he is not going to jail . &quot;
when polic@@ emen picked him up on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
lamb received a Ph@@ .@@ D. from Delta State University in the spring of 2015 , as his CV specifies on the University &apos;s website .
stars who have lost their luck charm

in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer .
the actor also claimed to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was con@@ vic@@ ted of drug possession .

Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa builds the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
150 of the around 1000 executives around the world will cost the workplace .
however , there are new negotiations with the pilot trade union .
Lufthansa builds up its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the low @-@ budget Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the real@@ ignment is based on a contribution to earnings of around € 500 million a year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline divided on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa does not have a board for the passenger business in the future .
the low @-@ cost airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
in future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the executive team headed by chief Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r emphas@@ ises the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
up to now , the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex .
the airlines operate under the roof of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the conflict of tari@@ ffs with the cockpit settlement cockpit ( VC ) the negotiations are to be resum@@ ed on this Thursday after the strike stopped .
this was shared by the union .
the theme of the talks should be the retirement plan for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year of a predicted record result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cockpit intends &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to come as fast as possible to yield results . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and the airline led to a number of strikes over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the drivers , the background is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ par@@ ag@@ us concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it seems that the Lufthansa routes are being out@@ sour@@ ced to the Group &apos;s own budget line Eu@@ row@@ ings in the fight against competitors .

hat@@ ch Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ tures
in the Champions League defeat of Manchester , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
while this brought the left outside defender to the weeping and will exclude him from playing for at least six months , Louis van Ga@@ al will not give up hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w had broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Van Ga@@ al : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double bone frac@@ ture and is located in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s horrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 likes it very hard and then plays fantastic , and then it happens .
he had an oxygen mask in the dressing room .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it lasts for six months , and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the suspension of an i@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not punish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian arbit@@ er had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a tweet on Sha@@ w &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I &apos;m coming back more again . &quot;
related : Manchester United suffering the loss of hat@@ ch Sha@@ w in defeat at PS@@ V
the UK distributor has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover until the coming of June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V coach , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player with this type of injury leaves the place , all are very sad about it .
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al &apos;s Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s very difficult , because it wasn &apos;t his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ c@@ u said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched it &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very ill . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - following a cou@@ l@@ isse by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows the Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t be long before you know it by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister opted for The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read to my children because it always seems to give an image or message we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron re@@ port@@ edly describes the plot of the book , instead re@@ produces an abstra@@ cts of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; in the middle of the walled city of Th@@ itz @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel , who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if this is not yet suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly read like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ itz @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems impro@@ b@@ able that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . here , an un@@ named boy hears how the local environment is devast@@ ated by the gre@@ edy , trees fal@@ si@@ fying , Th@@ ought stri@@ ck@@ ling Once @-@ ler , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; is devast@@ ated .
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row after a child .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s electoral college .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s team , but it is still hard
hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ re that England selected for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not close an outward victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks Side is possibly less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali is developing as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown quantity at test level , is an option for the attack .
this message @-@ related news : Adam Ly@@ th retired from the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyze .
during his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are based on results .
there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , since - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
a long time ago , one would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate .
if he hopefully turns out other Yor@@ k@@ shire runs , there &apos;s another chance .
the England trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss praised his attitude , even though he did not get such good performances , and that surprises me not ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to set his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and forward .
the only accus@@ ation that could be raised was that England first made Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales is coming in , and he is a drummer , whom I set up high .
he is an X factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 on a Tr@@ ent Bridge seat , which made us very much .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends , of course , on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of setting Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ bowl and got four squ@@ e@@ aks , turned up and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s cri@@ cket of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ ques may have not done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he joined Open@@ er in 2001 .
he immediately made three hundred re@@ eds and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes to the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him , he was very impressed me as a young man .
people may see his stat@@ s - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a punch , but there is no great number of backup sp@@ inners that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team England has done some clever additions to the train@@ ee .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ ding , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as consultant for the test matches could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game that will bring a wealth of experience , as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood is coming for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful deployment into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the changing cub@@ icle , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .
Coll@@ ys te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team players will not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made with a light heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit from the UK out of the EU ) could gain allow@@ ances if the economy is in a sl@@ um@@ ber until 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ expressed ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper every day , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n becomes the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who viol@@ ently stri@@ des for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at enthusi@@ astically said that some member states , so deeply involved in various crises , as the EU is now and not always on its own guilt , Britain &apos;s self @-@ created agenda with split concessions and disturbing Treaty changes that they usually do not want are full .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and finance ministers climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend , who wishes a great Britain inside the EU Zel@@ tes - &quot; Let us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and let &apos;s see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point in some capitals in which it doesn &apos;t matter if we are staying or going .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as it has happened in the exc@@ essively long exp@@ ir@@ ers such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande is looking back on his re @-@ election or re @-@ election in 2017 .
it is also a da@@ zz@@ ling force .
Poland might soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left .
it is hard to imagine that they will take a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they do not want because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may even intentionally not plan helpful notes , quite in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press @-@ zone , as they were not during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opport@@ uni@@ sts , who made a name as an &quot; EU straight ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s .
with all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who was his enemies .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ gers , tel@@ eph@@ ones and pseu@@ do non @-@ nationals who own most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her but found that if you &apos;re sitting in a cage with a hot Gor@@ illa , you &apos;d better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum vor@@ tex because Bla@@ ir had the principle of the un@@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor .
the press has never forgiven it either .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly can@@ ter on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me anymore - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks Boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch strategy of the 80 &apos;s , a mistake at that time and today .
it may take , but he has to develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC @-@ settee he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position in Europe is - I express it friendly - in development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ bst@@ one tendency and the wild gra@@ ds of Tor@@ ey &apos;s Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ismus can say yes to everyone .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; One Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in the radio and on TV this week said when the sc@@ outs fought in him , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight for &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and dep@@ u@@ ties after all reports at their conference on Monday evening .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding site of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks so .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in line with its Benn@@ ite Siege - Economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find in all a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - in order to make concessions to the British , if all this can be sen@@ sel@@ ess ?
the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction by the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded of something on Monday , what was called the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critici@@ ze Public Health England &apos;s report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts , who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , joined the Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; article report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra@@ ordinarily win@@ dy basis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at which he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said the public expects that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 individuals who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multi @-@ criteria decision analysis ( MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damages of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ based products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was previously reported by British American Tob@@ acco Instrument ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting agreed to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to have received according to reports previously reported by the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not delivered , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also include a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the meeting also took part in the tobacco management of P@@ he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acknow@@ le@@ dges &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence of most products &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these connections or limitations will be discussed in the P@@ he Report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been premature as a way of smoking for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims had already been re@@ acted earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies in his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low in comparison , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the clear duty to inform the public about what is proof and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco .
nearly 80@@ ,000 people die annually on a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
by setting up current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ enders , says former boss of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ erin and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said the radio fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK stations .
he critici@@ zed the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs , likely to be seen by a smaller audience , into hard @-@ disputed time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and by sen@@ ders such as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success to contact the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC commissioned or send programs that would also be clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Upper House Communication Committee as part of his investigation on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the radio fee , what I don &apos;t think medium or long term for a good idea , you should at least put your production on programs that others do not make or commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve as broad a support as possible for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s obviously non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax could be funded without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ erin is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm for that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am we@@ ary to see how this is supposed to be public television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said the BBC was on the hunt for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts return what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ tag@@ gart speech in Edinburgh in 2003 that BBC shows like East@@ ern@@ ers should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal &quot; programs &quot; should go to BB@@ C4 , but they fulfill their tasks , and they can argue if they go to their hypo@@ critical missions to justify 4 billion £ radio fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
to the radio fee Johnson said to the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value from it .
of course , you all think we all think that you get a great value for £ 150 a year here , but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 pounds , ask me if this is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 leader David El@@ stein , who also testified before the Committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to verify its Rei@@ gn mission &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to inform , train and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example of this change in &quot; inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with commercial sen@@ ders alli@@ ances enter to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ Genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems which can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulses , which have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by switching on motor neur@@ on cells that are genetically altered to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms show the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ Genetics , which can be used ultrasound to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electric impulses to the brain of people for the treatment of symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
round@@ worms usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic air bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applying ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro @-@ ves@@ icles and transferred into the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the method has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ Genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which has to be sent down to the desired place in the brain on an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily disable the targeted human neur@@ ons for the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

but a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and underground trains that require a second look .
&quot; important notice : travel from 15 to 18 September with the DL@@ R ? &quot; ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) read in the font types of the London Under@@ ground and the trademarks of the DL@@ R Line , which turns into a picture of a tank .

the 300 posters are artists who exhibited their work in the museum for cruel designs in Bank@@ sys Dis@@ mal@@ and .
a collective with the name Special Pat@@ rol Group helped to distribute in London and used &quot; Ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks , &quot; a 6 £ Pack of Allen keys that claims that &quot; access to around one third of bus stops is gaining on the planet . &quot;

after Gav@@ in Grin@@ don , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ el@@ ol designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists become more critical and try to bring political works to the audience outside galleries .
many artists engage with activists within protest movements to work and realize that they have to go outside into the real world , so that their art has an influence on society .

the Am@@ nesty @-@ Video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works non @-@ profit with the graphic artist and vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over artist , who works for free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP Creative Director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around the advertising for the weapons exhibition - through a blank of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic z@@ wi@@ el@@ ich@@ y company advertisement , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the blu@@ eing with bright colors and animation it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Am@@ nesty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we need now is a progress of the British government and the guarantee that torture instruments are not illeg@@ ally tra@@ ded on our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative art around the weapons trade fair dates back to the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors f@@ use fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; uniquely shaped battle head that delivers outstanding retro@@ active effects inside the target . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whatever it does , it will not be pleasant .
eight golden rules for living in student resi@@ dences
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ for@@ getting 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved into a student residence , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ lasting complaints about others .
most of what I learned can be disti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
the entrance into student residence halls reaches from easily nerve wre@@ cking to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to chat : people tell where you come from , whether and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ age , where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &apos;re honest Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks reception , movie night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people dress and la@@ im their under@@ wear .
related to this : don &apos;t remember to start a relationship at university
intro@@ vert receives a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences are a space @-@ to @-@ space @-@ bu@@ stling culture that can be friendly and social and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get the energy that I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to feel when a milit@@ ant is exhausted by soci@@ ability - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
speaking of kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student resi@@ dences had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship fills by che@@ eks .
as you start the university at the high point of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people is less wei@@ rd than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome in the neighborhood , I baked you something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade goo@@ dies is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
badly mixed l@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat result in people sleeping when you drop .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ?
check this with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to use themselves even when they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with a more balanced way than my room@@ mate who added a deterg@@ ent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people who sit in the glass house in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb .
a girl on my floor asked her neighbours whether it makes them something to make drum &amp; bass a little qui@@ eter than three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more loud music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , they kindly allowed their neighbours to sleep two hours before dropping their own music , shut their door and went to their three @-@ hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would random@@ ly move into the same residence hall ?
conver@@ sely , it would not be deeply embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future spouse , take care of them , dis@@ connect and then see them every day and perhaps see how they are moving all together friends to yourself ?
of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , at least try to talk to your abdom@@ en a little reason .
in the exciting moment in which you realize that someone has left its keys in its not closed room , the boundary between an Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing is more fin@@ er than it seems .
a good stroke is funny , but it takes only moments to get to the bo@@ omer@@ ang .
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but never forget someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water which you place in the freezer - but do not loose their possessions on the ceiling any more than twice .
row houses for refugees , single @-@ educ@@ ators , low @-@ income students
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner builds row houses for people who do not have a lot of money in the Fran@@ con@@ ian corner ental corner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for example for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living space , but also the only mother and the low @-@ income servant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build cheap and well today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner thinks to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds row houses for refugees in a project .
Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gymn@@ as@@ tics has no sustainability .
for people remain a great part here .
in view of the refugee flow , we also need enough living space in the next few decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ dner : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a row house needs the least place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it facilitates integration .
this is different if you put people in blocks of living .
each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for four asylum seekers each .
each apartment has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace again , I go back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to the specific needs .
how high are the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 euros , without plot .
that is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .
that is reasonable .
do the building regulations complic@@ ate their plans ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ dner : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have correctly dra@@ gged my project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially complic@@ ating is the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ cl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the parking regulation .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
it is still under@@ lined who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in cities there is no place for this .
refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did local residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
which definitely is not right .
but don &apos;t you tigh@@ ten the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : it &apos;s true : over the last five years we had a building boom in Germany , but luxury apartments have been built , which can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the only mother or the low @-@ income servant .
I &apos;ll show you how to build cheap and well today .
that is what it is all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple Update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings App , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gener@@ ate General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install it .
some have encountered problems after installation , because they get an error message indicating that the &quot; software update is missing . &quot;
to b@@ ypass the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the dele@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able by the stream@@ lining of the update . similarly , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them as soon as the process is finished .
it is worth making sure your mobile phone is charged while updating or is near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone might switch off half way and this could lead to an interruption of the update .

district office looking for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the senior centre Anton@@ isti@@ ft have merged under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new starting point at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg Square .
in addition to consultations you can also take part in courses .
the social foundation draws it down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office recently opened there .
here , immediately next to the purchasing market , sen@@ iors and counsel@@ ors receive information on questions such as health insurance or health care insurance companies .
for years , we have been using our out@@ patient care service to ensure that often informal car@@ egi@@ vers are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many services of the insur@@ ers are not seldom used because the complexity of the insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new landlord Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Anton@@ isti@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ambul@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this purpose the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
it is therefore possible to use additional offers such as prevention of fall prevention , memory training or a physi@@ otherapy treatment .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis ideally complement each other .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior centre for care and care &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; described Heike R@@ ie@@ del , Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both business leaders are seeing the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city center particularly in the demographic shift .
because this makes a good de@@ central infrastructure in the individual parts of Bam@@ berg in the future indispensable .
moreover , as Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined at the inauguration ceremony , the district office also devoted itself to the unification of the old age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ alizing get @-@ together . &quot;
this makes the social foundation a great contribution to the fact that sen@@ iors can live as independent and as good as possible in their familiar environment .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m .

Viennese architect Karl M@@ ang died in 92 years
Karl M@@ ang , one of the do@@ yen of Viennese architecture , is dead .
he died on 5 September at the age of 92 , as the Künst@@ l@@ erhaus was wed@@ ded on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with M@@ ang , the Künst@@ l@@ erhaus was a honorary member and at the same time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as was said in the dispatch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
born in Vienna in 1922 , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna at Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War .
since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect , but also worked as a teacher , writer and institute director .
from 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design .
in the 1980s he was commissioned to set up the treas@@ ury in the Hof@@ burg in Vienna and the conversion of the Palace Lob@@ ko@@ witz to the Austrian Theatre Museum .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only after that will be decided whether meadow will be displayed , or not .

men vali@@ date 17 @-@ year old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are searching for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ or@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 11 : 45 p.m. , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one from the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an , according to the police , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called for them to wait for him .
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft petrol station .
there were also three people on the premises of the gas station .
one of these men now cried out to the young man and hit the face with his fist .
the victim suffered a nose @-@ break and ble@@ ed heavily out of the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first left off his sacrifice .
from his friends the injured young man was brought home .
the perpetr@@ ator persecuted the group with a passenger car to their home and passed there demonstr@@ atively several times .
when you didn &apos;t see the car any more , the injured went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
by using a head@@ stock , one applied to the face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim .
the injured person had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
so far only a vag@@ ue bag description is available .
one of the men was about 1.80 m tall .
the second ra@@ cket was supposed to have been about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was clothed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ris@@ ausen .
the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , Wirtschafts@@ förder@@ in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased about this .
in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are lucky : there Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice of rock stand@@ ings on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ris@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich succ@@ eeds his successor in the coming months with half a position .
after a reconstruction phase Müller will open the practice on October 12 , until then he will invest 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was symp@@ a@@ thetic to the first sight when the Fel@@ is@@ aus@@ ens met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who is currently completing her medical training at the Ver@@ den hospital and also wants to enter into practice this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the tr@@ ash would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far , I simply ph@@ oned her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea to practice their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; clos@@ eness and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to meet and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees his own boss soon .
and so they agreed , the garbage cans bought the house with practice .
however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time father , Frank Müller , also grew up there , his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several doctor &apos;s offices and in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed a senior physician in Di@@ ep@@ holz and is involved in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from September 19th , the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
while the surgeon works as a family practitioner , Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ is@@ ausen , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ acional ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Müll@@ ers , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as house doctors .
&quot; end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l .
after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
in addition , the computer is completely renewed .
a total of 50@@ 000 Euros will receive the mil@@ ler as part of a subsi@@ dy programme of the administrative district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ises vel@@ vet mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , approximately 2000 patients arrive in the practice of rock stand@@ ings every quarter , in the North German average practice it is about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another doctor &apos;s practice .
a positive side @-@ effect of the practical tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ris@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor had been found , she would have gone too .
those who visit Müll@@ ers &apos; Consul@@ tation hour , by the way , also look above all in familiar faces : take over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power of the ri@@ ms .
with their par@@ ting ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the doctors practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ris@@ er re@@ members , smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a little sad@@ ness has already felt it after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to stay in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients most of the time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the intern@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pressed myself before gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ sons and likes to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also set up at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of Interior , Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , the controls at the Hungarian border are maintained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still clear that anyone who wants to make an asylum application can do so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main focus is on the care and safety of the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people must know that we do not accept limit@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia sof@@ tens &quot; corridor &quot; - denied Slovenia
the Croatian government had previously informed that Slovenia would also want to leave incoming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and , under certain circumstances , er@@ ect cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
according to the minister of Interior Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however , did not see this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the supervision of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ians do not want to limit its borders to refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill out its commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced that the first refugees had already tried to leave the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id during the night hours to avoid the registration .
the Croatian police could pick them up in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik continuously adop@@ ts police vehicles with new refugees .
it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days his country comp@@ uted with about 4000 refugees , said interior minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo were transferred to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , agreed to Croatia and agreed on Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the Belgrade government , however , denied that it was the way people began to suggest certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do so , &quot; said it .
according to the media reports , a first bus with approximately 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id in the morning , in the course of the day more buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the passengers had been on the way through Serbia all night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border that was about 500 kilometers away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could actually lead to a postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west @-@ situated course .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive border control capabilities &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared plans for possible exceptional situations in the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call the details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you carry out strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently provided a good testimony to the country as far as the standard of border controls is concerned .
on the Serbian side there are still some 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to the reports of the media reports , they had spent the last night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain closed .
it is still unclear whether the remaining refugees will continue to travel to the Croatian border .
the Serbian Minister of the Interior , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic , tried to calm Wednesday early on a local evi@@ ction in Hor@@ gos : he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for premature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not currently be a very high number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not possible to say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers to avoid migrants - Dan@@ ger@@ ous - alternative routes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , private Hungarian refugee aid workers have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe : in parts of the border region there are still not cleared mine fields 20 years after the end of the Croatian war .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .

the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Help is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and conversations like the volunteers .
while some pedestri@@ ans spontaneously access the chal@@ k and &quot; affir@@ m my life , &quot; &quot; stop the war , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; do not suffer long , &quot; others remain short , read , say sentences like &quot; I &apos;m not yet , &quot; and then go on .

F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial outlook for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the Gi@@ ant Gi@@ ant lowered his outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his bo@@ d@@ ging service .
the company also said that it plans to hire approximately 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for vacation .
at that time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by 2.5 percent in pre @-@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said a win between $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the financial year ending next May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast .
analysts expected a total of 10,@@ 84 $ , according to a fac@@ t@@ set survey .
the lower forecast is despite the price increases that are 4.@@ 9 percent on average and effective on 4 January and despite higher sur@@ charges for heavy and large packages collected from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result will increase compared with the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and because of growth in online stock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delivers solid earnings if you consider the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
plans for vacation rentals have been announced a day later than the rival U@@ PS , which plans to hire from 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , roughly the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just below the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve analysts questioned by Z@@ ack Investment Research .
sales rose by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six analysts asked analysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a decline in international priority shipping , which brought sales in its unit Express shipment to stagn@@ ate .
but the boom in online shopping increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , net sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
express Un@@ ity recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while earnings fell due to higher labour costs in the freight business .
in pre@@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares sank by $ 3.@@ 85 , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .
on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on its most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to raise the benchmark for the first time in almost a decade .
a mur@@ al of the United States rises threatening about them at the end of the decorated two @-@ story se@@ eding hall .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold mandate from Congress : maxim@@ ising U.S. employment and prices here stable .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision which is too narrow to predict it . it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled by unprecedented incentives provided by the close @-@ to @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy show that it is growing solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets might frigh@@ ten the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to increase this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal government bonds - and even if it is only a quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they see , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise interest rate , the increased in@@ security around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which sec@@ ures itself the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists , recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg , predicted an increase in interest this week .
however , the financial markets expect a wait of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that only shows a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed raises the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts blow the blow , promising that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage Value rose by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed policy holds up the set this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that they won &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that an interest rate would calm the financial markets because they would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
one month ago , the F@@ ed seemed good to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the rate was expected .
although job creation slow@@ ed in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % in the past month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level which the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics .
but the financial markets around the world gathered at the end of the last month , after China had de@@ valued its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage Value fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would cur@@ b global growth .
the market has recovered something this month , whereas D@@ ow is now about 10 % below the peak of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences affect complex calculations when interest rates should be increased .
&quot; if events on the financial markets and the news of the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred over the past few weeks , they would tigh@@ ten the re@@ ins in this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US Central Bank .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to better get a grip on the effects .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; global economic health is not one of the major concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be considered technically in its decision @-@ making . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in the end , the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
the mere hint of the director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; their monetary expansion , caused confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that apparently are not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ ier , member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who is campaig@@ ning for an interest rate , decisions made in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to reduce their interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited noticeable effects on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lack@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives cancelled these cuts .
the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability in the first place only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 Market Stru@@ cture , &quot; said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on Inter@@ est Reporting of the Bank of England .
the recent turbul@@ ence does not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I certainly don &apos;t want to get into the situation where they are afraid of an interest rate because markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , president of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not believe it should be ahead of time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little Life Assistance for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees are coming to Germany these days .
to give you a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
there are also a number of people in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with both body and soul .
she still likes to teach with her 74 lessons .
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum application at the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , this is quite different from a real school .
Brazil &apos;s pap@@ di@@ at@@ rics society Rio Grande funds nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS attempts to enligh@@ ten women on how important a good diet is during breast@@ feeding . it does so with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck breasts that are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build up a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should do .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet actually affects women &apos;s genes and protects them from tum@@ ors .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions to the new Bern@@ ried sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction contract for the 2.3 million Euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be fl@@ atten@@ ed for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited turn@@ around building at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ complex is advancing step by step : in the recent municipal council session , the completed construction proposal was unanim@@ ously agreed without major discussions .
previously , among other things , the Panel had adopted an application for an &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; ( &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; ) from the current development plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission of a special form regarding the roof structure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with a non @-@ bearing first and roof top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be erected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the planned use of the roof surface for solar plants is the background of the planning : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the mayor of Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was again about the roof @-@ tilt , which is to lie below ten degrees for energy reasons - unlike in the development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan for the a@@ version of the roof did not allow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; whereby the Bern@@ ried municipal council is usually more restric@@ tive in terms of freedom of eman@@ cipation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the turn@@ around is not a recur@@ rent project : &quot; we do not create preced@@ ent , &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger said .
the gymn@@ asi@@ um building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
around 2.3 million euros are calculated at the expense .
subsidies are expected from the promotion of school and l@@ ati@@ tude .
in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 @-@ metre @-@ wide hall is now presented to the Land@@ rats@@ amt for testing .
clinic P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will become the new Medical Director at the Hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is seen by the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , which confirmed Coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , a decision is made by the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans were to be implemented , then all of the 50 employees at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg would continue to work .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the still existing In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are available .
the employees who do not work with Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees are informed of the plans .
Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Klinik since the beginning of the year , has initiated the change and is now switching to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
on the question of who should succeed , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take the lead from October 1st and moved to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a broad@@ ening of the offer in the area of internal medicine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the inside .
over the next two years , fishermen with his team , if the Supervisory Board appro@@ ves , will lead both houses , until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ schaft , which still has 35 beds , is to be finally closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
so far , the district had planned this for 2018 , when the ongoing rehabilitation at the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital has been completed .
district coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ours that the house , which is owned by the Federal Court , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum @-@ raising companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shut off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer , on the move to Le@@ ch , who was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a real perspective for the house in which Fischer has been working as chief doctor for over 30 years has not given it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ au &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was repeatedly threatened by closure in recent decades , det@@ ach@@ ments were closed , for example , surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .
the hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are called for tonight ( 20.@@ 15 o &apos;clock ) at the Berg@@ ischer HC .

hunting accident with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured by shots during their corn harvesting on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several hunters were employed , as the police informed .
after a shot , a 63@@ - and 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered grave injuries and were brought to hospital .
how exactly it could come to the accident was unclear at first .
the police investigation was established .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the body of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who has been missing since Saturday .
in the inter@@ rog@@ ation the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their cor@@ p@@ ses were thrown into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who has been missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to violent crimes .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as public prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police ha@@ sten@@ ed on Wednesday .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , also captured on Tuesday evening , is deemed to be an act of action , which according to the statement , and the investig@@ ator led to the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ se .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after they did not arrive at home after a visit to Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the evening after a visit to Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
when searching for the young woman , the investig@@ ators initially met with the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
in the case of inter@@ rog@@ ations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tances of the missing persons , a suspi@@ ci@@ ons were finally found against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the presum@@ ed perpetr@@ ator led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the body was found .
according to the authorities , the det@@ ain@@ ee reported to the authorities that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was killed and the cor@@ p@@ ses laid in the channel .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to be led to the o@@ at fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put a stop to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; information on the circum@@ stance of the facts should bring the further investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees need accommodation : study warns of lack of housing
the situation in the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for a affordable place to stay .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles in the German housing market have long since begun .
with the incoming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units have to be built every year by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this results in a study commissioned by the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are completed in Germany this year .
thus 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seek@@ er in an initial reception .
many come to the housing market and enter the long queu@@ es in front of the apartment rentals .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers resi@@ ded in the last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to rising numbers of refugees .
the study also makes significant savings in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany moves a lack of housing in front of itself , which is getting bigger from year to year .
currently around 77@@ ,000 units were already missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals therefore lived in large cities necessarily in WG @-@ rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults remained un@@ willingly in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the dol@@ drums on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita has fallen for the first time in recent years .
in order to solve the problem , the &quot; social housing construction &quot; alliance proposes a new start .
in doing so , new incentives should boost the social housing sector .
thus , on the basis of the basic income tax , the tax rate for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats could be suspended .
in addition , attractive fiscal depreci@@ ation options are required according to the Alliance .
the subsi@@ dy programme for the state bank Kf@@ W refugee status is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the approximately 300 million euros were already rec@@ alled on Monday evening at 18@@ 4 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
there is practically no transit to Hungary , since more and more refugees choose the way through Croatia .
Zagreb announces that it will pass through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is still dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have spoken to the Sloven@@ ian Interior Minister , and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the suppression of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees went to Croatia to move from there to Western Europe .
500 people came across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian Television Station RT@@ L .
Hungary had blocked its border for refugees on the day before .
new laws , which came into force on the same day , practically eliminate the need for decent asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian prime minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can go through and we prepare ourselves for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police attacked the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia .
most of the media reports came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both by bus and taxi to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ b border , the refugees do not come across borders .
there are other dangers for this : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 90@@ s .
mine clear@@ ers should now quickly create a safe passage .
after the closure of the border , there are hardly any more refugees coming to Hungary .
on Tuesday the police counted 3@@ 66 attacked people .
shortly before the end of the gate on Monday , there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws define the overcoming and damage of the border zone as a crime .
35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated in Sz@@ eg@@ ed , Hungary .
the condemned threatened prison sentences of up to five years and expul@@ sion from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the &quot; Trans@@ it@@ ons &quot; set up on the border , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees .
practically nobody has a chance to get asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian views , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers begin to clean up .
they collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people left at the road@@ side over the past few weeks .
barrier gates were disman@@ tled and one of the recording camps at the border site was rebuilt .
no one wanted to comment on the goal of this reconstruction .
after closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is only a few refugees .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
however , about 20,000 migrants were still in the country according to government information .
in Salzburg approximately 1400 people are waiting for the continuation of the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the instruction of German authorities .
in Frei@@ lass@@ ing , small groups of refugees met on foot regularly .
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy with the clearing after the bridge on Sunday when ten people suddenly stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail transport with Austria on Sunday because of the flood of refugees , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and drove the rocks together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
before we first st@@ oked the unexpected guests , with snack and drinks .
we said immediately , we bring it by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview .
they were very grateful .
a man could not take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that made us very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers had moved from an ICE to a regional train in the direction of Passa@@ u on Sunday evening in W@@ els , after the announcement that the railway traffic was stopped to Germany , but still to try the border .
but the regional train was shut down at the river Inn before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the cross @-@ border is generally high in the course .
the bridge @-@ fest combined with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably , the day before a two @-@ leg press spor@@ ti@@ ly - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends a further tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in the camp right away in the construction of structures that ensure humanity , our German Chancellor has publicly and publicly highlighted the Hungarian government &apos;s position in the sphere of national socialism .
leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic states in the border areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees too must find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yellow land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that she has invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge to establish decent conditions for prot@@ esters in view of the sustained flow of refugees and the approaching winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter@@ proof lod@@ g@@ ings
Konrad tries to do all his hands with the refugee shelter .
Christian Konrad is used to having his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to place lod@@ g@@ ings for thousands of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chaos in the first reception centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported on his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the accommodation of 20,000 refugees , who had come to Austria on Monday , was carried out without great confusion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; masterpiece &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Konrad reck@@ ons with a demand of 85@@ ,000 districts in the he@@ ur@@ iger year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 establishments will need to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 shall provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are more refugees , we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a drum without soil , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already had talks with the govern@@ ors of the country .
they would have assured him of creating neighbour@@ hoods for the coming refugees too .
&quot; it &apos;s good in Upper Austria , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
tomorrow , there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , and it will be clari@@ fied how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Asyl@@ um Co@@ ordin@@ ator also sets great expectations in the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Help us as we . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
individuals can easily offer accommodation on the platform .
in addition , it is hoped for hotels that are vac@@ ant in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the accommodation standards as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency it cannot be that lod@@ g@@ ings have to comply with a certain amount of the towel rail or the size of the duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply for a temporary period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Interior Ministry , in contrast to the Interior Ministry , Konrad substanti@@ ates with his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an elderly gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the power of persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Con@@ rad and Mai@@ er do not charge the Republic as they themselves declared .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
the own quest for lod@@ g@@ ings has not been successful so far .
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
however , there are apparently problems with the permission .
Linz is calling for a better division
for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as the Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as the parties concerned are currently unable to accommodate these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for emergency , however , further sites should be checked for their suitability .
the city chief is critici@@ zing the division of refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also make their contribution here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boundaries are not blocked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a long telephone conversation with Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , governor Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday corro@@ des further proceedings in the refugee issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er has assured me that the German borders will not be blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the further departure of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there are now the appropriate border controls .
for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist .
the protective seek@@ er , however , would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once again , P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue from the other EU member states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fact that Austria is now also carrying out checks on its borders is &quot; a logical consequence &quot; for P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger from the action of the Germans .
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Linz industrial line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six stor@@ eys of the office and production building , the publicly listed IT Group S &amp; T is moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in Star@@ tup @-@ companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard and later also to acquire some .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - what Nieder@@ haus@@ er expects a lot : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
EUR 1.7 million has been invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the Federal Government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of residual space in the building are already rented , for a further 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second business in the arcade
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
actually Jut@@ ta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
this project had to hand over the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , she now gained a new business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the store , in which she sells bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes from different manufacturers , everything is now about women &apos;s hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are starting from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
before that , several weeks have been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have long considered whether I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among other things , the decision was , among other things , that the producers of Fur@@ la , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location on which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who even has Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has put Br@@ eit out of her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I like most if something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why such a woman is in rap@@ ture when seeing a beautiful hand@@ bag , can not answer the woman with the latest security .
perhaps it &apos;s because a nice bag upgrades each outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s ancestors came from a place whose inhabitants are called investors .
this property also connects some with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ setting .
as far as x@@ en@@ opho@@ bic is concerned , journalists are concerned or gaps in knowledge are revealed in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US Pres@@ i@@ dency promotes the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cuts well .
this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ öhn@@ fres@@ ur &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a term for many in Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine road . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people in the 1200 inhabit@@ ant town are related to it over tens of corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pfalz : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the villa@@ gers think of being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it exciting , but aren &apos;t so impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt Art , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has made an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous young@@ sters , to whom beside Tr@@ ump the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , also comes to word in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to think that &quot; Tr@@ ump &quot; is already a bit a big mouth , &quot; Wen@@ del says .
inci@@ dently loud the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circum@@ ference , &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in High German : the len@@ ders , she says .
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the don@@ ors .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a place for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
first real estate operations in New York were the corner@@ stone of the real estate group .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed due to the Bavarian State , which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at the time .
he did not take Tr@@ ump , because he was cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared the start of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal immig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes distinctive statements of the descend@@ ant .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a border wall to sc@@ are illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the pol@@ em@@ ates , this is not so symp@@ a@@ thetic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote relationship of Tr@@ ump ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The grand@@ ma was a born tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the retired win@@ emaker se@@ greg@@ ates the American more , &quot; he is always so excited . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ , which generally arrived well .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine this from Donald &apos;s , &quot; the 68 @-@ year @-@ old says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they would find it better if he had no choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if this is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the legends at the time of his grandfather in the US would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wen@@ dels &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12 000 theat@@ rical go@@ ers , also in the USA arous@@ ed interest .
the Upper Bavarian town of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain clim@@ ber village . &quot;
the 1800 inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday from the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing villages &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the neighbouring country , the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have at most 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sunrise is domin@@ ating the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in today &apos;s Today Show
Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rush to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report in connection with the loss of leadership of the liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts in the reviews for today .
N@@ ine &apos;s breakfast show was broadcast by the state capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull made the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Riv@@ ale Sunrise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , stuck in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international television programs , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Canc@@ un .
this down@@ side of the resistance didn &apos;t seem to play a part for Australian TV viewers , since Sunrise was able to generate 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators at the five major cities , compared to today &apos;s 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today announced a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , today , the gap to Sunrise was closed .
in August , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 3@@ 30,000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50.000 .
so far in September , sunrise is at an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change concern these morning people more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently @-@ wit@@ ted father , who decides to settle down with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening responded with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and easily hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two by The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 a.m. to 5 : 30 p.m. ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe yiel@@ ded an average of 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jump@@ ed to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia received 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour was full 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will confi@@ dently agree that Hot Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 5 : 30 p.m .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars which has not managed to over@@ take the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly clear who the Bachelor wins .
the woman who eventually ends with Sam Wood in The Bachelor was wrapped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked in with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows the day before three of them will be checked , you may have in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood holds his lips firmly sealed to the final on Thursday
all three women were ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and thereby called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , when the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last Rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their answers could become a game spo@@ il@@ age who won the heart of the brook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called them fast - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
from the first day , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a very simple relationship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed S@@ ams &apos;s energies , I felt they were pretty compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sarah is standing on Earth with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week made it clear that Wood could be &quot; the One . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now un@@ reserv@@ edly hired on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked who Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ led .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls in equal measure - it is a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broad@@ cast@@ ed on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent out requests for an impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bench when he lost a don@@ or as he did the Aus@@ sie @-@ rug@@ by league @-@ conver@@ t at his first Pun@@ t @-@ Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a punch @-@ return and also to the running game after a breach of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
he also strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ port@@ man Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his p@@ itt@@ led catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t with a punch that was restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian band had hoped for for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens once , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 , when a pass at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was still a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; free voters are calling for the hi@@ ring of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high numbers of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the F@@ W @-@ Herbst@@ kl@@ au@@ sage at Bavaria &apos;s schools , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned against a severe crisis at Bavaria &apos;s schools when there are not correspon@@ dingly new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; otherwise we will get recru@@ its in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the State Parliament faction of the Free V@@ als conven@@ ed until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune .
actually , totally different main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the free elec@@ torate @-@ meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject asylum will over@@ lay the clo@@ ister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN prot@@ ections for refugees in Syria , as was the case during the wars of Yugoslavia in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it &apos;s not going any further , we have to look at the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free Elec@@ toral leader . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W chief critic@@ ised that several states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards of federal states nationwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

4 people killed after police shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd who demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ stret@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Chief Executive Officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station with some of them throwing stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ ke said the police used tear gas and then shot in the air before they res@@ or@@ ted to rubber bul@@ lets .
20 police officers and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber bul@@ lets , of which it is known that they can kill , which are traditionally used as a less mortal alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern planes , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces being formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent alter@@ c@@ ations since 10 .
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal that has been ruled centrally for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but law@@ makers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators have voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and civil servants have said that the new constitution could come into effect on Sunday .
construction site planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ den Art Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4,000 square meter area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are no specific offers yet .
Em@@ den - Em@@ den &apos;s city wants to market an area of about 4,000 square meters in direct vicinity to the Art Centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
it is planned to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , commerce and housing .
they wait for appropriate offers , that is , the city .
which investor should be questioned is not yet clear .
accordingly , no contracts have been concluded .
the city Em@@ den had a part of the property , which is located on the Ring@@ straße / corner Große Straße , already bought several months ago and the building located on it can be demol@@ ished .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning of a holiday settlement on the small sea near Em@@ den is taking shape .
the Investor was publicly presenting plans for the project for the first time .
some residents are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure activities
for months the doors had been negotiated , p@@ onder@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday settlement on the small sea near Em@@ den are on the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prospective , medium @-@ sized company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; System @-@ Building &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the municipal development committee of the Em@@ de Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , who repro@@ ached the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end@@ edly went off from the system construction management to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet responded to all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ors now .
the ten to twelve million euros of expensive projects has been in discussion for months .
strong reactions among sea owners who had come to the meeting called out the pictures and new details of the desired hotel building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , marine owner and member of the board of advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , lam@@ ents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ ch that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears like some other project critics that traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; entire bus@@ loads must come to expect that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , what is happening on the well one hect@@ are area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still lacking , the development plans are also variable .

Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a double @-@ payment campaign that will raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who have over@@ rolled the European nations , as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the announcement of the donation call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark train and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global funds raised to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / have doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely due to the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many also escaped from the war @-@ torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly overweight diabe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if slightly overweight people with diabetes after losing weight loss live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , which wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss operations or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obes@@ e sur@@ geri@@ es have proven effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been conducted in people who are mor@@ ally obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in relation to size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c ul@@ cer - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I under those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
in the meantime , BM@@ I remained among those who received non @-@ surgical treatment of diabetes approximately at 29 .
among those who underwent surgery , 36 % of the diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus sever@@ ed completely and 28 % in part .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes completely dis@@ b@@ anded in only one percent and partially with only about two percent .
in addition , the results of controls in blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol were generally better in the &quot; surgical group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c &apos;s blood glucose levels that reflect blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write .
after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c fell from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as it is reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease the mortality rate in five years , says leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team compared the average results for the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ ro@@ omy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and reported a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavy people in Sweden that surgery results in a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people who underwent an obesity operation , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soothing for people with a BM@@ I below 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long for people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a topic that is increasingly attracting attention in Bell@@ et@@ r@@ istik : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly , meets after years the s@@ warm of her youth , and this falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recent novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally , we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel might be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the main professional author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is happy that she could place a literary memorial to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East lies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader insi@@ sted on ending violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of continuing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the UK in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in cop@@ ing with the crisis , he emphasized that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you must think about long @-@ term solutions , such as genuine peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we need to think about how the killing in their countries is reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama spoke to the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 and asser@@ ted that the violent reaction of the US pulled a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the way to solving this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he continued violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of hand dis@@ infection by children over the last 4 years
poison control centres in the United States report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age that take strong alcoholic hand dis@@ infection drugs , such as Georgia &apos;s Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia &apos;s Po@@ ison Center , the cases of income of hand dis@@ infection in children under 12 years of age who report toxic control centres increased from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are getting more and more involved in these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them are going to leave in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said that some children deliberately drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how you@@ ths drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants just because of a cheap experience .
te@@ ens allegedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wash in order to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the most attractive ( hand dis@@ infection agents ) are the ones that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent , which are very appealing for children .
hand dis@@ infection products contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
very few sp@@ lashes of alcohol can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning especially in infants .
&quot; it &apos;s highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the toxic emergency centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 transmitter in K@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave a si@@ p of whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand dis@@ infection agent within reach of children , and when children come to it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently took four sp@@ lashes of after straw@@ berry scent @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant in the school , was brought to an emergency hospital .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally considered drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor , who treated them in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah lou@@ dly l@@ ul@@ led her words and was unable to leave when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen through alcohol and hit her head , &quot; said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and to store hand dis@@ infection products outside the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol pois@@ oning , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing hands dis@@ infection products containing toxic , non @-@ declared ingredients .
employees of health authorities suspected that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth grade in the state of New York planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by putting anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ex@@ iled them out of their room .
the police looked at the en@@ vy plan as &quot; j@@ amm@@ ers &quot; and demonstrated disciplinary action against the school authorities .

D@@ ons increase Celtic leadership to five points
Adam Ro@@ on@@ ey &apos;s El@@ f@@ meter in the first half gave Aber@@ deen a tight victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e , so that the d@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between himself and Celtic .
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
there are rum@@ ors about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glas@@ gow , which was spontaneously rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insi@@ sted that he and his team mates are not under increased control , as they prepare themselves for the confrontation with the Dutch leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football bore Dutch - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland , they are not highlights of Celtic games anymore and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here talk not only about the return of the ran@@ ger .
they speak about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of excitement in the old @-@ fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic people have to fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat against ten @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , who now ranks promin@@ ently at the top of the table with a five @-@ point lead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel it exactly this way - but we have to go on .
we really need the support of Celtic , because that makes the players better .
standing together is so important .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January Transfer Window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players coming in the summer have this high season time to integrate what you &apos;ve seen with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said and insi@@ sts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no integrity in question , I have not commented on performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le
the in@@ cor@@ rigi@@ ble Hi@@ bee was instructed after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive texts about ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the Ros@@ eb@@ urn area of Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh der@@ by in Ty@@ n@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the stor@@ mer , and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s safe to say that I do not return to Ty@@ v@@ ast@@ le if it doesn &apos;t play for Celtic Glas@@ gow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tann@@ en@@ ce Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United &apos;s Executive Board still has confidence in the management team to turn things - but it is clear that the decline has to end on the playing field .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the guys back to Tra@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es is happy to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ beautifully win &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Hamilton . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team of Aber@@ deen had to fight desper@@ ately against Hamilton Ac@@ cies to see a seventh successive League victory , bringing them a lead of five points ahead of Celtic on the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ on@@ ey &apos;s El@@ f@@ meter in the first half .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in tro@@ phy games or songs that won &apos;t win games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while in the United Kingdom it is rising overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above that of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the figures for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland was 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken bo@@ thered the process
because security guards could not bring peace , the staff called the police .
only with the use of pepper spray the function@@ aries could put the stur@@ geons in custody .
a breath alcohol test gave a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 0,@@ 89 per mil@@ le .
the child was picked up by his mother .
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old had 2,@@ 15 per cent and initially remained in custody .
why I &apos;m witness@@ ing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
somewhat later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day came closer I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and as often more applications are available as seats , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery will take place in order to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of medi@@ ums from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will find it un@@ emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps closest friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner what he wants and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could have put it better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I &apos;m doing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations work against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter from the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please refer to the series of pod@@ casts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go into all details here again .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the act .
but I believe that there is a strong possibility that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters you can contact .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death .
man after wet police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the Cann@@ ing River
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he persu@@ aded the man of the Cann@@ ing River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang down the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters from a police officer who tried to &quot; persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale was called on Tuesday for a breach of a house in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape in the direction of Cann@@ ing River .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned to a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negotiating . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ ine .
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car to the dit@@ ch to escape alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired local people to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards were trying to spy on him and thre@@ aten to finish racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria have tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching by Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt tu@@ sni@@ ff probe in Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he held back 18 months because of the sp@@ ying accus@@ ations and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I spent a long time on it , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it was going on .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said .
tonight I will go home and sleep well .
I want to go about my head raised and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be more trainers .
then I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously M@@ oo@@ dy had let the bomb blast in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago , Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they seem to believe that I am a fraud .
if this is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses , because they failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ fo@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this and are still today .
should this bring me to the view that it will be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave cow@@ ard@@ ly and makes people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say can now be thought about .
but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that really makes me sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will exercise pressure on them and urge them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the instructor &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have developed with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said that he said he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ but@@ ted Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the rac@@ es@@ days treatment rule &quot; laugh@@ able &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse debate , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my colleagues wrong@@ ly applied mud on the leg .
it could have been like last night .
it could have been so yesterday the whole day , which was also like that .
but it was also the same on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an examination of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here &apos;s too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
man arrested after driver flight
on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a collision with a cycl@@ ist and subsequent driver flight in Cob@@ ram .
the cycl@@ ist was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after he was hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley Highway .
the police said the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured rider .
on Monday , a 50 @-@ year old man from N@@ ath@@ alia visited the Police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on .
he is expected to be indic@@ ted for driver flight and assistance and other traffic off@@ ences .
the cycl@@ ist , a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man from Cob@@ ram , remains in the hospital . he is in a stable condition .
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy strikes against ri@@ vals for claims on ring battle
&quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has called criticism of the tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbitr@@ ators allowed the Storm player &quot; Ring Games &quot; with his team during the great storm @-@ win in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co Trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a hardly covered note to the storm team after his team reached the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; pattern &quot; of the rug@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the fli@@ ck@@ ling of his team and said that they were just concentrating on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while tac@@ kling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team vo@@ iced him with confidence , as it means they were worried about being hit by the Storm Team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s time and time again - I haven &apos;t heard Tr@@ ent Robinson say about ring fights when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we haven &apos;t changed anything about our defensive system or the techniques throughout the year . but over the past six weeks , we have made our contact with Tac@@ arina a real focus , and this has brought about the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not used to losing it , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is funny how this occurs again and again at this time of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wa@@ yne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he will take care of a sh@@ it .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players at their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like these .
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters played a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against Cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks and no points something exciting ?
for me it is the game boards .
when they mention us , it means that in a phase we will meet them .
the Storm Team has released this weekend , as they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on Saturday night in the final final in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ deposit on drug delivery
a man who could possibly have a lifetime penalty due to his attempt to return to the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of 200,000 $ .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was watched as he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants at the marina in the morning and later at the Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house Café where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a possibly life @-@ long penalty for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the café could have been out of a harmless cause .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the danger of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he told the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ ection@@ ate explanations of the two people it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this alone won &apos;t be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against b@@ ail , under the conditions that he gives off his Australian and his Serbian passport , reports to the police daily and stops at an exit lock from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident at A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : cab tears apart
in case of a collision with three lor@@ ries on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe , a lor@@ ry driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had braking in front of a permanent construction site towards Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment , as the police informed .
the driver &apos;s cab crashed completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours to 2 p.m .
there was a loss of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to enti@@ ce pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es to send images
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ us used the telephone of an 11 year old girl to ask for pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when she fell asleep in an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of continuous pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hands of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
the police looked after the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; concerning &quot; web research that used terms for the search for in@@ decent images of children .
Ho@@ gg then claimed to the officials that he did it as it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le on the Internet &quot; and he then &quot; preten@@ ding to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be an ad@@ diction - that he is addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that searching on the computer were carried out by him , but said it was done because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman in order to frigh@@ ten pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es .
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he would then see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was on trem@@ bling and crying .
she then saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and faced the defend@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation used to speak with girls who looked much younger than he .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the indictment , having taken in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year , on 25 January of this year , and not to appear before the court for a hearing on 24 March this year .
counsel lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg would not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , since one could argue that &quot; there is no substantial sexual element &quot; in his crime .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work .
in this case , Ho@@ gg was granted a security deposit but was held in custody due to hear@@ ings to other pending cases .
he was still included in the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of judgment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad users &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turn on small border cross@@ ings to Germany &quot; &quot; &quot;
more and more refugees are picked up outside the major control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many floo@@ d@@ gates close to smaller border cross@@ ings for fear of discovery and arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 1000 refugees were taken up along the river Inn River Inn in the districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they had come to the German side by foot over bridges and reser@@ vo@@ irs .
there they are received by Federal Police officers and forwarded to the registration .
according to federal police figures on Wednesday , more refugees arrived at the Munich Main Station in comparison with the start of the week on Wednesday .
around 700 people had arrived in the state capital until 8 : 00 a.m. , said one speaker in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls at the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city .
Stuttgart : drop@@ out of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the southwest
meteor@@ ologists warn of storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , hot sea air flows into the country , distributed by the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful low was the prec@@ ursor of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was dra@@ gged from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in recent days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , up to Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Boden@@ se@@ reis with bu@@ cks from 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
on Friday , the sun can be seen again longer .
the crowd makes it : every two years , the car makers at the IAA show their novel@@ ties .
in 2015 , it is above all a movement in the compact cars that are currently particularly well @-@ selling .
cars from the compact class are currently in great demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the German Federal Tax Office ( KBA ) in August alone in this segment .
this is also reflected in the IAA ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the futur@@ istic concept vehicles and new luxury car and luxury cars , many new compact models will be presented this year .
one of the greatest premi@@ eres for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra , which will be show@@ c@@ ased at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive either .
Opel is launching an entry below the largest competi@@ tor VW Golf , starting at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra will cost € 16 9@@ 90 .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
furthermore , the H@@ esse offers further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp for the first time also three @-@ cylinder petrol engines .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Kom@@ bi , which can also be seen at the IAA .
and what will be done next to the Astra at the International Motor Show ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e can be seen exclusively as a five @-@ door figure in a conventional and an accentu@@ ated sporty GT version .
in the trade it comes next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 is brand new in the segment .
the Nissan un@@ installer wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
with its curved lines , the compact Infin@@ iti adapts to the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
on offer there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications at 170 New@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not brand new , but completely renewed is the compact car model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA .
outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ger put on the front part of the front : here the radiator grill was re@@ drawn and the modified spotlight was equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ otain@@ ment system has been moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons is reduced by a touch screen and Apple Car@@ Play is for the first time integrated .
at the IAA in the compact class , there are also a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the upgraded Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are deser@@ ted
the Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex @-@ prisoner of the legal detention facility Te@@ gel , which was lod@@ ged in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , det@@ ain@@ ees are basically entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
this was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , they can even hope for money if they were confined to confined spaces within a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
in this way , an ex @-@ prisoner was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : he was housed in a single cell with around five square metres floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated .
after that , the man who , according to his lawyer , was now on the free foot , had been moved to a larger cell .
his duty of office because of the un@@ worthy conditions of detention against the country of Berlin failed .
however , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges took up the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al and returned the case to the re@@ trial .
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber Court decision now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons only a few days of compensation are decisive for the compensation , a declaration of compensation was given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cl@@ utter of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber Jud@@ gement must now clarify the amount of compensation for money .
in the past , the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners .
thus they did not speak to a det@@ ain@@ ee in April because he was imprisoned naked in a cell .
according to a Dec@@ ision of 2011 , human un@@ worthy is also the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet .
furthermore , in addition on Wednesday , Karlsruhe confirmed the Berlin Court of Justice , which had certified a prisoner in a Par@@ allel Trial in a Par@@ allel Trial in November 2009 .
the then pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff was lod@@ ged every day for three months between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Car@@ ls@@ bad case .
in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons had also hit the head@@ lines due to lack of staff .
prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , aggres@@ si@@ veness rises , even in fights , it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Justice Press Office , 21 bodies in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of young lack , 19 will drop off in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what to do in Germany ?
according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , around 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) . Germany is even able to take up a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll say again and again : we can do this , and we can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany gives the following overview .
according to various forecasts between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are needed annually - for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it was built up to now ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all with affordable rental properties : every year 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social dwell@@ ings fall out of the rent price , and these particularly favourable apartments will also apply for refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
this is far too little from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80@@ ,000 social housing needs to be built every year and the federal government would have to invest USD 6.@@ 4 billion annually .
on the one hand , scientists and federal mini@@ stries agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be asked about their qualification systematically in order to help them get started , Claudia Walter critic@@ ises the project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation .
but for the integration of refugees it is crucial that they find jobs in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; admission society &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , says Mig@@ rations@@ researcher Dietrich th@@ än@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany , according to the Thr@@ one , there has been a political turn@@ around : from the prohibition of labour for refugees to recognise work .
whereas there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence requirements that asylum seekers are confined to a residence .
in society - also because of the shortage of skilled labour - a majority of the points of view have prevailed that refugees should be able to access the labour market faster .
lack of knowledge of German is a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market .
so far there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often medi@@ ated through personal contacts .
the building of networks is therefore , in the opinion of Thr@@ än@@ hardt , the Royal Road to the integration of labour .
the Berlin School Administration has found that only a few wing@@ ed parents give their children to Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; it is important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ eh@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators is to increase sharply due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase education capacities - for example by allowing more specialised schools .
students are prepared in the countries without knowledge of German in the classes .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate &apos;s suit@@ cases from the Berlin School Administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk appreci@@ ates that about 20 per cent of the refugees wish to study in Germany .
in principle no federal state forbi@@ ds asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception to date has been Berlin , Interior Sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; student willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for refugees with a residence permit or divor@@ ce do not receive any benefits after the asylum application performance act when they begin a study . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the latter generally do not receive any b@@ af@@ e since they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to vote .
patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years in order to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 this span shor@@ tens to 15 months .
this financing gap , too , needs to be closed , demands Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ essively submit to Islam the same rights as the churches have , and to further develop the existing state church law to a new state of religions .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic organisation of well @-@ being , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers in a professional manner .
the rights also include duties .
thus the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control possibilities .
this also includes the willingness to take heed to religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to off@@ end such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law into Arabic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; integration will in future be much more than today a topic of the whole of society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order for the majority society to change , the disman@@ tling of discrimination and rac@@ ism will be more urgent .
Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination zone and a universal gender equality law for a decade .
but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U @-@ M@@ ord@@ line showed that the rac@@ ist motif was systematically ignored by the police and authorities .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants &quot; organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ White Germans are demanding for a long time and why international agreements like the anti @-@ rac@@ ism conflict in Germany have to become a reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens should take advantage of their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generally , Germany is able to provide medical care to the refugees previously expected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as man@@ power and capacities are concerned , we create this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery ur@@ ges all the newcom@@ ers to hand in health cards right away .
services rendered could be rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated later with the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to save as many people with the restricted catalog of services that the asylum application law fores@@ ees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , the doctors are able to create the language barriers .
already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are becoming more aware of their diseases than other patients .
it is not only in clinics , but also in medical practices that interpreting costs would have to be taken over .
many refugees would also have helped with more general medical centres in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
among refugee children there are clearly more un@@ treat@@ able disabilities , and with the young people it is about HIV enlightenment .
but with the partially different diseases of the disease , German doctors are making clear of their training , but Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery writes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite attacks or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the medical committee , even relief in sight may be caused by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed educational system ; several refugees are even doctors .
in order to be allowed to practice , however , they must prove their qualifications and possibly take examinations again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill after estimates of the Federal Psycho@@ therapist Chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study by the TU München proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child is trau@@ mati@@ sed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder , among other things , suffer from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees have received psycho@@ therapy .
although mentally ill asylum seekers in social offices can make an application for psycho@@ therapy , treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social offices mostly property workers or doctors who are not trained for the psychological illness , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
with the new production &quot; Passion , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts .
the goal is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst looks into the man@@ ege on the brick .
&quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ trainer and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current management stage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more than 33 years the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
thus , the gift for inspiring the family is in the blood .
&quot; it is important for us to take away people from their everyday mo@@ ck@@ ery and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with a cosm@@ opol@@ itan flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says managing director Reinhard Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the Circus program convinces with talented artists from all over the world .
excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wi@@ t and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of silent films , the Cuban duo wants to easily record the Cuban duo .
light@@ ness and flexibility - they identify with these words .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is supposed to conquer women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
besides numerous salmon @-@ sal@@ ts , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with t@@ act and articul@@ ation .
balancing on a ball with the un@@ ic@@ ycle ?
no problem for He y@@ uan .
sli@@ der people are fascinated and frigh@@ tened at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascin@@ ates with its ag@@ ility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Steph@@ an@@ ies mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to different animal welfare organisations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst also commented : &quot; if it &apos;s not good for our animals , it doesn &apos;t work well either . &quot;
about 80 animals from five different continents are enjoying every match .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are aff@@ ection@@ ately called , is read by the eyes of every wish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena .
the first commandment therefore : good for the animals .
specially developed for her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land@@ P@@ ony@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in an enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1,@@ 200 spectators , we always do our best and are with all your heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst looks up to its ideas every day from 17 to 20 September daily at 5 : 00 p.m .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , for the performance at 5 pm the prices are reduced .
in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open every day from 10 am to 6 pm .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe positions a false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , desc@@ ended from a podium by a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case spread quickly over the social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by alleg@@ ations of opposition MPs that they would have received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with bo@@ gs .
in the last month they had rested it and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received text messages on their phones that warned them to interfere with Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; Death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told journalists to Mu@@ gabe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the Parliament members concerned that immunity will end in parliament , and as soon as they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for the politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the restructuring and saving efforts of the company &apos;s services .
later this year HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service activities .
the expected job cuts lead to a burden of over $ 2.7 billion as of the fourth quarter , &quot; said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , leader of HP and Chief Executive , who should lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; will focus on deplo@@ ying unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; explains the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard to produce electrical equipment and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage is known as the Si@@ licon Valley &apos;s birth@@ place .
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to manage the return of traditional computers to mobile devices .
the measure by HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field , which is based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ers must stand in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger emphas@@ ised Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only in September and if his rehabilitation follows plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four matches for England , and in view of his story , his participation in the next summer is certainly still uncertain .
the big shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pres@@ e@@ ason .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in contact with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also acknow@@ le@@ dges , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of arsen@@ als in 15@@ 7 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for arsen@@ al is that in six out of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 , they were one of the two Premier League clubs that have recorded most of the injury days .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes an improvement in the injury rate will last for the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a period of time , a time in which you have to strengthen your body and gain combat strength , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
arsen@@ al starts its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before the matches against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not traveled to Croatia , meaning Ma@@ th@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need it to take a little break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to advance by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign started in the last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken on Tuesday evening by an earthquake measuring 3,@@ 2 on the Richter scale .
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco , and remains driven by far @-@ reaching hope to lead the association to its first European cup triumph with its management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked at Arsen@@ al .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show , which gives us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the lack of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now even more desperate than ever has become , like suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , Camp@@ a@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Camp@@ a@@ ign Against a mis@@ erable life ) 2015 announced as the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture to question the men to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the fight to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school pupils with depres@@ sive symptoms found that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery were doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends once , so that friendship can work .
in the age of communication through social media , with its focus on style over substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation dominates .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much deeper .
and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was turned up@@ side down .
each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , shining through interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments in football matches in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can relate to it , even though they often hold back to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a staff of telephone pastoral care told me : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and at risk of suicide has shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness by talking openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
as much as my objective out@@ sider status over the phone may help people in moments of despair , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend to celebrate the day completely re@@ designed scenery , why not take your friends for a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you see someone sitting alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the total of 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to gr@@ ind Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ guy Cav@@ ani after his match against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets on Tuesday at his debut in the Champions League and helps PS@@ G to pass on to Malm@@ ö .
here are the game reports and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ guy Cav@@ ani took course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main launched its Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ Park Stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League de@@ but@@ s as PS@@ G player who brought the French champion to the way , but after that , they missed a number of opportunities before they finally raised their lead when Cav@@ ani got a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , since they do not only aim for the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs &apos;s team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his home town team and against the club , with which he started his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause our opponents problems and to look back relaxed even if there are certain things that we have to perfect over the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t score one or two more gates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team that could last weekend a 2 : 2 Un@@ decided in his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was stab@@ bed in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was described as the man who took PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over last month by Manchester United , and he pointed out why , when he entered Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind Malm@@ ö defense before he passed Johan Wil@@ and to the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who hit Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was a serious opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field .
but in addition to a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed Kevin Tra@@ pps post in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave himself up , with some mis@@ ses and bad connections , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was scrat@@ ched in the first half in the first half and then given up after Cav@@ ani had used him after re@@ bo@@ oting .
nevertheless he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a passport from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c who turned Di Maria into a shooting , which was given by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole ...
the second gate finally fell short of the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an had his sixth season tor after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k from Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö can come back in the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before replacement player E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi finished a gate at the end .
the trainer of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish league which has not the same level .
the qualifying games are not enough . &quot;
hats off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !

the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 P@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group .
concerns relating to long @-@ term growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices have declined by 20 to 40 percent .

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented change from FC Bayern in 2008
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
a few years ago , the FC Bayern was just ahead of the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times champion league winner , four times champion league winner , two times champion league champion , twice champion champion , twice world champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and joined the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now gu@@ esses that he was already in Barcelona before the European Championships in 2008 .
&quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça would sell me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won everything , we do nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered also the FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in memory : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ s@@ man took over the FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this today works for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola and I have played a great EM . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how the season 2008 / 2009 would have gone with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians across the entire distance on the lawn , folded the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the king @-@ class triumph at the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays a variety in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confronted the African film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes .
during a succession of Sunday night from HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown under@@ lined the need for alternative perspectives in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the cast of the film and not with the cast of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on insured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted with insul@@ ting un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! W@@ ow . okay &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian lined up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to encourage people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - as they treat the figure of the Harmony , &quot; Brown said at first .
the only black person , and she is a s@@ ut@@ te beaten by her white collar .
the producer of Dear White People turned out for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that her direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded in front of dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter user Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger over the clip , writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the head of social discussion .
after killing Michael Brown in 2014 by a white police officer , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement generated a national impact and urged the legislature and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against coloured obj@@ ections .
in February , the singer Prince made an all@@ usion to the movement during the launch of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album calm matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums always have their meaning .
in recent times , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation in response to the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ ets , who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowns the first champion
professional sports clim@@ ber and user guide Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete to win the American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 Million .
the competition show , which finished their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all levels of his obstacle course .
during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman , Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
the last task was climbing on a 75 @-@ foot climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten completed the task within the time he was the first ath@@ lete to finish the exhau@@ sting Phase 4 of American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed the challenge full three seconds faster , making him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard @-@ won victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 Million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had to live , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so all of a sudden .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he first ended the course at all , won &apos;t receive any prize money .
according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and changed life , it gets the grand gra@@ b@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;s getting a gru@@ dge about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he did .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be struck by someone , I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Isaac felt as if they had changed the roles .
America N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or has been renewed for an eighth season , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit tiger swe@@ ep past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were once one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but on Tuesday they played perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field .
the T@@ wins left a chance to climb inside a half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , although only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so hard to grasp on a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad mus .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held up his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two Inn@@ ings , then in the sixth and then again in ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit 6 times in the 1 / 3 inner ring and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is hard to throw at the bul@@ l@@ pen any game , and therefore I want to go quite concentrated into the game .
the design@@ ate tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two races , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was Mart@@ ine@@ z &apos;s first three hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sw@@ ung the battles well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist ) , looked clearly better at the bul@@ l@@ pen and he brought it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the back@@ yard at the end of the 7th Inn , the T@@ wins had their best chance to get back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon introduced his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ or to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy passed the wall , the only man he was confronted with , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run escape from the right @-@ handed bracket Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the finish @-@ run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third bass player Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play .
it was the 27th time in the Major League in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe has hit a Double Play
after adding a Garden @-@ Run at the end of the ninth Inn , Wall created an R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the status of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right @-@ handed guy stab@@ bed S@@ ano with three pit@@ ches for his fifth S@@ ava .
at the start of the game , Detroit prof@@ ited from an un@@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers scored three rings in the first two Inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been canc@@ eled before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after he had been missing more than a month because of a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning that I wanted , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches out there in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the first Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , Hus@@ him delivered a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play , who created a single &quot; up the middle &quot; on the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 success series with Run@@ ners in scor@@ ing position .
the third bass player Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single at the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers placed in the second one One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single by Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a big blow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not beat very well , but he got the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es found himself in a pitch Count , did not score points in the third inning before he was replaced by the reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four strokes .
comments : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the throwing school .
he is studied by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the list of injuries because of a shoulder break , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is painted by the vulner@@ ability list to compete against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was purchased in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing since August 20th because of a distortion in the right hip joint .
the tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games on target field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people who were here are then to be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , just like the city Wiesbaden hur@@ ried on Tuesday evening .
it counted between 450 and 750 arriving refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital had been prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1,000 refugees can temporarily stay there .
they shall then be distributed to other municipalities .
in the past ten days , 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse , responsible for the first @-@ time recording of the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Gie@@ ßen , have arrived in Hessen .
also Frankfurt and Han@@ au have set up emergency accommodation in sports halls due to the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference Wolfgang Isch@@ inger considers military action with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that the thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he proposed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective gaz@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the European states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was happy that the cup of a military involvement in Germany had passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict comes crashing on our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the spot for the refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria has again introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders .
Austrian Minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner explained on Tuesday evening in Austrian TV station ORF , no one will be sent back to Hungary .
also Germany did not send any refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , that &apos;s been agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement that Germany could pick up a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been talks between the General Director of Public Safety and Represent@@ atives in Germany .
they did not call them concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary .
their destination is mostly Germany .
chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , together with several other EU heads of state and government , applied for a special summit next week .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on a common approach in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers plan to take a new approach to the binding distribution of more than 120@@ ,000 refugees on Tuesday , 22 September .
in view of the strong refugee camp in Germany , the federal government wants to strongly support the countries in the first @-@ time recording and distribution of people .
the Federal Government will manage this together with the Länder , and at the end of the Tuesday evening , Merkel announced , after almost four hours of consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined that those people who needed protection would also receive it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if you don &apos;t have a perspective view , you can &apos;t stay in Germany too .
this view was unanim@@ ously divided in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now manage a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge force exer@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre @-@ long border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later , the government announced in Budapest that the border to Romania was to be crossed by a fence .
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wanted to prevent smu@@ g@@ gling badges from Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut through the fence .
according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports in Turkey , thousands of other migrants have embark@@ ed on their way to the Greek border .
room probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus
under the ice @-@ p@@ anz@@ er of Saturn &apos;s moon En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus , a global ocean flo@@ ats .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what researchers conclude from observations of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , the moon sub@@ mer@@ ges easily on its orbit around the ring planet .
this pi@@ geon @-@ movement is only small , but nevertheless too big for a continuous solid heavenly body , it is said in a message from Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state New York ) from Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; specialist sheet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a long time it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice ceiling of En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had already discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the south pole of Saturn &apos;s moon in 2006 , spinning the water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feeding the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ Ring of Saturn &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the south pole there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed then .
however , the extent of the hidden ocean was not clari@@ fied .
R@@ ama missing in 1860 for several weeks
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1860 München &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must do without Val@@ det R@@ ama for about a month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an examination showed an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury at the age of 27 , the association announced .
R@@ ama had already compla@@ ined about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Munich Li@@ ons , the diagnosis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expected four weeks of forced break &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we must think about it now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of an un@@ compromising professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , as a training guest , the six@@ ties initially presented a defensive stat@@ es@@ man .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract with the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at is currently &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opportunity to prove his skills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tor@@ ero Ru@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to team training next week after his conc@@ ussion .
the Austrian national player is scheduled to start running on Thursday .
Ok@@ ot@@ ie was injured in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) in a violent collision at the head .
against the first fears , however , he remained without a severe ap@@ pointing .
no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain lots of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but those who want to pay attention to their slim line are often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because man@@ goes contain relatively high sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
however , the exotic fruits are healthy : they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. How@@ ever , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor of beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
the person who eats the fruits thus supports vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too strong and pleasant to smell .
the shell colour alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then , of course , they taste pure or in sweet dishes .

the US parcel service U@@ PS again provides up to 9@@ 5000 aids for the Christmas business in the USA .
the company had already started recru@@ iting seasonal workers , U@@ PS announced on Tuesday .
first and foremost , drivers are being sought .
already last year U@@ PS increased its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5000 aids .
in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and its competi@@ tor F@@ ed@@ Ex had earlier arrangements since last year in order to be armed for the Christmas business .
in 2013 bel@@ ated deliveries had brought a harsh cri@@ tique of the parcel service .
first fo@@ iled storm , then striking cold front
in the coming night in the valleys of the Alps of the Alps the F@@ öhn breaks through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz announced on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night for th@@ urs@@ day the fo@@ eh@@ n blows partly with storm strength through the fo@@ eh@@ el valleys .
following F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front which brings powerful ra@@ ins , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature drop .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a strong southwest current .
on the north side of the Alps , the hair dryer ki@@ cks off through the valleys during the night .
the F@@ öhn blows until Thursday morning in the fo@@ eh@@ igh valleys with bends from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land with over 100 km / h .
the fo@@ eh@@ n can sometimes penetrate into the neighbouring Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and even hurri@@ can@@ es of over 120 km / h are possible on the mountains .
while in the north on Wednesday a stor@@ my hair dryer for summer@@ y temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow away at the alpine cre@@ ek .
here it is ra@@ ining , which stops until Thursday evening .
in total , over 100 litres of rain per square meter will be calculated to the south of the Alps over the next 48 hours , after considerable rainf@@ all has fallen over the last few days .
on Thursday morning the f@@ öhn winds off , as a result , a cold front winds with powerful , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east over Switzerland .
together with the cold front the wind refres@@ hes strongly as far as stor@@ my , and temperatures clearly go back .
the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south on the other hand it will be sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther square in Rome .
on Wednesday , in the presence of Mayor Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Luther &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now acknowledged as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the name was applied for by the work community of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es were often only able to live in secret through centuries as a minority .
in a symbolic way , the place becomes visible in a symbolic way that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) held himself as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city back then as a rotten source of sin .
according to historians , his negative impressions are likely to have encouraged him in his later fight against Rome .
Luther had then introduced the sch@@ ism of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his theses against the ab@@ yss .
hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the gil@@ ded crown of thorns is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now been published with gorgeous pictures .
at the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 pictures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 year old - which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : according to the respective themes , this can be quite dark .
for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective selection from the many themes of the book of all books .
cycles emerged that dev@@ ote themselves to subjects such as cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , commandments , or fa@@ ther@@ land .
the same goes for the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books .
and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ am@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
he interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into &quot; today &quot; into current contexts .
these texts are like verbal mirror of Al@@ ert &apos;s painting .
it is embedded between the original Bible quote by Martin Luther and a set by the artist who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation .
the jewelry cord comes with golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately the cause of the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family owned by the strict Protestant sovereign Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; education has already been done with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work on it , in order to be able to bear me again with the Lord &apos;s Father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second aim is to regain the art of art in a quick@@ est time : &quot; the perception of visual worlds is today marked by advertisement , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is displaced .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewers to &quot; fall into the images , &quot; letting them appear , discover and feel what force they have : &quot; the image is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ am@@ ost was in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; has always been a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ert &apos;s art : &quot; I like him to understand life with his pictures . &quot;
I have not taken care not to fully grasp the Bible , but have chosen the most important , also mysterious subjects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not a collaboration on eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ am@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here are the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ert &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and screen mur@@ als - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
construction of construction for BM@@ X s@@ ut@@ ure approaches
plans made , place found , company contracted , earth moun@@ ts for a circular course model@@ ed : one year later , almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X train was finished .
there were failures in politics and administration , especially among residents who did not want to tolerate the railway .
so hill slo@@ ped , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval was received in October , the first coun@@ cill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the Child and Youth Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another pause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B will expand its engagement for refugees until 2019 , while the Bundes@@ liga will mark a clear sign on the weekend .
the football responds to the wor@@ sen@@ ing situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its help in cop@@ ing with upcoming problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say in principle , it doesn &apos;t matter to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of interest to everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B director Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he inten@@ sely wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the Chanc@@ ellery next Wednesday and meet the Chancellor Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will surely play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and will help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must be politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association therefore extended its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Initiative for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Stiftung ensured that this program will continue until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the br@@ ink of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some Federal analysts also support this programme .
already this weekend , the 36 professional clubs put a clear sign when they will carry on the left tri@@ cot instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) the im@@ print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen , director of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama is all about , no one can see it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can make use of our bla@@ sting power , our influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the League &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on this Friday , the national team of the women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large shared work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license associations started their own projects in their places is great .
just as great is that small and small clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year and next year , the association together with the DF@@ B @-@ Sel@@ ection and the Federal Government provides € 300@@ ,000 for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have also called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP CEO loses sight of an accident in the event of an accident
according to several reports , the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
in the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell into a water @-@ glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he &apos;s almost ble@@ ed , fain@@ ted , then went out to the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP Co @-@ Fo@@ under Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could do his job .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; Platt@@ ner said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday issue ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to run the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer at the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can do something like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to wake up once you have fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen outside combat ...

he therefore comes as little as a reserve driver for the two Stam@@ mp@@ il@@ ot Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button in the after@@ shave at the weekend , just like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
soccer : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europa League have been defini@@ tively sm@@ ashed .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in Du@@ el with the FK Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19 : 00 / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately we cannot draw on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach left open : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ ck@@ les will not only change its stem position on the Re@@ us position .
so he announced a change on the goal keeper &apos;s position .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of master scho@@ oling Roman brus@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller will be used in all European league games in the future , Tu@@ lip has left open .
with a high probability , he will also contest the second game .
the for@@ sche statement by Mit@@ player Re@@ us that the final move for the BV@@ B in the European League must be the goal , considers mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl to comprehend : &quot; this is not so wrong with Marco . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants to lead the way for Germany
according to the German Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany is to be a technological pioneer when it comes to changing the car .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke at the IAA of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility era &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Frankfurt Motor Show . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the topic with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states that come together with representatives of industry at the IAA .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport , among other things , emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and spe@@ edy transformation on digital radio .
a test track is currently being built on the motorway 9 in Bavaria to test new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks being imposed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government wants to check the legal framework and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only sees the human being as a driver .
when automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads are only to be expected far by 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany value the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD transport politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied .
but German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still look skep@@ tical - much more than French or American .
a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of Dek@@ ra , conducted on AA on Wednesday , concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not believe in it at all in 20 years .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents count up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , 33 per cent in the US .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
following a survey of the Digital Association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey on all roads .
on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could represent at least 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 percent .
well , every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances left to the car .
Bol@@ l says team and double start at table tennis EM
according to the current status of the title battle of September 25 to October 4 , the Düsseldorf will only be able to open in the individual .
the final decision should be made no later than 22 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys learned it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough even without Timo to clin@@ ch the title , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said German coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championships in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time , Bol@@ l was on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor@@ ship date in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who launches the S@@ etz@@ list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also rec@@ alled the Euro 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; at that time Timo has been missing , and we have become European champion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should ori@@ ent ourselves to this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the world rank@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the great star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; today I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of hau@@ te cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen in the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation from September 18th , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his attitude towards a show of his person at the beginning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For me an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly ever @-@ op@@ aque work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
the show is not chron@@ ologically structured , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , for which a lot of effort was carried out : to dev@@ ote the d@@ olls , for instance , a sty@@ list was dedicated .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , 14 tons of material have kar@@ mic to Munich .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special highlight : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , timi@@ d fashion experiments of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his ted@@ dy bear and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
his parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later taught the designing of fashion himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
for his first fashion show he did not have to pay the models .
they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery rather than curtain - P@@ lau@@ tered tip as fashion niche
earlier we went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and spi@@ kes were produced in large quantities for customers who used them for example for blankets and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en company .
instead , fashion is again important .
in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ en lace fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , for accessories like bags and for regional costumes .
the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past styl@@ istic eras , is an increasing job potential .
those who don &apos;t use niche in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , it already accounts for half of all orders .
P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery industry association with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the last 15 years , some 80 percent of sales were broken off .
there is almost no more private specialist shops and wholes@@ al@@ ers .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
the mass @-@ ware is produced much cheaper today in the Asian region and is sold almost exclusively via chains .
in addition , exports are weak@@ ening , up @-@ to @-@ date to Russia and the US .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association seeks to score points on environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains from the nitrogen mill in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year we have a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this refers to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schne@@ e@@ berg branch of the University of Applied Arts in Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ dery and lace .
in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies that need to think above all economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , an existing design is often only slightly modified to hold a customer base .
a couple of years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historic snow@@ ball point .
at the same time , the machine bu@@ cks small spheres at some places .

now she uses the snow@@ ball point for her jewelry .
in an elaborate process , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the topic of P@@ lau@@ en lace - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who want a mem@@ or@@ abili@@ a .

XI ur@@ ges to open the economy more broad@@ ly for the world
the economy must open wide out@@ wards to promote growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group that was t@@ asked with steering the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should strive to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee on deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to promote new spin @-@ offs and promote reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , X@@ i said .

after the statement a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment .
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
the initiative is of importance as it assign@@ s a greater role to the market in the allocation of resources , guarantees a legally @-@ state business environment and open the market more open , said the statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to the companies and make sure companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open government controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;

EU wants to double the mercury limit in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and thus provide consumers with a much higher dose of the nervous tox@@ in .
the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which has a corresponding working paper from the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed on to pregnant and small children , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as sh@@ arks or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish , are to be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
however , large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish are already so strongly polluted with mercury , that on the basis of the still valid limit values , approximately 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ comprehensible .
in return for this e@@ asing , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to intensi@@ fy the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because smaller cem@@ et@@ fish , such as car@@ p , are usually so low that they already comply with the scheduled maximum values already today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de distra@@ ction that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal which is highly toxic to humans , which accumulate mainly in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish through the food chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even small quantities can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cause damage to the nervous system especially in un@@ born damage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage in view of the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health risk of the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury passes mainly through the burning of coal into the environment .
according to a written reference from the Federal Ministry of the Environment , German coal @-@ fired power plants , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bock , issued more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount issued in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish , for example in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube , was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and nationwide &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted from the paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
