&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures to be applied when implementing the provisions of part I on the safegu@@ arding measures .
the purpose of the preventive measures laid down in this Convention is the timely detection of significant amounts of nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear waste bodies for unknown purposes as well as deter@@ rence from such a det@@ achment by the risk of early detection .
to enrich the target set in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a preventive measure of fundamental importance , associated with the spatial input and observation as important supple@@ mental measures .
the technical completion of the audi@@ ts by the organisation is carried out by an explanation in which the quantity of material allocated for each material balance zone is specified for a specified period under specification of the accuracy limits for the specified me@@ gen .
in carrying out their audi@@ ts , the organization makes after article 3 full use of the security system of the community .
the Accounting and Control System of the Community for Nu@@ clear Material in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
in the application of their security measures , the Community will make use of the methods and measures of the following kind and , as far as it is necessary , fores@@ ee how they are more closely determined and expe@@ dient in the supplementary agreements :
a ) a measurement system for the determination of the amounts of preserved , produced , lost , lost or otherwise from the stock of remote core material and stock quantities ;
B ) the evaluation of reproduci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of tran@@ smit@@ ters and receivers ;
e ) procedures for assessment of non @-@ measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and reporting system that evalu@@ ates the core material inventory for each material balance zone and the changes in this material including one - and outputs of the material balance zone ;
g ) precau@@ tions to ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) procedures for reporting of reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the measures taken in this Convention do not extend to material in mining or ore preparation .
B ) Ur@@ an - or th@@ orium @-@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described in letter c ) , is introduced into the States , so the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , provided that it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) Nu@@ clear material , which is suitable for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is produced , or is introduced into the states in a subsequent phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , is subject to the other measures mentioned in the Convention .
a ) The security measures envis@@ aged in this Convention are terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . however , if the provisions stated in Article 11 are not fulfilled , the Community is not possible or desirable for residues from residues provisional or desirable , so the organization and community shall consult each other on the use of appropriate security measures .
B ) The security measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the Organization and Community notices that this core material is virtually non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able .
at the request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es the following core material from the security measures in accordance with this Convention :
a ) special spl@@ itting material when used in grams - or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) Nu@@ clear material when it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which lies above 80 % .
at the request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es core material , which would otherwise be subject to security measures in accordance with this Convention , of these safegu@@ ards , provided that the entire quantity of nuclear material liber@@ ated in the States amounts to no point at any point in time than
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special pal@@ atable material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ an@@ ium , calcul@@ ates through multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ an@@ ium and depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) Tw@@ enty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or less ;
should the free nuclear material be processed , processed or stored together with nuclear materials that are subject to , processed or stored under the provisions of this Convention , precau@@ tions for the re @-@ use of the security measures are taken on that material .
the Community meets with the Organization of Supp@@ le@@ mentary agreements necessary to the extent that is necessary for the successful and effective provision of the tasks of the organization according to this Convention , in the individual determining how the procedures laid down in the Convention are to be applied .
the supplementary agreements can be expanded or amended without any changes to this Convention in the agreement between the organization and the Community .
the supplementary agreements enter into force at the same time or as soon as possible after the entry into force of the Convention . the Organization , the Community and the States shall endeav@@ our to enter into force within nin@@ ety days of the entry into force of the Convention ; an extension of this period requires the integration between the organization , the community and the states .
on the basis of the initial report mentioned in Article 62 , the organization provides a summari@@ zed inventory of the entire core material underlying the security measures in the States , irrespective of its origin , and carries out this inventory according to the subsequent reports and the results of its investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other hand
the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the international economic cooperation conference to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is hin@@ dered by general resource transfer problems .
C ) It is the aim of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the contribution made by Member States is bound within six months of the entry into force of the agreement and , as far as possible , is spent within two years of entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
D ) The E@@ EC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the middle bin@@ dings in order to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
to this end , the E@@ EC organization has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria specified in this agreement -
the organization establishes a special account under the name &quot; Special transaction &quot; which consists of the funds which the Member States contribute to the special transaction account ; this account is managed and used by the Organization as an administrator ( in this capacity the organization is referred to as &quot; car@@ et@@ aker &quot; ) , only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement .
the special transaction account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest @-@ bearing notes of the member state , which are to be paid in the currency of the relevant state to order of the organization as the car@@ et@@ aker of the special transaction account and to be deposited at the deposit of the organization in the country concerned .
B ) The payment shall be made in two install@@ ments , ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contract within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker at the agreed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at a different time agreed between the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker , taking into account the periods required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) E@@ ach Member State may , upon request , make payments to the above @-@ mentioned dates .
in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , the Administrator anticip@@ ates approximately proportion@@ ate drawing on the cash or the school notes in order to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and to balance the special transaction account in a reasonable manner .
in granting these loans , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the terms of the E@@ EC :
III ) the extent in which international economic factors contributed to the current and fores@@ eeable economic problems of the country ;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its additional capacity to loan to loan conditions without dis@@ agreement ; and
VII ) to the extent in which the problems of the countries concerned are governed by contributions from other sources .
any special transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly expanding development programme or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , irrespective of whether it belongs to the organization &apos;s loan programme or not , according to the procedures and practices which are to be considered , approved and managed by the ordinary funds of the organization , with which the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement must be taken into account .
the funds of the Special Sec@@ tions Account may not be used instead of ordinary funds of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which are bound to a program or project within the framework of a loan or loan , which has already been approved by the Bank &apos;s directors or the organization on the day of the entry into force .
apart from section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same re@@ payment terms , which are generally applicable to the organization granted by the organization ; thus , in ten years of free years , they are ref@@ und@@ able in 50 years .
special transactions are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts to pay this clock are to be paid directly to the organization that it reserves .
any special transaction loan is to be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the source of the funds is stated in particular .
the proceeds from any special transaction loan can be used for expendi@@ tures in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced or rendered ( i ) in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries which are members of the organization and which , according to what the administrator determined at the time the loan granted , could be recipients of a special transaction loan .
the capital re@@ payments of a special transaction are made to the special transaction account , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state shall be re@@ mitted as soon as possible from the car@@ et@@ aker to the member state in question .
until full payment of all special transaction loans , the car@@ et@@ aker teaches the E@@ EC on the plans and programs approved by the directors for the examination by the directors in preparation .
during the time of payment of the special transaction loan , the car@@ et@@ aker informs the E@@ EC quarterly on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses incurred for this .
the car@@ et@@ aker transm@@ its the E@@ EC as soon as possible after completion of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the special transaction account with a statement from the external audi@@ tors of the organization at this account completion .
after full payment of the special transaction loan , the car@@ et@@ aker of the E@@ EC con@@ veys a detailed report about the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account as soon as possible .
the car@@ et@@ aker creates and performs suitable records and invoices , from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts payable on the account and the amounts paid out of the account , and the re@@ payments to the Member States are apparent .
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker until the full issue of the special transaction account from time to time lead to an exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction account , the progress of programmes or projects financed by special transaction accounts and all other issues affecting the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement has not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , if necessary , the E@@ EC and the Organisation have not entered into force , the agreement and all the obligations of the parties resulting from it are due immediately .
if the total amount of the total amount of the special transaction loan granted by the recipients is rep@@ aid in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and transferred to the Member States , this agreement and all the obligations of the parties resulting from it are terminated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires the approval of the individual Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural rules of each party .
the governments of the Member States are noti@@ fying the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities the decision of the procedures concerned .
the General Secretary shall forward these noti@@ fications with a notification of the or@@ derly approval of this Agreement by the E@@ EC to the Organization .
this agreement will take effect and will enter into force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the named notes in the organization .
this agreement is written in two Ur@@ als in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , and each word is equally authentic .
whereas the agreement is to be concluded in the form of a letter to change the An@@ nex A of the protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) - HA@@ T issue :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics

&quot; &quot; &quot; and the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bundes@@ rat &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this program includes the preparation of a large test facility , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation are transferred to a common company according to chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty , herein@@ after called &quot; Shared Company J@@ ET . &quot;
for several years Switzerland has been dealing with research work in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics and is well acquainted with the area concerned .
since extensive work has to be carried out until practical use of controlled nuclear fusion , it is in the interests of the contracting parties of the present agreement to sum@@ mar@@ ise their respective efforts in order to avoid unnecessary overl@@ aps and to accelerate their respective research work , which has attained a higher priority level due to the energy crisis .
this agreement should enable any contracting party to take the greatest possible use of unnecessary overl@@ aps by combining their research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics , i.e. the common objective of this research , i.e. to achieve the cost @-@ moder@@ ately competitive electricity generation by using the controlled core fusion reaction .
to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes defined in An@@ nex I and II , herein@@ after referred to as Eur@@ atom Programme and the &quot; Swiss Program . &quot;
to ensure effective co @-@ operation , the Swiss programme takes over long @-@ term objectives and forms of cooperation between the Eur@@ atom programme ; it is extended or amended as amended by Articles 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present Convention to include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom programme .
each time the contracting parties accept a new program , this shall be replaced by the programs listed in App@@ endi@@ x I and II .
the association provided in paragraph 1 will be realised by : - adequate participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and implementation of the programs of the other party ;
- exchange of personnel among the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom @-@ Member States , in Switzerland and in the third countries with which Eur@@ atom concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; associated third countries , &quot; as well as the laboratories working on the Eur@@ atom programme ;
- mutual right to access the scientific and technical results of the respective programs .
within the scope of the target of the present agreement , Switzerland is involved in the J@@ ET project .
with regard to the implementation of the association envis@@ aged in Article 2 , 1 of this Agreement , the Parties concluded an association agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those between the Commission and the States and companies or individuals , herein@@ after referred to as Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s , with regard to the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program .
with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland is involved in the agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange between the Commission and the associated bodies , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Agreement on Person@@ nel Exchange . &quot;
in view of J@@ ET &apos;s participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of J@@ ET &apos;s Common Market , which it accepts .
Eur@@ atom also ensures that Switzerland can become the contractual partner of any contract , whose aim is within the framework of the present agreement , except association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity of the present agreement .
the bodies charged with the implementation of the Association envis@@ aged in Article 2 , Section 1 of the present Agreement shall be described in Article 5 to 10 of this Agreement and in the Association Agreement .
the Association Agreement , in particular , exclu@@ des the suspension of a steering committee , which is a member of the Commission and the Federal Council .
- to monitor and direct the development of research work to achieve the best possible results in accordance with the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland is represented in the following &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VG &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group used within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the VG , who has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters concerning the ongoing or planned programmes and activities within the Eur@@ atom programme , is responsible for all research and development activities relating to this agreement .
it promotes the co @-@ operation and coordination between the associated organs and direc@@ ts its T @-@ ness in the interests of both parties to the common objective specified in the Eur@@ atom program and in the Swiss programme , as well as to the common goal defined in Article 1 of the present Convention , whereby the scientific and technological developments in the world are du@@ ly taken into account .
pursuant to its Rules of Proced@@ ure , VG will appoint one or more Swiss representatives in the Advisory Group , created within the framework of the Eur@@ atom Programme , whenever the relevant Swiss authorities are concerned .
the advis@@ ors that submit the VG research proposals with regard to providing the best possible scientific results for the Eur@@ atom programme take this task into consideration for all research and development activities referred to in this agreement .
Switzerland is represented by the Director of one of the laboratories participating in the Eur@@ atom programme .

I honor you to confirm the consent of the Community to these changes , and suggest you as an appointment for entry into force 1 January 1978 .
I would be grateful if you confirmed the approval of your government to the foreg@@ o@@ ing .
I honor you to confirm the receipt of your present letter with the following wording :
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you confirm the approval of your government to the foreg@@ o@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on mobil@@ ising the demands of the Member States in the context of the medium @-@ term financial assistance
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ S could include Stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries when the banks submit a relevant application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the agreements could be concluded by the total amount of the contributions paid by the credi@@ tor to the mechanism , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion units of invoice ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery fund of the member countries .
however , some conditions are already mentioned below , for whose application the BI@@ S would be ready .
for each stand@@ by credit , the BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als without having to exceed a total of five years .
with the opening of the loans as well as in their event@@ ual extension , the BI@@ S would charge a credit expansion commission .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first draw will not be made before the end of a month following the conclusion of the Stand@@ by Agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the drawing would take place in the currencies available to the BI@@ S at the conclusion of the agreement , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods of time that were to be dealt with taking into account the Bank &apos;s funds , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those transactions which the BI@@ S applies at the time under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would correspond largely to the market rates .
if the BI@@ S has to proc@@ ure the necessary funds yourself on the market , the interest rate to be applied could reach a maximum which corresponds to the Li@@ bor of the corresponding margin .
I would be grateful if you would let me know the consent of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ S could include Stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries when the banks submit a relevant application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you gave me the consent of the Council of the European Communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine Republic on Trade with H@@ amm@@ el - und Lamm@@ ert
I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the Community . in the course of these negotiations , the two parties are agreed as follows :

the Committee discusses all questions arising in the implementation of this agreement and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this agreement shall apply without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the annual amount , which is set at number 2 , is valid for the period from January 1 to January 31 .

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples containing the an@@ tigen that is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or another substance indicated on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in a manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured on double in a suitable medium by repeated di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be examined .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated solely by volume of blood cell flow in the total volume .
for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents , which are to be used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has set up standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination of international norms , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity , standards are elabor@@ ated .
according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters that are observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination of most specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ tis , which is observed in a series of di@@ lution in er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation .
the ti@@ ter reveals the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the final mixture within a series where a micro@@ scopic ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , available for the International Standard preparations ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown re@@ agent in comparison with the International standard preparation or a state standard prepared in international units ( see Bul@@ letin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ eren contain 256 international units per ml .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Dental Laboratory of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of a comparative ti@@ tr@@ ation of the international standard anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2@@ B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties should be maintained for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in liquid form according to the label lies at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ iry date quoted on the label for dr@@ y@@ re@@ agents is based on the results of the durability tests ; it must be approved by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they are dried and which is thus closed so that no moisture can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent may lose a maximum of 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by further drying via phosph@@ or@@ us pent@@ oxi@@ des at a pressure of not more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours .
in order to prevent bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvents supplied with the des@@ ic@@ c@@ ents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to fulfill the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein nitrogen per ml of fluid or re @-@ dissolved serum .
the re@@ agents , whether in fluid form or after re@@ activation , must be transparent and must neither contain sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents for blood group determination which are determined for international exchange should not be colored arti@@ fici@@ ally as long as possible , at least until an international agreement has come about through a unified system .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent being in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity present in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all production stages and controls of re@@ agents for blood group determination .
appropriate samples of all re@@ agents given are to be kept from the laboratory until some probability can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
the re@@ agents used for blood group determination can contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective portion , the others are the necessary tools to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective part in three groups .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or vegetable re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin .
on each container is a black on white printed label in English and French which contains the following information : first name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the quantity or , with dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid needed for re@@ charge ,
in addition , this label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located or the instructions attached to the containers must contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,

furthermore , it is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the Anti @-@ B blood group serum or a corresponding contra@@ ction procedure against an in@@ undation of B blood cells .
the efficacy of the serum may in no case be less than 64 international units per ml .
the anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood serum that is un@@ dil@@ uted must also cause an easily identi@@ fiable ag@@ glut@@ ination of the blood cells of the A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ O ) blood cells .
if an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on an object carrier with equal amounts of 5@@ - to 10@@ % in@@ undation of A1 and A2 blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double period required when the same tests are performed with the re@@ dissolved but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the Anti @-@ A blood group serum or with a standard preparation of equal activity .

the following requirements for the efficacy of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h group may be changed when international standard preparations are available . i ) Anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is obtained from the blood of one or more people immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 32 compared to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9 % sal@@ ine solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an &quot; complete &quot; anti @-@ D serum is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ Rhine ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) serum or equivalent comparison of C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells .
in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , the serum should react with blood cells containing do @-@ Do @-@ an@@ tigen .
anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which are intended to be used by diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , must have visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ C serum is obtained from the blood of one or more people immun@@ ised by the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h @-@ system .
it re@@ acts with in@@ undation of human red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C an@@ tigen .
these Ser@@ a are therefore specific to the C an@@ tigen only when the tested blood cells are fl@@ ush@@ ed in a 0.@@ 9 % sal@@ ine solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ti@@ ter of the anti @-@ C serum ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 compared to c@@ c@@ d@@ dee @-@ blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the specific@@ ity of anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity of anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood of immun@@ ised individuals or can be produced by mixing anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum .
in a given serum , both antibodies must be effective at the same time under the reaction conditions specified by the manufacturer .
if a serum for use on object carriers is determined according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test , the ag@@ glut@@ ination time should not be lower in all types of red blood cells , which show a reaction , not less than with the proportion@@ ate antibodies .
anti @-@ A serum is obtained from the blood of animals that can be immun@@ ised by blood cells or specific substances of the group A .

the goods connected with the goods traffic between the parties shall be replaced by a single security officer to use the im@@ prints in accordance with the samples in An@@ nex I to this Convention .
depending on the case , the single paper serves as an application or paper for export , for shipping or for import .

- to be requested by the parties so that they may be eligible for the enjoyment of a part or a certain relief .
( 1 ) This Convention does not prevent the Parties to apply simplified procedures , even in the use of data processing , with regard to further facil@@ itation of the parties involved .
( 2 ) In particular , simplified procedures can be fores@@ een that the relevant goods are not to be placed at a customs office and the registration for these goods is not to be presented to the customs office ; furthermore , the submission of an incomplete registration may be permitted .
in these cases , a registration in which it can act with the consent of the competent authorities for a periodi@@ c collective registration must be submitted within the deadline established by these authorities .
in cases of paragraph 1 it is possible to use trade paper instead of a single api@@ ary .
if the single paper is used , the parties with the consent of the competent authorities may add to the list of common lists in which the goods are described .
- to conclude agreements or agreements with respect to further simpli@@ fication of the for@@ war@@ d@@ ment for all goods traffic or sub @-@ areas ;
- for con@@ sign@@ ments which include several types of goods , to use the goods in the shipping method of loading eli@@ sts instead of the supplementary sheets to the consistency paper ;
- to allow applications to be created without any form of public or private data processing plant according to the conditions laid down by the competent authorities ;
- to allow the competent authorities to enter the data required for the provision of the relevant form@@ alities in their data processing systems for the treatment of the applications , and , if necessary , without giving a written notification ;
- to allow the competent authorities in case of the use of a data processing system for the treatment of applications , that the export , shipping , or import alert is either caused by the security paper created by this system or , if such a paper is not prepared , by entering the data into the data processing plant ;
- To apply measures adopted by the Joint Committee in the way of a decision pursuant to Article 11 paragraph 3 .
( 1 ) The provisions governing the provision of goods necessary for the export , shipping and import of goods shall be laid down in App@@ endi@@ x II to this Convention .

however , without prejudi@@ ce to the special provisions of con@@ glomer@@ ates , the competent authorities may , however , fores@@ ee that the dispatch and shipping procedures shall be transferred to one and the same form by means of the copies intended for these purposes .
in the cases of Article 7 , the competent authorities are convinced , as far as possible , that the information contained in the copies of the application in the individual sections of the proceedings coinci@@ de .
( 1 ) To ensure a smooth transit of goods between the contracting parties and to facilitate the disclosure of ir@@ regul@@ arities or violations , the customs authorities of these countries shall seek one another or - if they consider it of interest to another contracting party - from itself out of all available information ( including administrative reports )
( 2 ) The administrative assistance may be denied or denied in whole or in part , if the desired country of view is that the administrative aid would viol@@ ate its security , public order ( &quot; or@@ dre public &quot; ) or other essential interests or viol@@ ate operating , business or professional sec@@ rec@@ y .
( 3 ) In the event of refusal or refusal of the minist@@ erial assistance , the appropriate decision and its grounds must be communicated without delay to the requ@@ esting state .
( 4 ) Does the customs authority of a country seek administrative assistance that it could not afford if it is sought , it indicates in its inquiry into this circum@@ stance .
( 5 ) The information obtained by paragraph 1 may only be used for the purposes of this Convention and shall enjoy the protection accor@@ ded to the national law of the country which it has received for information of this type .

the Parties to the DI@@ ES@@ ES Agreement , which have been worked out under the au@@ spices of the Council for Cooperation in the territory of the customs industry -
in DE@@ M W@@ UN@@ SCH to facilitate the acquisition , comparison and evaluation of statistical data , in particular those of international trade ,
in DE@@ M W@@ UN@@ SCH to reduce the costs resulting in the fact that goods in international trade transactions need to be re @-@ labeled , re @-@ filed and re @-@ enco@@ ded in the transition from a classification system to another , and to facilitate the standardi@@ zation of trading documents and the transmission of data ,
in THE weighing that the development of technology and structures of international trade were essential changes of the Brussels Convention of 15 December 1950 about the tari@@ ff scheme for the import of commodities into the tari@@ ff tari@@ ffs ,
furthermore , IN THE weighing that the measure of differentiation required by governments and the economy for tari@@ ff and statistical purposes is currently far beyond that which is contained in the system for the aforementioned agreement ,
in THE weighing that it is important to have accurate and comparable data in international trade negotiations ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; in THE &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weighing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the harmon@@ ised system is to be used for freight rates and traffic statistics of different kinds of transport , &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the weighing that the harmon@@ ised system is intended as far as possible to be included in the systems used in the trade for the designation and encoding of the goods ,
in THE weighing that the harmon@@ ised system will help to establish a close relationship between the import and export statistics on the one hand and the production statistics on the other hand , IN THE grant that a close relationship between the harmon@@ ised system and the International Product Directory for International Trade ( S@@ IT@@ C ) of the United Nations should be maintained ,
in THE weighing that it is desirable to comply with the above @-@ mentioned requirements by a combined tari@@ ff and statistical model , which is appropri@@ ated for use by international trade stakeholders ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the weighing that it is important to ensure the adaptation of the harmon@@ ized system to the development of technology and structures of international trade , &quot; &quot; &quot;
taking into account the work carried out by the Committee for Cooperation in the field of customs services , the Committee for the Harmon@@ ised System in this field ,
in THE weighing that - although the aforementioned agreement has proved to be an effective tool for the customs tari@@ ff scheme to achieve some of these goals - the conclusion of a new international convention is the most suitable way to achieve the desired result -
in the sense of this Convention a ) &quot; harmon@@ ized system for the designation and encoding of the goods , &quot; in the following &quot; harmon@@ ised system , &quot; consists of the positions and sub@@ positions with the corresponding code numbers , the notes on the sections . chapters and sub@@ positions as well as the general rules for the interpretation of the harmon@@ ised system ;

&quot; &quot; &quot; in THE &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weighing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that without a change in Article 13 of the mentioned Convention the time of entry into force of this convention would remain in@@ secure - &quot; &quot; &quot;
