<seg id="696">The purpose of the preventive measures laid down in this Convention is the timely detection of significant amounts of nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear waste bodies for unknown purposes as well as deterrence from such a detachment by the risk of early detection.</seg>
<seg id="697">To enrich the target set in Article 28, material accounting is used as a preventive measure of fundamental importance, associated with the spatial input and observation as important supplemental measures.</seg>
<seg id="698">The technical completion of the audits by the organisation is carried out by an explanation in which the quantity of material allocated for each material balance zone is specified for a specified period under specification of the accuracy limits for the specified megen.</seg>
<seg id="699">In carrying out their audits, the organization makes after article 3 full use of the security system of the community.</seg>
<seg id="700">The Accounting and Control System of the Community for Nuclear Material in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones.</seg>
<seg id="701">In the application of their security measures, the Community will make use of the methods and measures of the following kind and, as far as it is necessary, foresee how they are more closely determined and expedient in the supplementary agreements:</seg>

<seg id="723">C) Twenty metric tons of depleted uranium with an enrichment of 0.005 (0.5%) or less;</seg>
<seg id="724">Should the free nuclear material be processed, processed or stored together with nuclear materials that are subject to, processed or stored under the provisions of this Convention, precautions for the re-use of the security measures are taken on that material.</seg>
<seg id="725">The Community meets with the Organization of Supplementary agreements necessary to the extent that is necessary for the successful and effective provision of the tasks of the organization according to this Convention, in the individual determining how the procedures laid down in the Convention are to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="726">The supplementary agreements can be expanded or amended without any changes to this Convention in the agreement between the organization and the Community.</seg>
<seg id="727">The supplementary agreements enter into force at the same time or as soon as possible after the entry into force of the Convention. the Organization, the Community and the States shall endeavour to enter into force within ninety days of the entry into force of the Convention; an extension of this period requires the integration between the organization, the community and the states.</seg>
<seg id="728">On the basis of the initial report mentioned in Article 62, the organization provides a summarized inventory of the entire core material underlying the security measures in the States, irrespective of its origin, and carries out this inventory according to the subsequent reports and the results of its investigations.</seg>
<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States Belgium, Denmark, Federal Republic of Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation (Organisation) on the other hand</seg>
<seg id="730">The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the international economic cooperation conference to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income, whose development is hindered by general resource transfer problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) It is the aim of the EEC and the Member States that the contribution made by Member States is bound within six months of the entry into force of the agreement and, as far as possible, is spent within two years of entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">D) The EEC and the Organisation have consulted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the middle bindings in order to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">To this end, the EEC organization has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria specified in this agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">The organization establishes a special account under the name "Special transaction" which consists of the funds which the Member States contribute to the special transaction account; this account is managed and used by the Organization as an administrator (in this capacity the organization is referred to as "caretaker"), only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The special transaction account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions are to be paid as follows: a) Payment is made in the form of cash or non-interest-bearing notes of the member state, which are to be paid in the currency of the relevant state to order of the organization as the caretaker of the special transaction account and to be deposited at the deposit of the organization in the country concerned.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) The payment shall be made in two installments, (i) the first in the amount of at least 45 v. h. the contract within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the caretaker at the agreed time;</seg>
<seg id="738">II) the second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at a different time agreed between the EEC and the caretaker, taking into account the periods required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans.</seg>
<seg id="739">C) Each Member State may, upon request, make payments to the above-mentioned dates.</seg>
<seg id="740">In accordance with the usual procedures of the organization, the Administrator anticipates approximately proportionate drawing on the cash or the school notes in order to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and to balance the special transaction account in a reasonable manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">In granting these loans, the caretaker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the terms of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">III) the extent in which international economic factors contributed to the current and foreseeable economic problems of the country;</seg>
<seg id="743">VI) the composition and the tendency of the country's debt service and its additional capacity to loan to loan conditions without disagreement; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) to the extent in which the problems of the countries concerned are governed by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Any special transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly expanding development programme or project (including a sectoral project), irrespective of whether it belongs to the organization's loan programme or not, according to the procedures and practices which are to be considered, approved and managed by the ordinary funds of the organization, with which the preamble to this agreement must be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="746">The funds of the Special Sections Account may not be used instead of ordinary funds of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or the Organization, which are bound to a program or project within the framework of a loan or loan, which has already been approved by the Bank's directors or the organization on the day of the entry into force.</seg>
<seg id="747">Apart from section 4, special transaction loans are subject to the same repayment terms, which are generally applicable to the organization granted by the organization; thus, in ten years of free years, they are refundable in 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="748">Special transactions are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies.</seg>
<seg id="749">Amounts to pay this clock are to be paid directly to the organization that it reserves.</seg>
<seg id="750">Any special transaction loan is to be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator, in which the source of the funds is stated in particular.</seg>
<seg id="751">The proceeds from any special transaction loan can be used for expenditures in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced or rendered (i) in a Member State; ii) in developing countries which are members of the organization and which, according to what the administrator determined at the time the loan granted, could be recipients of a special transaction loan.</seg>
<seg id="752">The capital repayments of a special transaction are made to the special transaction account, and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state shall be remitted as soon as possible from the caretaker to the member state in question.</seg>
<seg id="753">Until full payment of all special transaction loans, the caretaker teaches the EEC on the plans and programs approved by the directors for the examination by the directors in preparation.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the time of payment of the special transaction loan, the caretaker informs the EEC quarterly on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses incurred for this.</seg>
<seg id="755">The caretaker transmits the EEC as soon as possible after completion of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the special transaction account with a statement from the external auditors of the organization at this account completion.</seg>
<seg id="756">After full payment of the special transaction loan, the caretaker of the EEC conveys a detailed report about the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="757">The caretaker creates and performs suitable records and invoices, from which the contributions to the special transaction account, the amounts payable on the account and the amounts paid out of the account, and the repayments to the Member States are apparent.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the caretaker work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">To this end, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the caretaker until the full issue of the special transaction account from time to time lead to an exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction account, the progress of programmes or projects financed by special transaction accounts and all other issues affecting the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="760">If this agreement has not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date, if necessary, the EEC and the Organisation have not entered into force, the agreement and all the obligations of the parties resulting from it are due immediately.</seg>
<seg id="761">If the total amount of the total amount of the special transaction loan granted by the recipients is repaid in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and transferred to the Member States, this agreement and all the obligations of the parties resulting from it are terminated with immediate effect.</seg>
<seg id="762">This agreement requires the approval of the individual Member States and the EEC in accordance with the procedural rules of each party.</seg>
<seg id="763">The governments of the Member States are notifying the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Communities the decision of the procedures concerned.</seg>
<seg id="764">The General Secretary shall forward these notifications with a notification of the orderly approval of this Agreement by the EEC to the Organization.</seg>
<seg id="765">This agreement will take effect and will enter into force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the named notes in the organization.</seg>
