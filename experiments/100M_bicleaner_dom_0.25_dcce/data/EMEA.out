this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee on Medi@@ c@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the conducted studies in order to get recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
if you need more information about your disease or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you would like further information regarding the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for taking in ( 1 mg / ml ) and as injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. Hum@@ ble thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental disorder where patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal con@@ spir@@ ation ) alter@@ nat@@ ely with periods of normal mood .
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the drug in the past .
the injection solution is used for fast control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , if the oral consumption of the medicine is not possible .
in both cases , the solution can be applied to take in or the processed tablets in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients who take other medicines at the same time , which are broken down as well as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the amount of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted .
this interfer@@ es with the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that facilitate the communication of nerve cells .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is thought primarily to be a &quot; partial ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole acts like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser extent than neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters work to activate the recept@@ ors .
as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing its recur@@ rence .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms has been studied in three studies of up to one year .
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases , which suffered from increased rest@@ lessness , over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence in 160 patients with which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabil@@ ised with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased rest@@ lessness , compared with Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in the patient &apos;s symptoms was investigated using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the enam@@ el tablets and the solution for taking in ( recording ) .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , showed a significantly greater reduction in symptoms than those who received placebo .
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , abili@@ fy decreased in four of five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo .
in addition , Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes up to 74 weeks more effectively than placebo in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses also reduced the symptoms more effectively than placebo and were similar to lau@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of abili@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( un@@ controlled sugar ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , nausea , vom@@ iting , nausea , vom@@ iting ( increased sali@@ va production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleeping disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who mainly had man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes responded to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole versus the risks .
moreover , the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in the fast control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if an oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd. for the transfer of abili@@ fy across the European Union .
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ ion disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
increased efficacy in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of abili@@ fy in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorders in patients ≥ 65 years of age has not been proven .
considering the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ duc@@ tor is released from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dosage ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after onset or after a change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results from an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions which pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ mia , treatment with blood @-@ lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including ac@@ ot@@ er@@ ated and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
if there are signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia in a patient treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy , it should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms indic@@ ative of a M@@ NS or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be disabled .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be applied with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or at states associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
however , there was in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response to un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events involving patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including Abi@@ li@@ fy .
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events associated with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents which allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ ite , poly@@ uria , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored regarding a deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , where weight gain is known as side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is required when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines with overl@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical study involving healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( poor &apos; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism the common application of high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
taking into account the joint gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , the potential benefit should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ or , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy to the can height should be raised to the dose height before beginning of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ u@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be administered with a moderate increase in the aria concentrations .
in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day showed no significant effect on the metabol@@ isms of the medi@@ ums of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ phi@@ c / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine @-@ R@@ atio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ phi@@ c ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
because of the insufficient data situation for safety in humans and due to the concerns raised in animal studies on animals , this drug may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned of using dangerous machinery , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ ón , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia emerged , compared with patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ ici@@ al therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ treatment .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term period of over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment was 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
elev@@ ations of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
the side effects that may occur in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy and about whose appearance has also been reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ ose attacks , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older demen@@ ti@@ as , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ intended or inten@@ tional acute over@@ doses with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death sequence .
there is no information about the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is unlikely that ha@@ em@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is useful in the treatment of over@@ dose because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma membrane connection .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity with dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4 , for ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and to hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1 receptor .
in the dose of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks on healthy subjects , posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent decrease in the binding of 11@@ C rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , on the nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the put@@ t .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 the proportion of respon@@ der patients adher@@ ing to study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current measurement scales , which were defined as secondary study targets including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger recovery than with Hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significant reduction in the rate of recur@@ rence in 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ ici@@ an @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia for 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study goal was &apos; weight gain &apos; , an increase of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a efficacy opposite placebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study of 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy opposite placebo .
in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a efficacy comparable to placebo in week 3 and a conservation effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
in addition , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a similar proportion of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia in week 12 such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which in part did not apply to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum concentrations , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l demonstrated superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l presented himself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the el@@ ong@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ k@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the average Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole for extensive metabol@@ is@@ itors over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours with poor &apos; poor &apos; metabol@@ isi@@ ans via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , and in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients there are no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a simulation @-@ specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not reveal any clin@@ ically significant differences regarding the eth@@ ni@@ city or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular danger to humans .
toxic@@ ological significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 to 10 times the middle Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the middle Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16 to 8 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found concentrations of the sulph@@ ate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l were not found at more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the G@@ all of monkeys , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro sol@@ ubil@@ ity .
in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 times the middle ste@@ ady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

15 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
22 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l presented himself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing abili@@ fy tablets can take the tablets alternatively to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorders have been reported in some cases after onset or after a change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .

generic Abi@@ li@@ fy Inj@@ ection Solution is used for fast control of det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
once clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment should be terminated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution and begin with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in order to increase res@@ or@@ ption and to minim@@ ise vari@@ ability , an injection is recommended in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle while circum@@ vent@@ ing obes@@ e regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) can be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines that have already been used for maintenance or ac@@ utely treatment ( see Section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy enam@@ el tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution .
there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution in patients with det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders caused by schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is deemed necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution , the patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or a blood pressure drop ( see Section 4.5 ) .
research on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l Inj@@ ection Solution is not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed or illegal ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions which pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ mia , treatment with blood @-@ lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including ac@@ ot@@ er@@ ated and malign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ ite , poly@@ uria , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored regarding a wor@@ sen@@ ing of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia because of com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , where weight gain is known as side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ dation was greater compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study where healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) was used as one @-@ time indication intra@@ muscul@@ arly and which simultaneously received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ muscul@@ arly .
105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( poor &apos; ) metabol@@ isations the common application of high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ or , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy to the can height should be raised to the dose height before beginning of the accompanying therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ muscul@@ arly received , the intensity of the se@@ dation was greater compared to that of the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .

107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as potential medi@@ cally relevant side @-@ effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see Section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment was 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term period of over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
elev@@ ations of CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ phosph@@ ate kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
side effects that may occur in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy and about whose appearance has also been reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ ose attacks , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older demen@@ ti@@ as , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant greater improvements of ag@@ gregation / behavi@@ our@@ al dysfunction compared with placebo and was similar to Hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms of ag@@ gregation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am reference arm .
the average improvement observed at the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end point was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9,@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ gregation , a similar efficacy was observed regarding the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined based on a reduced number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 the proportion of respon@@ der patients adher@@ ing to study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current measurement scales , which were defined as secondary study targets including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger recovery than with Hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a significantly greater reduction in the rate of recur@@ rence by 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ ici@@ an @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia for 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study goal was &apos; weight gain &apos; , a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which in part did not apply to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum concentrations , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l demonstrated superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week extension in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l presented himself superior to placebo in the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection was 90 % greater than the AU@@ C after the dose of the same dose as a tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy subjects , the average time until reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l Inj@@ ection Solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated use in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , the 15@@ - and 5 @-@ times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg in@@ tra @-@ muscle layers .
studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity following IV administration showed no safety @-@ related concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure , 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 @-@ mal ( rab@@ bits ) over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on the conventional studies using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular danger to humans .
toxic@@ ological significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; therefore , they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 to 10 times the middle steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a major study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters earlier had obtained an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in the sole dose or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medication containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other drugs for reducing the side effects ) .
in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to treatment compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
considering only those patients who were treated for the first time in metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference in efficacy indicators such as time to wor@@ sen@@ ing the disease and survival .
on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments from their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it may also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in their blood before the treatment begins .
the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) found that the treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el versus conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs and that in contrast to other medicines containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el it does not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited for the launch of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients whose first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is missing and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not shown ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ phi@@ c count &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the subsequent series .
in the case of sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy degrees 3 , treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached at grade 1 or 2 , and at all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustment in patients with mild to moderate liver function impairment ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies with patients with impaired ren@@ al function and there is currently no adequate data to recommend dose adjustment in patients with impairment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to inadequate data for safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el which could have much other pharmac@@ ological features than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be stopped immediately and symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment is initiated , and the patient may not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in the case of patients no renewed Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils rose again &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number is increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly associated cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity has not been proven , cardiac out@@ ages in the indicated patient group are not un@@ common , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if the patient has nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea following the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating means .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is essential .
women at child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ eption method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will be advised to not bear a child during and up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised of a sperm count prior to treatment because the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane means the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) which can affect the traffic and ability to operate machinery .
the following are the most common and major incidents of side @-@ effects that occurred in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma who were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most con@@ spic@@ uous important ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of the patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of the patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the dose of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : elevated blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :
dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , blo@@ ating , tongue burning , dry mouth , loose gum , loose stools , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , sor@@ es in the lower abdom@@ en , sor@@ es in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract :
pain in the chest body , weakness of muscles , neck pain , pain in the skel@@ etal muscul@@ ature , bac@@ on pain , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness Very common :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite in relation to a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual incidence are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events has been established .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules active in the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules and stabili@@ zes mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their de@@ poly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation results in an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in the framework of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in supports the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ sel@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ um@@ inal receptor and acts as a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the tumor due to the alb@@ um@@ at@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( secre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two random@@ ised studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised phase III comparative study .
in one study , 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion of over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used in 63 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma over 30 minutes .
this multi@@ center study was performed in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks , either in the form of a solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medication for preventing an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had previously received no chemotherapy , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for metast@@ asis and 19 % for metastatic disease and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the overall response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy are outlined below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity versus pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy degrees 3 at a time during the therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy for the decay of bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the exposure to active substance ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml , similar to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After the IV dose of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration decreased in multi@@ phase mode .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vas@@ cul@@ inary distribution and / or pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el distribution .
in a study involving patients with advanced solid tumours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after IV 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane were compared with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the clear@@ ance of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane injection ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher with Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed primarily to 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary ex@@ cre@@ tion of the unchanged active substance was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ite 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , indicating a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al Clear@@ ance .
however , only a few data are available to patients over the age of 75 , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was proved at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected from light light over 8 hours .

this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood vessels which might occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications , if a blood don@@ or is not possible prior to the procedure and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is displayed .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood donations , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein .
the injection can also be performed by the patient or his car@@ egi@@ ver , provided that they have received appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be checked before the treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy or in patients with kidney problems an an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by an er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ inal deficiency or by the fact that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced into which it enables epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa to be formed .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with the reference doctor in a major study involving 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems .
all participating patients had been inj@@ ected E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o for at least eight weeks before they were either stre@@ amed or continued to get E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the change in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study where the effects of stre@@ amed tra@@ se@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were studied in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values were maintained in the same measure as those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the bas@@ eline value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure that can occasionally cause symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , pier@@ cing mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion .
Un@@ se@@ amed should not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that it does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to the regulations of the European Union , evidence was provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that makes Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for the medical specialist in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted Medi@@ ce Medi@@ ce Medi@@ ce Medi@@ ce Medi@@ ce GmbH &amp; Co KG a permit for the launch of Ab@@ se@@ amed across the European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multiple my@@ el@@ oma , which receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general state ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ emia at the onset of chemotherapy ) .
the treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , with planned major surgical procedures requiring a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood in women ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
for the reduction of foreign blood Ab@@ se@@ amed can be applied in front of a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic intervention in adults with no iron deficiency , where high risk of fusion complications is expected .

the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ atric patients in which the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the physician &apos;s assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of illness is required .
an increase in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in patients or under the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration .
given this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be used to achieve the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to make sure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used at the lowest approved dose which is required to control an@@ emia and the symptoms of an@@ emia .
the clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance cans than patients with initial an@@ a@@ emia are less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.3 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance cans than patients with initial an@@ a@@ emia are less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week with intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ E. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms of an@@ emia and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , it is necessary to assess the individual clinical course and condition of the disease by the doctor .
given this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be used to achieve the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used at the lowest approved dose , which is necessary for control of the symptoms of the an@@ emia .
if after 4 weeks of treatment of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the redemption rate of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times per week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the redemption rate of &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l is increased compared to the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the redemption rate of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l is increased three times a week after another 4 weeks of treatment , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the redemption rate of &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , a response to epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be terminated .
patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood preserves is required , should be kept in a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks before surgery .
iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program started so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the se@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ E. / kg on each 10 consecutive days , on the day of the surgery and 4 days immediately thereafter .
alternatively , the injection at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis can be given via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to flush the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug into the circulation .
patients suffering from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) under the treatment with any er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin should not receive any se@@ amed or other er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ie ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month before treatment , inst@@ able ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) .
for patients who are intended for larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery and which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , cor@@ on@@ ary arter@@ ial disease , vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular accident .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ cy@@ sti@@ p@@ ie ( PR@@ C ) Very rarely was reported on the occurrence of an anti @-@ body medi@@ ated PR@@ CA according to mon@@ ate@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of action , defined as reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased demand for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the Re@@ ti@@ cul@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value should be determined and the common causes for non @-@ contact ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umin@@ umin@@ escence , infections or inflammation , blood loss and ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) are investigated .
if the Re@@ ti@@ cul@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ ti@@ cul@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes Index ) , is degra@@ ded ( &lt; 20.000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20.000 / milli@@ liter or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row should be considered to diagnose a PR@@ CA .
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk for an anti @-@ body @-@ induced PR@@ C ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 For patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration under Section 4.2 should not be exceeded .
in clinical trials , increased risk of disease and risk for severe cardiovascular events were observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ on @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit based on the gift of epo@@ e@@ tin if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required for control of the an@@ a@@ emia symptoms and the prevention of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of increased high blood pressure .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration under Section 4.2 should not be exceeded .
according to the present knowledge , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
in case of tumour patients under chemotherapy , a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ administration and er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response should be taken into account for the assessment of the therapeutic efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ( patients who may need to be trans@@ acted ) .
if the H@@ b increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see Section 4.2 Treatment of Pati@@ ents with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - dose adjustment with the aim of keeping the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the participation of the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are intended for larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated appropriately before the onset of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy .
patients undergoing larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive adequate prevention of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis because they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially with underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be ruled out that if treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an output value of &gt; 13 g / dl , there may be an increased risk of postoperative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events .
in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ins have not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7,5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose can be adjusted to the rising ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there are no indications of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F in hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
over th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , cereb@@ ral isch@@ emia , cereb@@ ral th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , retinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , retin@@ al@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin therapy , so also patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the wor@@ sen@@ ing of an existing hypertension .
increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients under treatment with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ines .
regardless of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin therapy , surgical patients with cardiovascular disease can cause th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications after repeated blood donations .
the technologi@@ cally recovered epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ sides and is identical to the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content with the endo@@ genous human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of native patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .
3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ o@@ stom@@ osis ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ oma , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ dg@@ kin lymph@@ omas and 24 other hem@@ o@@ stom@@ osis ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tumours ( 172 Mam@@ ma@@ c carcin@@ omas , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 22 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas , and 30 more ) .

survival and progression of tumour were studied in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the patient .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin showed an un@@ explained , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality rate compared to controls due to various common malign@@ ancies .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ oses and associated complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and at checks .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value under 13 g / dl as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the verified data .
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa determin@@ ations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy subjects and a slightly prolonged half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than serum levels , which are achieved after intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are appointed 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
bone mar@@ ital fibro@@ sis is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ tin fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
14 In animal experimental studies with approximately the 20@@ x of the recommended weekly dose , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa has led to decreased f@@ ec@@ tal body weight , a delay in the dose of Os@@ si@@ fication and an increase in fet@@ al mortality .
these reports are based on in vitro findings with cells of human tumor tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation .
as part of the out@@ patient application , the patient can store Ab@@ se@@ amed once for a maximum of 3 days outside the cooling case and not over 25 ° C .

the holder of the authorization for placing on the market has to supply the medical specialist in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmacy with the following information and materials before the market launch and in accordance with the agreement with the competent authorities of the member states : • Training brochure • summary of the characteristics of the drug ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging contribution .
the owner of the authorization for placing on the market has to make sure that the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system described in version 3.0 and installed in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the application is operational before the drug is brought into circulation and as long as the drug is applied in the traffic .
the holder of the authorization for placing on the market comm@@ its itself to implement the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan and additional measures for pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance , as described in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. according to each subsequent update of the Risk Management Plan .
according to the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use , &quot; an updated R@@ MP should be provided simultaneously with the next updated report on the safety of the drug ( Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) .
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • upon receipt of new information that may affect the current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or the risk reduction measures • within 60 days of reaching an important ( pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance or risk reduction ) mil@@ estones
• In a month before your treatment , you have suffered a heart attack or stroke • if you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time occ@@ uring or increased chest pain ) • the risk of ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge in the veins ( deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ) occurs - for example , if you have previously played such a blood test
you suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial disease ) , the cervi@@ cal vessels ( vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) , you have recently suffered a heart attack or stroke .
during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , there can be a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets within the normal range , which re@@ covers in further treatment .
your doctor will carry out regular blood checks if necessary to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
lack of iron , dis@@ solving red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be taken into account and treated with Ab@@ se@@ amed before starting therapy .
very rare was reported on the occurrence of an anti @-@ body @-@ medi@@ ated er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ ia after months to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
if you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a , it will deter your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated because of an an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value could be the risk of problems with the heart or the blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
with increased or increasing potassium levels , your doctor may consider an interruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels are in the normal range again .
if you suffer from chronic kidney disease and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion signs by insufficient heart performance , your doctor will ensure that your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in level does not exceed a certain value .
according to the present knowledge , the treatment of blood poverty with Ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ administration and desired effect should be considered for ass@@ essing the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your se@@ amed dose accordingly to keep the risk of blood cl@@ ots ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( obes@@ e ) or if there have been th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events in the past ( e.g. deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis or pulmon@@ ary em@@ bol@@ ism ) .
if you are cancer patients , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed is like a growth factor for blood cells , and under certain circumstances the tumor may adver@@ sely affect the tumor .
if you have a larger orthop@@ edic surgery , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be studied and treated appropriately before the start of treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed .
if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of blood cl@@ apping after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have / or recently used / used other medicines , even if it is not a prescription medicine .
if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( agent to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your session with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may prescri@@ be certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are a means of building up the immune system , e.g. in cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ a@@ emia responds to treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of your treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well tuned , you get regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice weekly , distributed over two equally large inj@@ ections .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of your treatment and ensure that your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how the an@@ a@@ emia responds to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to ensure this and ensure that the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the doctor treating the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in will carry out regular blood checks .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on day of surgery and another 4 days after surgery .
however , if your doctor holds this for appropriate , you can also learn how to spray Ab@@ se@@ amed himself under the skin .
heart , heart attack , cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , stroke , temporary circul@@ atory disorders of the brain , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , thro@@ mb@@ oses of the retina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients under er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment .

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including those who have recently suffered a small trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture as in the case of h@@ inf@@ estation ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ tures should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle before the first in@@ fusion .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce the symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
as the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material was used for the evaluation of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in the first study , almost 8 000 older women with oste@@ opor@@ osis were involved , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who had recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was studied over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies on a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ er@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase content in serum ( an enzyme that breaks bone substance ) norm@@ alized in the blood or decreased at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis drug ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to placebo .
compared to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis medicine ) with those under placebo the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ tures 9 % of the patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ la@@ sta must not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to cy@@ ol@@ ei@@ c acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , Pati@@ ents with Ac@@ la@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ to@@ sis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta manufacturer provides educational material for physicians to prescri@@ be the Ac@@ la@@ sta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis which contains information on how to use the medicine , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited to appro@@ ve the transport of Ac@@ la@@ sta across the European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • P@@ acking supplement • Con@@ tra@@ ine@@ ation in pregnancy and in breast@@ feeding women • Re@@ quired for adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing aid
treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year .
in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ tures the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of hip frac@@ tures ( see section 5.1 ) .
for treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the Pa@@ get treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta a long re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to provide sufficient calcium intake of calcium for at least 10 days after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
in patients with a recently developed low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ alem or intra@@ muscular Vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced shortly after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen following the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with kidney function disorder ( see Section 4.4 ) For patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended as limited clinical experience for this patient population is available .
elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) are not necessary because bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination are similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents Ac@@ la@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age , since data for safety and effectiveness are missing .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , as only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia must be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before starting treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.3 ) .
because of the rapid insertion of the effect of cit@@ ric acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , occasionally symp@@ tom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia may develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to provide sufficient calcium intake of calcium for at least 10 days after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get ( see Section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene should be considered to be a dental check@@ up with appropriate preventive dental treatment prior to use of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
no data is available for patients who need dental interventions , whether the interruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ tomy in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced shortly after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( see Section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation reported as severe side effects was increased by patients who received Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug interactions are listed in table 1 .
kidney function disorder was associated with ren@@ al dysfunction , which was associated with decrease in the ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in the serum cre@@ atine ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in cre@@ atine @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured annually prior to administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a restricted ren@@ al function were comparable in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the placebo @-@ group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ atine in 10 days after administration was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta versus 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the transi@@ ent asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium levels , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.6 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , were 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the disease @-@ pa@@ get studies .
all patients received supple@@ mental doses of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after hip frac@@ tures and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently developed hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical trial was reported on local reactions at the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ tomy in the max@@ il@@ lo@@ facial region has been treated , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervention .
7 Pati@@ ents with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients performed oste@@ on@@ ec@@ tomy in the jaw area of one with Ac@@ la@@ sta and in a patients treated with placebo .
in the case of over@@ dose , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a balance can be achieved by the addition of oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years has been indicated with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ S@@ core for the fem@@ oral neck ≤ -@@ 1.5 and at least two mild or moderate @-@ heavy existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures or a BM@@ D @-@ T @-@ S@@ core for the fem@@ oral neck ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ ra frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric fluid bodies Ac@@ la@@ sta decreased significantly over a period of three years as well as the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures after one year ( see table 2 ) .
aged 75 years and older , Ac@@ la@@ sta treated patients with a 60 % lower risk of verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta showed a consistent effect over three years , reduced by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) and reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased bone density at the lum@@ bar verteb@@ rate , hip , and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase of bone density in the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.3 % , the she@@ ar @-@ neck by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology At 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , bone biop@@ si@@ es from the basin were taken one year after the third annual dose .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ P ) analysis showed an increase of the tra@@ be@@ cular bone volume and the preservation of the tra@@ be@@ cular bone architecture .
bone replacement markers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of the type @-@ ion col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in periods of study duration .
after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 mg dosage Ac@@ la@@ sta reduced significantly by 30 % compared to bas@@ eline and was held at 28 % below the bas@@ eline level to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the bas@@ eline value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the bas@@ eline after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the bas@@ eline value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment increased in comparison to placebo @-@ treatment the BM@@ D at the total and Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als at all time points .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment led to a 5.@@ 4 % increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % compared to placebo and 4.3 % on the lower shelf .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in men treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 8.@@ 7 % compared to placebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once weekly administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta was not inferior compared to the once weekly dose of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate relative to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra @-@ BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical effectiveness of the treatment with the disease of the bone Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta has been studied in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically proven , especially light to moder@@ ately severe disease Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2.5 @-@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg co@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of Ris@@ er@@ ron@@ at once daily for 2 months was demonstrated in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the bas@@ eline for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ er@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month main study could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 patients treated with Ris@@ er@@ ron@@ at and 107 patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response was maintained at 141 of the patients treated with Ris@@ er@@ ron@@ at , compared to 71 patients treated with Ris@@ er@@ ron@@ at , after 18 months follow @-@ up .
one @-@ off and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg co@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent .
after that , the plasma indicator rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life times t ½ alpha 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β 1,@@ 87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination period t ½ g 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above and ½ -@@ values ) presumably represent the rapid absorption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion through the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue .
the total body @-@ Clear@@ ance amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h , irrespective of the dose and remains unaffected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion @-@ time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron @-@ acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface below the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a reduced clear@@ ance of met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed substances by cy@@ to@@ chrome @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely because c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see Section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ atine @-@ Clear@@ ance , and in the 64 examined patients in mean 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al dysfunction until a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min does not require a dose adjustment of the Z@@ ol@@ ei@@ ronic acid .
as for severe ren@@ al dysfunction ( cre@@ atine @-@ clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are available , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ let@@ al intraven@@ ous single dose amounted to 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and rats 0,@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
for trials on dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C 6 times of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) were administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence .
chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In trials of intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of Z@@ ol@@ ei@@ ron@@ xy@@ lic acid in rats was administered by taking doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to the 7@@ x of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated exposure to accumulated ex@@ positions that exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects occurred in other organs including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as at the intraven@@ ous injection site .
the most frequent findings in trials with repeated use was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the Met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ res@@ or@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
rats observed a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages of 0.2 mg / kg as outer and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of low serum calcium levels .

according to the CH@@ MP Directive for Risk Management Systems for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known that could affect the current statements on safety , pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or activities to minim@@ ise the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days when an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) was reached . • On request of the E@@ MEA .
Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid is a substance class that is called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the bone Pa@@ get of the bone .
declining blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens that are made of and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
in the Pa@@ get , bone reconstruction is too fast , and new bone material is built up un@@ ordered , which makes bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ la@@ sta works by norm@@ alizing the bone reconstruction in order to ensure normal bone formation , thereby restoring strength to the bone .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
if you use Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have been taken / used recently , even if it is not prescription medicine .
for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking medicines that are known to be harmful to the kidneys .
if you use Ac@@ la@@ sta together with food and drink , please be aware that you will have enough fluids according to your doctor &apos;s instructions before and after the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein .
if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to take the administration of acet@@ one for two or more weeks following the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein .
as acet@@ one works for a long time , you may need another dose only after one year or more .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low during the time after in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can work for more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment .
if the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta has been missed , please contact your doctor or hospital to arrange a new appointment .
before the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta If you consider the completion of treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss it with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion frequently occur ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but less frequent after subsequent in@@ fusion .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
at present it is not clear if Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you have received Ac@@ la@@ sta .
physical signs of a too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps or ting@@ ling or num@@ b feeling , especially in the area around the mouth .

persistent pain and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or jaw were reported primarily in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates because of other diseases .
about allergic reactions , including rare cases of breathing problems , n@@ ett@@ le rash and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , was reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or the nursing staff if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not listed in this use information .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions right up to the application ; normally , 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .
in patients with a recently developed low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , it is recommended to perform the in@@ fusion of acet@@ one for two or more weeks following the operative care of hip frac@@ tures .
before and after the administration of acet@@ ate , the patients must be adequately supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
because of the rapid intervention of the effect of cit@@ ric acid on bone reconstruction , temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ emia may develop , the maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in addition , it is highly advisable to provide sufficient calcium intake of calcium for at least 10 days after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
in patients with a recently developed low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ alem or intra@@ muscular Vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .

A@@ comp@@ lia is used in addition to a diet and exercise for adult patients who suffer from obesity ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² ( BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and in addition one or more I
in addition , four studies were conducted in over 7@@ ,000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive agent compared to placebo .
the studies on the setting of smoking showed no uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess in this field of application .
what risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? it &apos;s most common side effects reported by A@@ comp@@ lia that were observed during studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and upper respiratory tract infections .
it may also not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or be treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it may increase the risk of depression and , among other things , can give rise to a small minority of patients su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts .
caution is advisable when using A@@ comp@@ lia with drugs such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( drugs against fung@@ al infections ) , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for use in HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , T@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .

the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that A@@ comp@@ lia &apos;s efficacy in reducing weight in patients with obesity or overweight
medicines used in patients who need it for health reasons and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing clari@@ fication packages for patients and physicians ) , and around the ar@@ z
in addition to diet and exercise for the treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which also have one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 due to lack of data on efficacy and safety .
depres@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported at up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts of up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used for depres@@ sive disorders , unless the benefits of treatment in an individual case out@@ weigh the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
it is also possible for patients who - in addition to obesity - have no recognis@@ able risks , may result in depres@@ sive reactions .
relatives or other close persons are advised that it is necessary to monitor the occurrence of such symptoms and immediately seek medical advice if these symptoms arise . l@@ n
• Ol@@ der patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown sufficiently .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) less than 6 months ago were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .

in some , but not in all cases , the onset of conv@@ ul@@ sions seems to be associated with stress @-@ related stress such as dealing with animals .
if Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the mat@@ ing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , no adverse effects were observed on the fertility or menstru@@ al disturbances .
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was examined at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , an exposition with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and lac@@ tation caused no changes in learning behavior or memory .

summary of the EP@@ AR to the public This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee on Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the conducted studies in order to get recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . it can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medicine ) is not shown .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) , met@@ form@@ in alone cannot be sufficiently adjusted in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin , the present dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the acet@@ ate treatment except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin is reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level drops , making type 2 diabetes more effective .
in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of acet@@ ate was studied in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
this led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were reduced in the application of dos@@ ages of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of an additional dose of acet@@ ate for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ate showed a 0.@@ 94 % reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c , while the additional dose of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study in which the combination of acet@@ ate and insulin was examined in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients receiving ac@@ tos in addition to insulin had a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % to 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who took placebo .
the most common adverse events associated with Ac@@ tos were vision disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections , weight gain and hypo@@ the@@ ti@@ y ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may react hyper@@ sensitive to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - acid levels - in blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients with met@@ form@@ in as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in .
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to appro@@ ve the placing of an account in the entire European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry the lab@@ eling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on one side and the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other side . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and is in@@ appropriate for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
for application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are endangered by the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually .
patients should be seen in signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in heart failure reports , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with elevated liver enzyme values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that point to h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , Ober@@ bau@@ ch@@ discomfort , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme values must be examined .
the decision , whether the treatment of the patient with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one continues , should be directed to the prec@@ ursor of the laboratory parameters from the clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent increase in weight has been proven , which can be caused by fatty deposits and in some cases linked to fluid retention .
as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a slight reduction of middle hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on .
similar changes were observed in comparison controlled studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3.6 @-@ 4.1 % ) and to a lesser extent also in patients under sul@@ fon@@ y@@ har@@ n@@ ate and insulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia is the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia in patients who receive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral two @-@ fold or triple @-@ combination therapy with insulin .
after the market launch it was reported under treatment with thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ a , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , an occurrence or wor@@ sen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a decrease in visual acuity .
it is not clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the appearance of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients report on disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be taken into account .
in a summary analysis of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the examination of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patients years ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one were treated , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes to be pregnant or who occurs , the treatment is to be dep@@ rec@@ ated ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on the interactions have shown that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not exercise any relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with drugs met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chro@@ mium P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C from pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chro@@ mium P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction in AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ insulin @-@ induced hyper@@ insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal are reduced , thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for the fet@@ al growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , individual cases : unknown ( cannot be estimated in this data ) .
these lead to a temporary alteration of the Tur@@ g@@ or and the refrac@@ tive index of the lens as seen in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T asc@@ ents exceeded the three times the upper limit of the normal range , similar to placebo , but less frequently than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ y@@ har@@ n@@ ate .
in an outcome study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease , the incidence of severe cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher compared to placebo if pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
since the market launch it has rarely been reported about heart failure under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , but more often when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has been used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients were treated in groups treated with comparative medicine .
in the Pro@@ Active study conducted over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one were treated , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days , followed by 180 mg / day for seven days , no symptoms occurred .
pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one appears to work on activation of specific nucle@@ i recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ation activated rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) , which in the animal model leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be shown that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose classification in the event of an insulin resistance .
a clinical trial with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus g@@ lic@@ la@@ din as mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time to post the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time of two years after the beginning of the therapy , a blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) was maintained by pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ din ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was inadequate with insulin for three months were random@@ ized to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to patients receiving insulin . a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ as compared to bas@@ eline values .
the effect of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diabe@@ tics .
in most clinical trials , compared to placebo , a reduction in overall plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol as well as margin@@ ally , but clin@@ ically not significantly elevated L@@ DL@@ - cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the total plasma gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol levels compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or g@@ lic@@ la@@ din .
in contrast to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol was found under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , while fewer values were observed under met@@ form@@ in and g@@ lic@@ la@@ din .
in a 20 week study pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels but also improved the post@@ erior increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , this both through an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 5@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ized into groups who received either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to the already existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular treatment .
according to oral application , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is quickly absorbed , whereby the peak concentrations of un@@ modified pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma are normally reached 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to efficacy is approximately three times the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal .
interaction studies have shown that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chro@@ mium P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chro@@ mium P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see Section 4.5 ) .
after oral use of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in decay ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in urine ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma phase of an imm@@ utable pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active metabol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral clearance are similar .
in toxic@@ ology studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume aug@@ mentation with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ insulin @-@ induced hyper@@ insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal are reduced , thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for the fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder epitheli@@ um were induced .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ a led to increased frequency of col@@ onic tum@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry the lab@@ eling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on one side and the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other side . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the examination of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patients years ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one were treated , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
in another study more than two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or g@@ lic@@ la@@ zide have been studied .
in clinical trials over 1 year , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ratio compared to bas@@ eline values .
in a 20 week study pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced fun@@ dus tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post@@ erior increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , this both through an effect on tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ d synthesis .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane became a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ pe@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c level , indicating that the blood sugar levels were lowered to a similar degree as with another human@@ insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human@@ insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted if administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the package insert ) .
the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane were out@@ weighed in the treatment of diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ pe@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily if a quick initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar level has improved , for example , by intensified insulin therapy , can perceive hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change in strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human@@ insulin or insulin analog ) and / or method of production ( through re@@ combin@@ ant DNA compared to insulin in animal origin ) may cause a change in dosage .
if a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different than in their previous insulin .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such trips can lead to insulin and meals being used or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions during the therapy and always ask his patients for other medicines taken by them .

hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia may , however , develop gradually : • Light@@ weight hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias can be treated with the oral intake of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias involving un@@ consciousness are treated with an in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or by glucose which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total effectiveness is up to 24 hours .
absorption The res@@ or@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with faster or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of fis@@ sion ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human @-@ insulin molecule were taken into consideration ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split is active .

the active ingredient in Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , insulin @-@ human ( r@@ DNA ) , is produced using the method of the so @-@ called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant technology &quot; :
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 86 68 E @-@ mail : mail @ eme@@ a.@@ europ@@ a.@@ eu ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ europ@@ a.@@ eu
Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id must not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin @-@ human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the entire European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin which is quickly acting must first be raised , followed by the amount of insulin that is long acting .
3 If a dose adjustment is required when changing to ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such trips can lead to insulin and meals being used or taken at other times .
5 General diseases and complaints at the administration site - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions at the injection site Dur@@ ing insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma at the injection site ) may occur .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias involving un@@ consciousness are treated with an in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or by glucose which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients who underwent major surgical procedures has shown that an intraven@@ ous ( blood sugar 4.4 - 6.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) reduced mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs. 4.6 % ) .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the overall length of action is about 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data are limited , but suggest that the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .
in@@ fusion systems with acet@@ tra@@ p@@ id in concentrations 0.@@ 05 I.@@ U. / ml - 1,0 I.@@ E. / ml Insul@@ in human in in@@ fusion fluids 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de , 5 % D @-@ glucose and 10 % D@@ - glucose with 40 m@@ mo@@ l / l potassium chlori@@ de are stable at room temperature for 24 hours at room temperature .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients with signs of de@@ position , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or g@@ out no@@ des ( &quot; stones , &quot; i.e. larger pri@@ mor@@ dial deposits which may lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid levels still lie more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first months of treatment , g@@ out attacks can still occur , which is why it is recommended that patients with aden@@ ur@@ ic treatment continue to use other medicines for preventing g@@ out attacks during the first six months of treatment .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had organ transplantation as it was not studied for these groups .
in the first study involving 1 0@@ 72 patients the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the placebo ( pseu@@ do @-@ medication ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another drug for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared with al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol for a year in 7@@ 62 patients .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was administered at a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who took Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of 80 mg once a day and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of the patients receiving 120 mg once a day , had a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in no of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver enzymes .
especially in patients with heart problems in pre@@ history there may be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in reducing the ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but could also contain a higher risk of side effects related to heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to pri@@ mor@@ dial deposits ( including one of the medical records known or currently available and / or arthritis ) .
if the serum concentration level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x can be taken daily .
in patients with severe kidney function , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated until now ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
since there is no experience in children and adolescents , the use of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended .
organ transplan@@ t recipients since there is no experience in organ transplan@@ t recipients , the use of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or degenerative heart failure treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other urine @-@ acid medicines , acute rheum@@ atism can occur during the course of treatment , because ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissue can be mobil@@ ised at first by lowering the serum resin level .
B. for malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases is so far that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract .
disorders of liver function in patients treated with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at were observed during Phase 3 clinical trials ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before beginning of the F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ or and in the further course depending on clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine Z@@ was did not have any interaction studies on F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to a rise in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ lin@@ spi@@ egels ( an in@@ hibition of the metabol@@ isation of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
subjects were associated with simultaneous dose of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / war@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adjustment for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient used at the same time .
in a study with subjects , 120 m@@ g. of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily had an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 medium , suggest@@ ing a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vivo .
ant@@ ar@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of a ant@@ acid which contains magnesium hydro@@ xide and aluminum hydro@@ xide , slow@@ s down the absorption of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) and causes a decrease in C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant changes in the AU@@ C .
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies can not be related to side effects of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal experimental studies do not include direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful in controlling a vehicle , operating machines or performing hazardous activities until they can reasonably be sure that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the overall f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s compared to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patients years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects that could be in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which were reported more than once in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups , are listed below .
diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical studies no severe r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
7 Off@@ ene long @-@ term extension studies in the open long @-@ term extension studies have been treated 9@@ 06 patients up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients treated with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
adverse events reported during the long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported more than once in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups and occurred in patients who received F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to information occasionally .

the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three month specific serum concentration levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with a serum incre@@ ment value at the beginning of study &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in both treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with traditionally used doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in both treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with the traditionally used dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the reduction of serum urine acid levels to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and maintained throughout the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum incre@@ ments &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,0 mg / dl were given 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( ie . ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of serum concentrations in subjects , irrespective of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum di@@ ac@@ ic acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of the patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had at the beginning of study ( bas@@ eline ) a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in two years from the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of serum eye acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of g@@ out attack ( i.e. more than 3 % of the patients needed no treatment against g@@ entry ) in the months 16 @-@ 24 .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the g@@ out node , which resulted in 54 % of patients incomplete fusion of the g@@ out no@@ des by month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ A values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ l / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients receiving Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the plasma concentration time @-@ curve ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 m@@ g. dos@@ ed propor@@ tionally .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is larger than the dose proportional increase .
after intake of simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to approximately 2.8 @-@ 3,@@ 2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage decrease of serum concentration was observed if this was checked ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent steady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at plasma protein binding is approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding of alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ s showed that these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are predominantly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ure glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id originates mainly through U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as an unchanged F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ cos@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 30 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion via urine , approximately 45 % of the dose was found in the chair as an unchanged F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ cos@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 1 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
special patient groups kidney failure After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ MA@@ x of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change compared to subjects with normal kidney function .
the mean total AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at around 1.8 times of 7.5 μ g / ml in the group with normal kidney function increased to 13.@@ 2 μ g / ml in the group with severe kidney termination function .
12 Li@@ ver dysfunction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ Pu@@ gh classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh classification B ) Li@@ ver dysfunction changed the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes with regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects observed .
carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impairment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase in ur@@ inary bladder tumours ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed treated group , approximately 11 times the exposure of men .
these findings are considered as a result of a specific pur@@ in@@ abo@@ li@@ zation and urine composition and considered not relevant to the clinical application .
it has been found that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on the fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
at high doses , which were at about 4.3 times the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was observed , accompanied by a reduction in breeding performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the offspring of rats .
ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions , roughly 4,@@ 3 times as well as tra@@ pping rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions which were about 13 times the human therapeutic exposure , did not result in ter@@ ato@@ genic effects .

21 Open long @-@ term extension studies in the open long @-@ term extension studies have been treated 9@@ 06 patients up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients treated with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three month specific serum concentration levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the data collected in two years from the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of serum eye acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of g@@ out attack ( i.e. more than 3 % of the patients needed no treatment against g@@ entry ) in the months 16 @-@ 24 .

in some people , ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that ur@@ ic acid becomes in@@ soluble .
if you keep the ur@@ ic acid concentration low through the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the crystal formation is prevented and in this way a reduction of the discomfort is achieved .
AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC must not be taken if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredient F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or any of the other components of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC .
tell your doctor before you start taking this drug if you have a heart weakness or suffer from any other heart problem . • If you suffer from a high ur@@ ic acid concentration as a result of a cancer or Les@@ ch @-@ Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ( a rare con@@ genital disease where too much ur@@ ic acid is found in the blood ) .
if you have a po@@ ison@@ ous attack at the moment ( sudden appearance of severe pain , pressure sensitivity , redness , warmth and joint swelling ) , wait until the rheum@@ atic attack is cleared before you start treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC .
this does not have to be the case with everyone , but could also occur with you , especially during the first weeks of treatment or - months , if you take AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC .
your doctor will prescri@@ be other medicines if necessary to prevent a g@@ out attack or to treat the symptoms associated with it ( such as pain and joint swelling ) .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have / or recently used / used other medicines , even if it is not a prescription medicine .
it is particularly important that you inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking medicines that are one of the following substances , since interactions with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC may occur and your doctor may want to consider necessary measures . • Mer@@ cap@@ top@@ ur@@ in ( for the treatment of immune defence ) • The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine ( for the treatment of asthma ) • War@@ far@@ in ( for blood th@@ inning in heart disease )
no studies on the effects of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC on transport capability and the ability to operate machinery were carried out .
therefore , please consult with your doctor after consultation with your doctor if you are aware that you suffer from intoler@@ ance to certain sugar@@ s .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease where bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irritation of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient may not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at and Vitamin D@@ 3 are already being used separately in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union , the company presented data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to the increase in vitamin D levels .
after a 15 week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in the patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) compared to those who received only Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data suggest@@ ing that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose included in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( digestive disorders ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( digestive disorders ) , ul@@ cers ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gy ( bac@@ kl@@ ash ) , irrit@@ ated abdom@@ en ( b@@ lower abdom@@ en ) as well as aci@@ dic re@@ occurring .
in patients with possible hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other ingredients , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be applied .
it may not be used for o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us disease , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low levels of calcium ) or in patients who cannot sit or sit for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ a Ltd. to appro@@ ve the placing of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the entire European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other side . &quot; &quot; &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and associated side @-@ effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal ble@@ ed@@ ings or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract ( see section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al nar@@ rations , were reported in patients under the ing@@ es@@ tion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partially these severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that point to possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be advised to susp@@ end the medicine in case of symptoms of malign@@ ant irritation , such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ star pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe ocular side effects may be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or continue to take it after the occurrence of symptoms that point to an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was found , gastro@@ intestinal and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cers , some severe and complications were reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ tomy of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapeutic regi@@ ment contains predominantly intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there is no data available to indicate whether the use of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who require a surgical procedure decreases the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning in each patient on the basis of an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed to take the pill the next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after they have noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet a week as originally planned at the scheduled week@@ day .
other diseases affecting mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated before starting therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if taken at the same time .
therefore , after taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , the patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials along with a large number of commonly prescribed drugs without any clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not to be applied during pregnancy or breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate leave no indication of directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports were reported by cancer patients , but also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis .
nevertheless , the reduction of serum calcium up to &lt; 8.@@ 0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in both treatment groups with a similar frequency .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at In@@ sight of an oral over@@ dose may occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .
Col@@ ec@@ al@@ ci@@ fer@@ ol ( vitamin D@@ 3 ) vitamin D@@ 3 is produced in the skin by UV light over the transformation of 7 @-@ Deh@@ y@@ dro@@ ol to vitamin D@@ 3 .
the main effect of 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D@@ 3 is to increase the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosph@@ ate as well as the regulation of serum calcium , ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone res@@ or@@ ption .
in severe cases , a lack of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , weakness of the proxim@@ al muscul@@ ature and oste@@ om@@ al@@ ac@@ ia can lead to a further increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures in oste@@ opor@@ otic individuals .

patients received AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in lower strength ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) ( n = 350 ) or F@@ os@@ am@@ ax ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ) 70 mg once a week ( n = 3@@ 32 ) ; other vitamin D supplements were prohibited .
after 15 weeks of treatment , the average serum levels of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D were significantly higher ( 26 % ) in the group under AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) ( 56 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 23 ng / ml &#93; ) as in the group under Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at alone ( 46 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 18,@@ 2 ng / ml &#93; ) .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) significantly reduced the proportion of patients with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency ( serum value of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ pro@@ D &lt; 37@@ ,5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 ng / ml &#93; ) by 6@@ 2.5 % compared to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 12 % vs ) .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate &apos;s therapeutic equi@@ val@@ ence once weekly 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg daily ( n = 370 ) was demonstrated in a one @-@ year multi @-@ center study in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
the effects of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two Phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in phase III trials , the average asc@@ ents of BM@@ D with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate amounted to 8.@@ 8 % compared to placebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % on the fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % on the trough .
in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , a 48 % reduction in the placebo group ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 3.2 % compared to placebo was 6.2 % ) in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies the asc@@ ents of BM@@ D from spine and tro@@ mb@@ one continued ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the whole body was maintained .
fit consisted of two pla@@ z@@ ebo@@ controlled studies , in which Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily furthermore either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily dose of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the appearance of at least one new ed@@ dy frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 7.@@ 9 % compared to placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
res@@ or@@ ption of an intraven@@ ous dose was 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after noc@@ tur@@ nal fast and two hours before taking a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to approximately 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drinking of the day .
in healthy subjects , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) did not lead to any clin@@ ically important alteration of the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies in rats show that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is distributed in Wei@@ cht@@ eil@@ tails after intraven@@ ous dose of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly re@@ distributed into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine .
after IV administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , about 50 % of the radioactive substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the fa@@ ec@@ es .
following the intraven@@ ous dose of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was 71 ml / min and the systemic Clear@@ ance exceeded 200 ml / min .
in rats , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines by these transport systems .
absorption In healthy adult subjects ( women and men ) after night fasting and two hours before taking a meal the medi@@ an area under the serum concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 120 h ) for vitamin D@@ 3 29@@ 6.@@ 4 ng · h / ml ( excluding endo@@ genous vitamin D@@ 3 levels ) .
the average maximum concentration in serum ( C@@ MA@@ x ) of vitamin D@@ 3 was 5.@@ 9 ng / ml and the medi@@ an time up to the maximum serum concentration ( T@@ max ) of 12 hours .
in the liver , biot@@ ran@@ s@@ formation vitamin D@@ 3 is quickly hydro@@ xy@@ lit@@ te in the liver and is met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in the kidney to 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D@@ 3 , the bi@@ ologically active form .
ex@@ cre@@ tion In the case of radio@@ actively marked vitamin D@@ 3 in healthy subjects , the average ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours was 2.4 % , in the decay after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % .
characteristics in patients with prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not deposited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via urine .
although there are no clinical data on this , it is still expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as well as in animal studies will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
therefore , in patients with reduced kidney function , a slightly increased accumulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate can be expected in the bone ( see Section 4.2 ) .

Adv@@ agra@@ f is administered adult patients with a kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent rejection of the transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and pro@@ gra@@ ft / pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company presented results from previous studies with pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ t , using Adv@@ agra@@ f using Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rep@@ elled after one year ( for example by examining how often a new organ transplan@@ t or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , shorter further studies were carried out on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ t and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t and examined how Adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

in patients with possible hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other components , Adv@@ agra@@ f may not be applied .
patients and physicians must be cau@@ tious when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines are taken simultaneously with Adv@@ agra@@ f , as the Adv@@ ant@@ ine dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adapted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or hyper@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes in the formulation or regime should only be performed under close scrut@@ iny of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of a switch to an alternative formulation , therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and appropriate dose adjustment must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of re@@ pul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood @-@ level regulations ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus wall mirrors should be controlled before the change@@ over and over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a tal@@ low , was comparable to both ni@@ otic and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated inspections of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus wall mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate transplan@@ t phase .
because tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a low @-@ Clear@@ ance substance , an adaptation of the Adv@@ ance Dos@@ age scheme may take several days before the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the condition of the patient does not allow oral consumption of drugs during the first postoperative period , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be initiated intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate to produce an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of the application For suppression of gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression has to be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t prevention of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ ance therapy should start at 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning .
further dosage adjustments may be necessary later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of the patient &apos;s stabil@@ isation after the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ ance therapy should start at 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning .
dosage recommendations - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f M@@ ust be converted from twice daily dose of Pro@@ gra@@ f Cap@@ sul@@ es to a once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ f , this conversion has to take place in proportion 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose .
after a change from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Adv@@ agra@@ f once a day , the treatment with the recommended oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ ts must begin with the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
heart transplan@@ t In adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ agra@@ f , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken once daily in the morning .
other transplan@@ t recipients , although there is no clinical experience with Adv@@ agra@@ f in lung , pancre@@ atic and intest@@ ine transplan@@ ted patients , came to an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day in treatment @-@ transplan@@ ted patients at an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adjustments in special patient groups Pati@@ ents with reduced liver function In order to maintain blood levels in the targeted area , a reduction of the dose may be necessary in patients with severe liver function disorders .
patients with reduced kidney function Sin@@ ce the kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , a careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the serum incre@@ ment levels , a calculation of the cre@@ atine @-@ ins and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
switching from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy , caution is required ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of re@@ pul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in the individual case with the use of whole blood Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ low @-@ mirrors .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus wall mirror during the first two weeks after transplantation , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ tal@@ low levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be checked after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , dose adaptation , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or simultaneous use of substances that could alter the blood concentration of the blood ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a drug with a low clearance , adjustment of the dose may take several days until the Ste@@ ady State has occurred .
clinical studies indicate that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood level in the blood does not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the whole blood are usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and kidney - and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t receivers , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used .
this has led to serious adverse events including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects caused by tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus sub@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes in the formulation or regime should only be performed under close scrut@@ iny of any physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be therap@@ ist@@ ed against other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f .
no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f is available for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and gra@@ ft recipients in childhood .
due to possible interactions which may lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus hormone in the blood and weak@@ ening the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other plant remedies during treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f should be avoided ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is required , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels may be subject to considerable variations in such circumstances .
in rare cases a beta @-@ hyper@@ tro@@ phy referred to as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was observed , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ agra@@ ph .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the possible risk of malign@@ ant skin les@@ ions due to appropriate clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor .
if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus have symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , changed states of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and blur@@ red vision , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f Hart@@ ble@@ capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded , lac@@ tose are included in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary lac@@ t@@ sis intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ mal@@ absorption , special caution is required .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies , known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can influence the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and consequently increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ blood @-@ level with simultaneous addition of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dosage to maintain uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strong interaction with anti@@ fung@@ al drugs such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ media antibiotic er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z )
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels results mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with drugs met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can interfere with their metabolism .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus can increase the exposure to hormon@@ al exposure , decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures should be particularly cau@@ tious .
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus potentially reduces the clear@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and may pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of tests on transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that under tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a new@@ born hyper@@ kal@@ emia ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants can often not be determined precisely because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a large number of other medicines .
in the following , the side effects are listed in decreasing order : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , not known ( frequency on the basis of the available data ) .

infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases As known in other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants are often raised in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , proto@@ zo@@ ale ) frequently .
cases of BK @-@ Virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy , including therapy with Adv@@ agra@@ f .
it was reported on ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tumours in combination with treatment with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
due to its high molecular weight , low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and high binding of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins , Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can not be di@@ aly@@ zed .
the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be medi@@ ated through its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ isches protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cellular inn@@ aker .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents tran@@ scription of a specific set of lymph@@ oma genes .

overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies correspon@@ ded to observations in the large studies where pro@@ gra@@ f was used in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
in an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multi@@ centre study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f , more than 110 patients were reported who received either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ isation .
chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of ob@@ liter@@ ate syndrome , was observed less frequently after transplantation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) in the first year after transplantation .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in 2@@ 1,7 % of cases in the development of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis the ob@@ liter@@ ans were compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 0.@@ 02 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who have been converted from Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was higher after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the treatment @-@ transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis in ob@@ liter@@ ans@@ - syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
a multi@@ centre study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was performed to 205 patients undergoing pancre@@ atic and kidney transplantation , which received a random@@ ised Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) procedure .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to achieve the desired level of tal@@ low from 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
color@@ ec@@ tal transplantation The published clinical results of a mono@@ centric clinical trial with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after color@@ ec@@ tal transplan@@ tations showed an up @-@ to @-@ date survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t and low concentrations of protein that lead to an increase in the un@@ bound fraction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of the metabolism caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher clear@@ ances observed after the transplan@@ t .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed prior to ex@@ cre@@ tion , and ex@@ cre@@ tion is mainly done via bile .
the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ agra@@ f was approximately 10 % lower compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f for stable patients ( once a day ) in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) related to the total daily dose .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus wall mirror during the first two weeks after transplantation , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .

Adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder caused by the deficiency of Factor VI@@ II ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether it is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor of VI@@ II deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or inner organs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but is produced according to a method called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced into which it enables the formation of the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II .
Adv@@ ate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently , so that the drug does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years of age , the use of the drug was examined for the prevention of ble@@ ed@@ ings and surgical procedures .
in the main study , the efficacy of Adv@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood sep@@ episodes with &quot; excellent &quot; and &quot; good &quot; was evaluated .
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VI@@ II .
it may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or Ham@@ ster@@ oid or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG for placing Adv@@ ate on the whole of the European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , on the location and the extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor VI@@ II activity in the appropriate period should not fall below the indicated plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk for the patient is over .
during the course of treatment the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections to be administered and the frequency of inj@@ ections are recommended .
individual patients may differ in their response to factor VI@@ II , different in vivo recovery and have different half @-@ value times .
3 Pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activities are not achieved or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed to detect an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ory values , it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures need to be considered .
the rate of administration should be based on the patient &apos;s condition , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min not exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always directed against the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by means of modified Be@@ thes@@ da as@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to factor VI@@ II , while the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an am@@ n@@ estic known inhibit@@ or development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II @-@ product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( low @-@ tri@@ gen ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A in women there are no experiences concerning the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s used in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors of Factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all with previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of inhibit@@ ing inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected waste of the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ ke occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - levels in the plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance Rate showed sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in 145 children and adults , 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) showed only one patient after 26 exposure days with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
in addition , in none of the 53 pedi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed with severe to moderate H@@ äm@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or was detected after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) .
in previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical study , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) treated patients treated with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were inhibit@@ ors of factor VI@@ II .
the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contam@@ in@@ ating proteins was analysed by investigating the antibody ti@@ ters against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend and a persistent peak of the anti @-@ CH@@ O @-@ cell protein level , but otherwise no signs or symptoms indicated an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients isolated cases of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions in the study .
7 As with other IV products , A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E reports about hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the activated factor VI@@ II acts as a factor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X of factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were performed at pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( base value of factor VI@@ II @-@ activity ≤ 2 % ) .

based on the data available since the first admission , the CH@@ MP has further evaluated the benefits risk assessment , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E security profile , which necess@@ it@@ ates a filing of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder shall apply for further extension procedures in 5 years .
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited announced the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the Company res@@ ig@@ ns its application for approval of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissues which connect , surround and support other structures in the body ) are affected .
it is a kind of virus that has been genetically engineered to be able to carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has been modified in such a way that there are no copies of themselves and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
adv@@ ex@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors , enabling the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
the p@@ 53 protein produced from the p@@ 53 gene that is not defective in the human body normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and killing the cells when DNA cannot be restored .
in the case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide .
the company presented data from a study involving a patient with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of the under@@ belly , in the bones and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP has checked the answers of the company to the questions he asked , some questions were still unclear .
based on the review of the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP builds a list of questions sent to the company on day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore benefits for patients .
the committee also had concerns regarding the treatment of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that it is not harmful to the environment or for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not inform the CH@@ MP if the withdrawal will have consequences for patients who are currently taking part in clinical studies or &quot; com@@ only use &quot; programmes with adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed drug release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , inflammation of the nas@@ al path@@ ways caused by allergy to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cous swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents 12 years of age , the recommended dose of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet , which should be taken with or without food in a glass of water .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ ung .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy measures were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the ha@@ y@@ fever symptoms reported by the patient before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
when considering all the hay fever symptoms other than the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients receiving aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients showed a reduction of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who had lost breast cancer alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ ase ) , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( other medicines for treating allergies ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also not be applied to patients who suffer from narrow @-@ angle glaucoma ( elevated intra@@ ocular pressure ) , heart disease or vascular disease including hypertension ( high blood pressure ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ phy ) or ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke ( stroke ) or a risk of ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for placing Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but can be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking it , breaking or ch@@ ewing ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years of age due to lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application should be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have stopped .
it is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days , as long @-@ term use may decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
after the reduction of the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued as a mon@@ otherapy when required .
since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within 2 weeks following completion of such therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , gan@@ y@@ dro@@ g@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a that are per@@ oral or nas@@ al as swelling of r@@ hin@@ ology ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , Nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy have not been tested for this patient group and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze have not been tested in patients with kidney or liver function disorder and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients need to be informed that the treatment in case of hypertension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or of pal@@ pit@@ ations , ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or headache ) must be reli@@ eved .
patients with hypertension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ ton@@ ia • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bli@@ ster ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is to be dep@@ rec@@ ated at least 48 hours before der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka otherwise can prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions .
in the course of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole was administered in addition , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in plasma concentrations of the patients were observed .
in the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor tests , no significant differences could be found between the patients treated with placebo and the patients treated with placebo , regardless of whether or not des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other drugs cannot be completely ruled out .
in vivo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 does not inhi@@ bit des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , and in vitro studies have shown that the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 drug is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the harm@@ lessness of the application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not guaranteed , but experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , did not result in an increase in the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency in the normal population .
as reproductive studies on animals cannot always be transmitted to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied during pregnancy .
however , the patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may come to a stup@@ or which may result in an impairment of the transport capability or the ability to operate machinery .
the symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S @-@ depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible Latvian courses .
headache , anxiety , ag@@ grav@@ ating mic@@ tion , muscular weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , breathing in@@ suffici@@ ency , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , preventive pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , blur@@ red vision , hypertension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony .
CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ drying , pup@@ il star@@ re and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ s as well as in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ sel@@ ector on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study with adults , des@@ ul@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. daily did not detect an increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ tom@@ im@@ etic effects such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of CN@@ S arous@@ al .
1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients between the ages of 12 and 78 took part in the seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher compared to mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined on the basis of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aerobic tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city affili@@ ation .
in the course of a single dose study for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of dosing in plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of a@@ ero @-@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow equilibrium of lost veins , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
in the course of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study carried out with the formulation as a tablet on healthy adult subjects , it was found that four test subjects were poorly metabol@@ ised .
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the exclusive application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine is equivalent to exposure to an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on the conventional studies of safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , gene toxic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not reveal any particular danger to humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in oral doses of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day was not ter@@ ato@@ genic .
March 2007 and pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system described in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application for authorisation is and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the relief of the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose and tear@@ ing or it@@ ching eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating the nose .
20 Only in certain circumstances , you may be particularly sensitive to the mu@@ cos@@ a of wa@@ sting medicines called pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , which is included in this medicine .
( diabetes ) , a sten@@ o@@ ving ga@@ stri@@ c ul@@ cer ( ul@@ cer that leads to nar@@ rowing of stomach , small intest@@ ine or es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ) , a bladder neck closure , bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the medical history ( short@@ ness of breath due to a var@@ ic@@ ose of the pulmon@@ ary muscles ) , a prostate enlargement or problems with the liver , kidneys or bladder .
tell your doctor if you experience or diagnose the following symptoms or illnesses under the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • High blood pressure • Heart ch@@ ase , pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythm disorders • nausea and head@@ aches , or intensi@@ fication of existing head@@ aches .
if you are taking Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not a prescription medicine .
transport and operation of machinery When used in the recommended dosage , it is not to be expected that aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze leads to di@@ zz@@ iness or reduces the attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should immediately inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
if you miss taking Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze if you forgot to take a dose in time , take the dose as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this use information .
heart ch@@ ase , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , mouth @-@ drying , di@@ zz@@ iness , sore throat , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , sugar in urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , fatigue , headache , sleep disorders , nerv@@ ousness , and di@@ zz@@ iness .

after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , very rarely has been reported on cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin rash .
cases of heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ ase , stomach pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , over cases of liver inflammation and cases of con@@ spic@@ uous liver failure were also very rare reported .
it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate for taking ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml and 5 mg melt tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1,@@ 25 mg once a day , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup .
for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies of patients who had asthma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by identifying the symptoms ( it@@ ching , the number and size of the quad@@ ric@@ ots , impairment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been submitted to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to take in and the processed tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us showed an average decrease in symptom scores by 25 to 32 % compared to a decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving placebo .
in both studies in Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in symptom scores was 58 and 67 % after six weeks of treatment , compared to 40 and 33 % compared to placebo @-@ treated patients .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for placing A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
one tablet once daily , with or without a meal , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in young people aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( onset of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the current illness and can be terminated following the end of the symptoms and can be resum@@ ed at their re@@ occurring .
in case of persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( onset of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) , a prolonged treatment may be recommended to patients during the time of allergy .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , the patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may come to light that may result in a distur@@ b@@ ance of the transport capability or the ability to operate machinery .
in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us daily at the recommended dose of 5 mg versus patients treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , mouth dry ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
a clinical trial with 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients aged 12 to 17 was the most frequent side effect of head@@ aches , which was diagnosed in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study involving up to 45 mg of des@@ ul@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times a clinical dose ) .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ s as well as in@@ hibition of the adhesion of the adhesion molecules P @-@ sel@@ ector to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses that were administered at a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which chl@@ oram@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily ( twice the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears , and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may be classified depending on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the onset of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the onset of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as demonstrated by the overall survival of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , irrespective of e@@ ti@@ ology , is similar to the different forms and chronic patients can be easily recru@@ ited pro@@ spec@@ tively .
since the history of hist@@ am@@ ines is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ aria diseases , it is expected that in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n will also lead to an improvement in symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of no@@ d@@ les at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the majority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka were excluded from the study .
an improvement of the it@@ ching rate by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and al@@ ert@@ ness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients had a higher concentration of lost patients .
there is no indication of clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily use of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabol@@ isms of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so interactions with other medicines are not completely ruled out .
in @-@ vivo Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 drug is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dosage of 7.5 mg meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not detect any particular danger to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and there is no data available to support an infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examination and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between the ages of 2 and 11 have been metabol@@ ised to the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experienced higher endurance ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children from 2 to 11 years , which is more restricted , is identical to that of children that met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze normal .
this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ I@@ som@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials using A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children aged between 2 and 11 was similar to the placebo group in the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in different indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose reported 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than those treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study involving adult and adol@@ escent patients with up to 45 mg of des@@ ul@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times a clinical dose ) .
children between the ages of 1 and 11 who were eligible for anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy received a daily total dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( between 1 and 5 years old ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of orph@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of orph@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
in the course of a clinical trial with multiple doses of adults and adolescents in which chl@@ oram@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used for 14 days in a dose of up to 20 mg , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study involving adults and adolescents in which patients were administered at a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , there was no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents showed no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents showed no impairment of the psych@@ om@@ otor function in clinical trials .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies on adults , alcohol @-@ induced loss of performance neither increased drow@@ sin@@ ess nor increased drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears , and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as demonstrated by the overall survival of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the effects caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of no@@ d@@ les at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this restric@@ ting met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between the ages of 2 and 11 with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which can be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
the strain ( AU@@ C ) caused by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was approximately 6@@ times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of approximately 120 hours .
there is no indication of clin@@ ically relevant active substance cum@@ ulation after once daily use of chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In different single dose studies , the AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients were comparable with the recommended doses with those of adults who received a 5 mg dose of chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other drugs cannot be completely ruled out .
A@@ eri@@ us Si@@ rup is available in type III bra@@ cing bottles with child@@ proof polypropylene cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

take a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at once a day to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
immediately before use , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ ath must be taken for taking , without damaging it .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials using A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
for clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets daily compared to those treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study involving up to 45 mg of des@@ ul@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times a clinical dose ) .
A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated in two single @-@ dose studies ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses that have been used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which chl@@ oram@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily ( twice the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. daily did not detect an increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
in a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears , and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .

use two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets once a day to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in young people aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately before use , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the enam@@ el tablet should be removed without damaging it .
efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets in children under 6 years of age have not been proven .
the overall frequency of the side @-@ effects between the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and placebo group was equal and did not differ significantly from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us melted tablet proved to be a bio@@ equivalent of the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate for the formulation of lost adi@@ ene .

in single dose crossover trials of A@@ eri@@ us Mel@@ ting tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate , form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not examined in pedi@@ atric patients , but in connection with the dose @-@ finding @-@ studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years .

the overall frequency of adverse events in children between the ages of 2 and 11 was similar to that of the placebo group .
in infants between 6 and 23 months , the most common side effects reported more frequently than placebo were diar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2.3 % ) .
in an additional study , no side effects were observed in patients between 6 and 11 years of age at a single dose of 2.5 mg of des@@ ul@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
at the recommended doses the plasma concentrations of the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population .

if the solution for accepting an application sy@@ ringe for preparations to take with sc@@ aling is added , you can use it alternatively to take the appropriate amount of solution for taking .
regarding the duration of treatment your doctor will determine the type of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s you are suffering from and will determine how long you should take A@@ eri@@ us solution for taking .
however , in children under 2 years of diar@@ rhe@@ a , fever and in@@ som@@ nia , frequent side effects were reported more often than with placebo in adults &apos; fatigue , mouth dri@@ veness , and headache .
97 A@@ eri@@ us solution for intake is available in bottles with child safe closure cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .
the 150 ml packaging size is a measuring spoon or an application sy@@ ringe f@@ û@@ r preparations for accepting with sc@@ aling of 2.5 ml and 5 ml cans .
in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. acknowledged the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the Company res@@ ig@@ ns its application for the introduction of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov on the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influ@@ enza caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic occurs when a new trunk of the flu virus occurs , which can easily spread from man to person , because humans have not built up immunity ( no protection ) .
once the vaccine is administered , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the influ@@ enza virus contained in the vaccine as &quot; foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
this makes the immune system later able to form antibodies faster in contact with a flu virus .
subsequently , the membrane shell of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognis@@ es as foreign ) , was puri@@ fied and used as a constitu@@ ent of the vaccine .
an inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for ass@@ essing the safety of the vaccine was insufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you are taking part in a clinical trial and require further information on your treatment , please contact your attending physician .
if you would like further information regarding the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution , but this cannot be taken together with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the safety of this combination has not been studied .
as@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed when the doctor has checked which anti@@ viral drug the patient has previously taken , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood of the virus to respond to the drug .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which is taken together with twice daily 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
for children between the ages of 4 and 12 and for patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of ag@@ gregation according to body weight is directed .
when used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase decreases the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level .
not to cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage to the immune system and hence the development of AIDS @-@ related infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the drug , with low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who previously took prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in the viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml compared to placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but only very few responded to the treatment by the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
in the trial with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the viral load reinforced with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r lowered the viral load as effectively as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors after 16 weeks of treatment :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gener@@ ase came together with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r for a more severe drop in the viral load after four weeks compared to the patients receiving their former prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ val@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
as@@ gener@@ ase may also not be applied to patients who take St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines which are degra@@ ded just like A@@ gener@@ ase and are health @-@ damaging in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take ag@@ gregation are the risk of a lip@@ id ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of ag@@ gregation in use in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children out@@ weigh the risks over four years .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic reinfor@@ cer Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee found that the benefit of ag@@ gregation in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally admitted under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited for the transport of ag@@ gregation in the entire European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be administered for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sters of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should be performed taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , aspir@@ in capsules and solution to intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not re@@ plac@@ eable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ val@@ ase capsules is 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses of ag@@ gregation ( 1200 mg twice a day ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for aspir@@ in capsules is 20 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of ag@@ gregation in combination with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see paragraph 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be carried out in patients with mild or moderate liver function disorder with caution ; in patients with severe liver function disorder , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
as@@ gener@@ ase must not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and can also display substrates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ is@@ other@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver side effects with potentially fatal disease .
for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant specialist information of these medicines .
patients with pre @-@ existing reduced liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased incidence of liver function disorders under anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that are metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ush@@ ing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , simultaneous administration of ast@@ atin with lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
in patients taking this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase may be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
because of the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , but the information is insufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ pen@@ di@@ ment symptoms , especially if low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be administered .
because of the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ co@@ ence of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this dosage form is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups .
as@@ gener@@ ase should be set to 5 in duration if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases in which drugs were necessary to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B . higher age , and associated with drug dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis are reported .
at the time of initi@@ ating anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , HIV @-@ infected patients may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections that lead to severe clinical conditions or wor@@ sen@@ ing symptoms .
although multi@@ fac@@ torial e@@ ti@@ ology is assumed ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ tomy were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV @-@ disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ medi@@ ums with inferior therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with drugs that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ is@@ other@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ medi@@ ums with inferior therapeutic width ag@@ gregation with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be given together with medicines whose active ingredients are metabol@@ ised primarily by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with increased plasma levels with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
in the attempt to compensate the degra@@ ded plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse events were often observed in the liver .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus level and , if possible , check the viral load and dep@@ ose the St. John &apos;s wort .
dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not necessary when nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is given together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % increased , compared to C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were applied twice daily and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment plan .
52 % lower if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily in combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but strict monitoring is recommended , as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , but due to the in@@ ventive component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine it is recommended that the revenues of di@@ dan@@ o@@ in and as@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see the ant@@ acid below ) .
therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) there is no dose adjustment required .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
the effect of ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine may lower the serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if these medicines should be used at the same time , caution is advised , as Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
if these medicines are used together , caution is required ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made , as precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to a rise in plasma concentrations ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in a rise in side @-@ effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with as@@ er@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in the C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to the 2,@@ 69@@ ple compared to the value that was observed once daily with k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole without simultaneous application of F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below including medi@@ ums , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can potentially interact when applied together with ag@@ gregation .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with ag@@ gregation .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as ag@@ gregation , as it may cause res@@ or@@ ption faults .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ s@@ ants known as enzyme induc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , can lead to a decrease in the plasma concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ eli@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by 10 am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these medicines .
the simultaneous intake of A@@ val@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and intensi@@ fy with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study where Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of test subjects , the Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid@@ al effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
for H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases in plasma levels can be expected while administration of A@@ gener@@ ase .
since plasma level increases of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including a rh@@ ub@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations until stabil@@ ising the mirror is recommended , as the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with simultaneous injection of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , as@@ gener@@ ase should not be applied along with Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am taken or@@ ally ( see section 4.3 ) while with simultaneous use of ag@@ gregation with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
data for the simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors point to a possible increase in plasma gas of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ pi@@ ate symptoms , especially if low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be administered .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation of how to adjust the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus dosage , if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with simultaneous administration of War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended due to the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening of the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are also recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended in the simultaneous administration of ag@@ gregation ( see section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may be used during pregnancy only after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected in the milk of lac@@ tation @-@ related rats , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk in humans .
a reproduction study of gravi@@ d rats , which was administered from the in@@ hibition in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight during lac@@ tation .
the further development of offspring , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
the safety of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , occurred early and rarely led to the treatment interruption .
many of these events are not clari@@ fied if they are related to the use of A@@ gener@@ ase or any other medicine used for HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects listed below are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg of A@@ val@@ ase twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , evaluated by investig@@ ators as in connection with study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as laboratory changes occurring in the course of treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and fat sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased in@@ tra @-@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cervi@@ cal fat accumulation ( stem cells ) .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated persons treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ u@@ dine / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ dine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( stem cells ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 with 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients under am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ cu@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be canc@@ eled .
cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ tomy were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV @-@ disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
at the time of initi@@ ating anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , HIV @-@ infected patients may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ val@@ ase twice a day along with low dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were similar to those observed under general ag@@ gregation treatment ( Grade 3 and 4 ) , which occurred in patients who received ap@@ hor@@ ase along with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to be observed on signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thus prevents the processing of viral g@@ ag@@ - and ga@@ g @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ prot@@ ein@@ stages with the consequence of a formation of un@@ ripe , non @-@ infectious viral particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB has been studied both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % hem@@ m@@ RNA concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is located in the range between 0.0@@ 12 and 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in the case of ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in the case of chron@@ ically infected cells .
the connection between the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r versus HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral , non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved end@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dosage , the mut@@ ations described in other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r were rarely observed with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors .
in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral , non @-@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg of F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates gen@@ otyp@@ ically studied .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ate of 13 out of 14 children in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults .

gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance test @-@ based analysis of gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or f@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ then@@ ol @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / G , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with an increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance on f@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as well as a reduced probability of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always approach the current interpretation systems for analy@@ sing the results of resistance tests .
based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in combination with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or f@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ under @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that market diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic samples generates a certain degree of resistance against rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data on resistance between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance path@@ ways , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral and non @-@ treated patients ( one of which demonstrated resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ) and another against ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three from 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
on the other hand , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early departure of a failing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study involving PI pre@@ treated adults following vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ side alo@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and sixty ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI have been included in the sub@@ study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis showed the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of AP@@ V / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ le@@ aking shaft of 0,@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ ble@@ ached ag@@ gregation is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of whom 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking and capsules in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg was tested three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks approximately 25 % of the patients enrolled in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the bas@@ eline .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 B@@ ased on this data , the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ag@@ gregation should be considered in therapy optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) amounts to the maximum Ser@@ um concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50 % increased , by contrast , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained unaffected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and leaves a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood circulation into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which represents the active part remains probably unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates throughout the dosing interval depending on the total drug concentrations in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , respectively represent a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrate , must be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if given simultaneously with ag@@ gregation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , results in a similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is less bio@@ available from the solution than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
the ren@@ al clear@@ ance of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction may be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schemes lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those obtained in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas occurred in male animals in dos@@ ages , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8 @-@ fold ( rat ) of the exposure to humans , after twice daily administration of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , there was little evidence for the adoption of clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and from the therapeutic application .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes contained , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in the clinical everyday life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has been observed in clinical trials , neither during administration of aspir@@ in nor after the end of the treatment .
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
in case of systemic plasma exposure , which was significant under ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to a therapeutic dose in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus @-@ ong@@ ation and minor changes of skel@@ etal changes were observed , indicating a delayed development .
24 If A@@ val@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are applied without the addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses of ag@@ gregation ( 1200 mg twice a day ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for aspir@@ in capsules is 20 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be carried out with caution in patients with mild or mild liver function disorder , in patients with severe liver function disorder , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
as@@ gener@@ ase should be reli@@ eved in the duration 27 when a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and drug dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increased , compared to C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily in combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but strict monitoring is recommended , as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
if these medicines are used together , caution is required ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made , as precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose is recommended , although there are no clinical data .
the serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pin , Nic@@ op@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these medicines .
in a clinical study where Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of test subjects , the Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with simultaneous administration of War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended due to the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening of the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
simultaneous administration of or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ yl stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1,0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
this medicine may be used during pregnancy only after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study of gravi@@ d rats , which was administered from the in@@ hibition in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during lac@@ tation .
the safety of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to be observed on signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB has been studied both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % hem@@ m@@ RNA concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is located in the range between 0.0@@ 12 and 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in the case of ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in the case of chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
on the other hand , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on these data , the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ag@@ gregation should be considered in therapy optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant fluctu@@ ates the percentage of the free active component during the dosing interval depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , respectively represent a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrate , must be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if given simultaneously with ag@@ gregation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the ren@@ al clear@@ ance of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .

studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
these results indicate that the metabol@@ isation paths are not yet fully developed in juven@@ iles , so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inclusion is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the benefit of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking into account was neither demonstrated in patients with PI pre @-@ treated patients nor with PI pre @-@ treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , aspir@@ in capsules and solution to intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not re@@ plac@@ eable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the patients should , once they are able to swal@@ low the capsules , stop taking the solution for intake ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 28@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , as there is no dosage recommendation for the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take in and low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be avoided , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dosage adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for use in patients with kidney failure is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of high propylene gly@@ co@@ ence , A@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in pregnant women , pregnant women , patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk 47 of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
as@@ gener@@ ase should be stopped permanently if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug 49 dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis are reported .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increased , compared to C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the simultaneous intake of A@@ val@@ ase can considerably increase the plasma concentrations and cause side @-@ effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , blur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
based on the data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected according to oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is unknown . A@@ gener@@ ase solution to intake may not be applied during pregnancy because of possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the included propylene gly@@ col ( see section 4.3 ) .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected in the milk of lac@@ tation @-@ related rats , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk in humans .
a reproduction study of gravi@@ d rats , which was administered from the in@@ hibition in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 55 body weight during lac@@ tation .
the safety of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
many of these events are not clari@@ fied if they are related to the use of A@@ gener@@ ase or any other medicine used for HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral , non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved end@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dosage , the mut@@ ations described in other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r were rarely observed with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors .
early departure of a failing 60 therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 B@@ ased on this data , the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ag@@ gregation should be considered in therapy optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood circulation into the tissue .

it may harm other people even if they have the same discomfort as you . − If any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
your doctor will usually instruc@@ t you to apply A@@ gener@@ ase capsules together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to enhance the effect of ag@@ gregation .
the use of A@@ val@@ ase is based on the individual viral resistance test carried out by your doctor and your treatment history .
tell your doctor if you are suffering from one of the above diseases or taking any of the drugs mentioned above .
if your doctor has recommended that you take A@@ gener@@ ase capsules together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to gain the effect ( booster ) , make sure that you have read the instructions for rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r carefully before starting treatment .
there is also no sufficient information to recommend the application of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules together with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r for strengthening effect in children between 4 and 12 years or generally in patients under 50 kg of body weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore it is important that you read the section &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; When taking A@@ val@@ ase with other medicines &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; before you begin taking A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you may need additional factor VI@@ II to control bleeding . − In patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , a re@@ distribution , accumulation or loss of body fat can occur .

it is recommended that HIV @-@ positive women should not breast@@ feed their children under any circumstances in order to prevent HIV transmission .
transport and operation of machines There were no studies on the influence of ag@@ gregation on driving ability or the ability to operate machinery .
please consult your doctor before you consult your doctor if you are aware that you are suffering from intoler@@ ance to certain sugar@@ s .
if you are taking Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , it is advisable that you take this more than one hour before or after A@@ gener@@ ase , otherwise the effects of ag@@ gregation can be reduced .
dose of A@@ val@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 600 mg twice daily along with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
if your doctor decides that taking rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not suitable for you , you will have to take higher doses ( 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
85 Dam@@ it A@@ gener@@ ase brings as much benefit as possible , it is very important that you take the entire daily dose that your doctor has prescribed for you .
if you have taken a larger amount of ag@@ gregation when you should have taken more than the prescribed dose of ag@@ gregation , you should contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately .
if you &apos;ve forgotten taking A@@ val@@ ase If you &apos;ve forgotten taking A@@ val@@ ase , take it once you think about it and then continue taking as before .
in the treatment of HIV infection , it is not always possible to tell if any side effects are caused by ag@@ gregation , other medicines that are taken at the same time , or caused by the HIV infection itself .

the application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the condition to be treated : • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is to be applied five times a week for six weeks .
before bed@@ time , apply the cream to the affected areas of the skin so that it remains on the skin sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) before it is washed off .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the substance ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies where the patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or placebo were either daily or five times weekly .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . in all four main studies , the total recovery rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with placebo . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete recovery rate of 66 % to 80 % in patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application area of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults , if the size or number of les@@ ions limiting the efficacy and / or accept@@ ability of cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .
Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream continues until all visible hands have disappeared in the genital or per@@ ic@@ um area or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
interruption in the treatment procedure described above should be considered when intense local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if after the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated les@@ ions are cured only in@@ completely , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
if a dose has been missed , the patient will sol@@ der the cream once he / she notices it and then proceed with the usual therapy plan .
apply i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in a thin layer and apply in the cleaned skin area infected with f@@ eig@@ ns until the cream is completely absorbed .
it should take place in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
it should take place in these patients between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host@@ - reaction .
in other studies where no daily pre@@ h@@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and a case were observed with a frac@@ ture leading to circumcision .
when applying I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irritation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases severe local skin irritation was observed , which necess@@ itated treatment and / or caused temporary physical impairment .
in cases where such reactions took place at the outlet of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
no clinical experience has so far been available for the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream directly after treatment with other cut@@ aneous applications for the treatment of external clin@@ ometers in the genital and per@@ ic@@ inal area .
although limited data suggest an increased rate of clin@@ ically positive patients with HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has demonstrated less efficacy in this group of patients with regard to the elimination of the clin@@ ker war@@ ts .
treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips , or hair@@ line was not studied .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions is generally decreased during the therapy or the reactions form after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cre@@ ams .
if it is necessary due to patient complaints or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break of several days may be made .
the clinical outcome of the therapy may be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since there are currently no data on long @-@ term cure rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in cases of super@@ fici@@ ency bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
there are no clinical experience in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , so the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors .
data from an open clinical study indicates that there is less lik@@ el@@ ihood of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy for large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) .
i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or the ears or on the lip area inside the lip@@ id .
there are only very limited data on the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands do not support the effectiveness of this application , so such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions usually decrease in intensity in the course of therapy or go back after the onset of therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cre@@ ams .
if the local skin reactions cause great discomfort to the patient or are very strong , the treatment may be suspended for a few days .
data from an open clinical study showed that patients with more than 8 patients had a lower overall healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
because of the immune @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies do not cause direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although non @-@ recurring serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) were not quanti@@ fiable after several times of topical use , no recommendation can be given to the application during the lac@@ tation period .
the most frequent contribut@@ ors and possibly or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream related side @-@ effects in studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of the hands ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the most common reported and possibly or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream related side @-@ effects include discomfort on the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the bas@@ ali@@ oma patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream from a placebo @-@ controlled phase III clinical study reported side effects are shown below .
the most common adverse event , probably or possibly associated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s application , were in these studies a reaction to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the side effects reported by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
this review of the clinical signs fores@@ een by the protocol shows that placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ creme frequently lead to local skin reactions including er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ c@@ ori@@ ation / di@@ pping / shed ( 23 % ) , ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) .
this evaluation of the clinical signs indicated according to the test plan shows that in these studies , five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ creme frequently resulted in severe er@@ y@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe tumour formation and cal@@ ci@@ fication ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials evaluating the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was determined with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the in@@ adver@@ tent one @-@ time oral absorption of 200 mg of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , was in hyp@@ ot@@ ony that norm@@ alized according to oral or intraven@@ ous fluids .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after topical application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies it could be shown that the efficacy in the case of a complete recovery of the clin@@ ometers at an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment is clearly superior .
60 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od totally healed the patients ; this was the case at 20 % of the patients who had treated placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 15@@ 7 male patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo @-@ treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with five @-@ week use per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ modi@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data presented in an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and that remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , invisible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic human les@@ ions within a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous 25 c@@ m2 area of treatment on the scal@@ p or face .
the two @-@ year data from two combined monitoring studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications of external clin@@ ometers , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose and super @-@ artificial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma do not usually occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies on children between the ages of 2 and 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
in these studies the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or less ) .
minimal systemic intake of the 5 % i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three weekly use during 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentrations in the serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and bet@@ ru@@ gen 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the estimated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study ; this indicates prolonged retention of the drug in the skin .
systemic exposure data showed that the absorption of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od to topical application on MC @-@ sick skin of 6 - 12 years was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or superficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study of der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of kg lead to significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study carried out for four months for the der@@ mal application did not reveal any similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice in mice on three days a week did not indu@@ ce tumours in the application center .
the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ able , a risk for man due to systemic exposure may be regarded as very low .
the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active free cream earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with inferior U@@ VR .
it may harm other people , even though they have the same symptoms as you . − If any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
● F@@ eig@@ ni@@ zen ( Con@@ dy@@ l@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) formed on the skin in the area of gen@@ itals ( sexual organs ) and anus ( anus ) ● superficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma This is a frequently encountered , slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spread to other parts of the body .
if left untreated , it can lead to distor@@ tions , especially in the face - so early detection and treatment is important .
ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses are rough areas of the skin that occur in people who have been exposed to sunlight during their previous life .
Al@@ dar@@ a should only be applied with flat ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses on the face and scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the most suitable treatment for you .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( symptoms which are not related to brain or nerves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not broken down and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints that complic@@ ate movements , decreased lung volume , heart and eye diseases .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic disorders .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be administered in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ alizing devices , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction .

the study mainly examined the safety of the drug , but it was also measured by its effectiveness ( by investigating its effect on the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the children treated showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , ar@@ thr@@ al@@ gia ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion site .
very common side effects in patients under five years of age are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and shi@@ vers .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medi@@ c@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be known each year and , where necessary , update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients receiving Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me regarding the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a permit to transport Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me across the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of the human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mamm@@ ali@@ an cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster o@@ vary , ov@@ arian of Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic disorders .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or h@@ ep@@ atic in@@ suffici@@ ency was not determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment where re@@ vit@@ alization devices for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are available immediately .
due to the phase III clinical trial , nearly all patients are Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since there is little experience regarding resum@@ ption of the treatment after a longer break , the risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions after an interruption of treatment has to be cau@@ ti@@ ously avoided due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of treatment .
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medicines ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti @-@ py@@ re@@ es ) to minimize the potential incidence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of a mild or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the treatment should be contem@@ plated with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in the case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
the in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate at which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ ain because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ enz with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not include direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , fet@@ al embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over breast milk are present , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
adverse events in clinical trials were primarily classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of the patients in the Phase 3 study ( duration of treatment of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of the patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions related to allo@@ az@@ y@@ me observed during the Phase III study and their pro@@ long@@ ation in 45 patients aged 5 or older are listed in the following table according to the following frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory stall and facial oil ( see Section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted drug interactions with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a Ph@@ as@@ e- 2 study involving a total of 20 patients under 5 years of age , with predominantly severe trial form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 I / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 I / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients underwent a serum conversion within 3 months from the onset of treatment , with a more severe form of recur@@ rence in patients under the age of 5 ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) .
up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( resp@@ . to a premature ex@@ cre@@ tory from the study ) , no antibodies that were det@@ ectable by radio@@ immun@@ oph@@ en@@ ci@@ itation ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say were present in 13 / 45 patients , among them 3 patients who had never had a serum conversion .
patients with low antibody levels showed a robust lowering of the G@@ AG mirror in urine , while a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was found in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ al activity in vitro which did not seem to imp@@ air the clinical efficacy and / or decrease of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies seemed not to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the justification for the therapy of the enzyme is one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accum@@ ulating sub@@ str@@ atum and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate enzyme activity .
after IV in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and taken up by cells into the Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via man@@ can @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients between 6 and 43 years of age .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study that showed the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( Fe@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change in the expected Fe@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 minute audi@@ ble test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for another 3,5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) each week .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and the ability to walk , which is shown in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and of 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / al@@ th@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as shown in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of Fe@@ V has not been clin@@ ically significant over this period and absolute lung volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) reached normal liver size by the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks , a clear drop in the G@@ AG mirrors was found in urine ( µ@@ g / mg cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) , which remained constant until the end of the study .
in regard to the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients , which was taken into account by the use of a combined end@@ point , which summari@@ zes clin@@ ically significant changes across five efficacy variables ( expected percentage of normal feed , range of shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , there was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted , in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were investigated in 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion ( 16 patients with severe form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - Mir@@ ror in Har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined according to the Z @-@ score for this age group The younger patients with the severe trial form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental development speed , whereas in older patients with difficult lead @-@ form only limited or no progress in cognitive development was to be determined .
in a phase 4 study , investigations on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing schemes were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in urine , liver volume and 6 @-@ minute walk @-@ test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 I / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 I / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
dosing scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative for patients experiencing difficulty with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent .
the European Medi@@ c@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of patients under the age of 5 was similar to that of older and less severely affected patients .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in a unique dose , toxic@@ ity with repeated dose and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular danger to man .
since no carrier studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines , except those listed under 6.@@ 6 .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug for cancer ) in patients who have not received chemotherapy ( anti @-@ cancer drugs ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body or is probably slightly spread to other parts of the body ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used as the sole therapy in patients who have not previously been treated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies .
to reduce side effects , the patients should have a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an anti@@ em@@ etic drug ( remedy against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( in order to prevent liquid deficiency ) should be given before or after the dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients whose blood is changed or certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , de@@ activated or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed thus slow@@ s down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
the transformation of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into its active form proceeds more easily in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active effect in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural endo@@ theli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study involving 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , were compared to the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) .
in addition , A@@ lim@@ ta was compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another cancer drug ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in 1 7@@ 25 patients who previously had no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin showed an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients with whom cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cell proliferation in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta showed longer survival rates than with the comparable medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta across the European Union .
each water bottle must be dissolved with a 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the penetration block and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de @-@ injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for the first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer , except for predomin@@ ant plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - , advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung carcin@@ oma , except for predomin@@ ant plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface area ( KO@@ F ) is administered as an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion for a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given on the day before and on the day of the mixed @-@ fruit and on the day after the treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid have to be taken and the intake must continue throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) a week before the first mixed dose and after each third treatment cycle .
in patients receiving p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , a complete blood count should be created before each application , including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a plat@@ el@@ et cen@@ sus .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place taking account of the Na@@ dir@@ s of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the early therapy cycles .
after the recovery , patients have to be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grade 2 bleeding .
should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ Grade 3 ( excluding neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient receives the value before treatment
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA has to be canc@@ eled if a ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of 3 or 4 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity occurs in patients after 2 dose reductions .
clinical studies showed no indication that at the age of 65 , a higher secondary effect risk exists in patients between 65 and 65 years of age .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to inadequate data for safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials , no dose adjustment was necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ance ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the dosage adjustments recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with liver function restriction of &gt; 1.5 times the upper bili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - limit and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3,@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( if liver metast@@ ases ) were not studied especially in studies .
patients must be monitored with respect to bone and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be given to patients before their absolute number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils again reaches ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ te number again reaches a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ine number , plat@@ el@@ et count and maximal non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in the preceding treatment courses ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was observed when pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed need to be instructed to apply fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous consumption of non @-@ ster@@ oid@@ al anti @-@ inflammatory drugs ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ sali@@ - cy@@ l@@ acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed therapy must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs with long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before the therapy , day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred had relevant risk factors for the appearance of ren@@ al events including de@@ hydr@@ ation , high blood pressure or diabetes .
therefore , a drainage of the eff@@ usion should be considered in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space prior to p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment .
5 Major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , if this substance was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of irre@@ versi@@ bly damaging the reproductive ability through p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the treatment regi@@ men to obtain advice regarding sperm conservation .
in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ ster@@ oid@@ al anti @-@ inflammatory drugs ( N@@ SA@@ IDs , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) may result in reduced p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed precip@@ itation resulting in increased occurrence of side effects .
it is therefore advisable to use high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
( i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , be avoided at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there is no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ IDs with long half @-@ life such as pi@@ ro@@ x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) when the decision was taken to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected in the case of an application in pregnancy .
p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be applied during pregnancy , except if absolutely necessary and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of irre@@ versi@@ bly damaging the reproductive ability through p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the start of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the blocking of sperm .
it is not known whether p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is transferred into the mother &apos;s milk and unwanted effects on the breast @-@ fed baby can not be ruled out .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma and the random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed and 16@@ 3 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma who random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity , reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasional ) of patients who received random@@ ized p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , included sup@@ rav@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as .
clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity level 3 and 4 was similar to phase 2 mixed @-@ mono@@ therap@@ i@@ ri@@ dia ( n = 164 ) , except for neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in Alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences can probably be traced back to differences in the patient population , as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre@@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal initial values of liver function tests .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects that could be possible in connection with study medication ; they were reported in &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 patients with NSC@@ LC , who received random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed and 8@@ 30 patients with NSC@@ LC which random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ abine .

severe cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular insulin and trans@@ itory isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic attacks were reported occasionally in dental trials with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , which is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
clinical studies have occasionally reported cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal per@@ fo@@ - , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ litis ) in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment .
in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed @-@ treatment , occasionally cases of chronic obstruc@@ tive pulmon@@ ary pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory failure were reported in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment .
there have been cases of acute ren@@ al failure in p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy agents ( see Section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients treated before , during or after their p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ) is an anti@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ freeze which ex@@ erts its effect by interrup@@ ting weight @-@ dependent metabolic processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed acts as an anti@@ fung@@ al with multiple attack points by blocking the thy@@ me de@@ duction ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ ate reduc@@ t@@ ase ( DH@@ FR ) and Gly@@ cin@@ am@@ i@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ d@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , which are fol@@ ate @-@ dependent enzymes of the de nov@@ o Bi@@ osyn@@ thesis by thy@@ mid@@ ine and Pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .

the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the investig@@ ational medicine ( random@@ ised and treated ) in the treatment arm .
statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural carcin@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin @-@ Arm ( 2@@ 12 patients ) in comparison with the sole c@@ is@@ pla@@ in@@ ine arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms showed an improvement of the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deterioration of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multi @-@ center , random@@ ised , open phase III trial with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA versus doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy achieved a medi@@ an survival time of 8.3 months with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA @-@ treated patients ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and 7.@@ 9 months with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the overall survival benefit from A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1.@@ 00 , p = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1.@@ 00 , p = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1,@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data from a random@@ ised controlled phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre @-@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el are similar .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analysis of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination with gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
medi@@ an PFS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.@@ 1 months for the combination gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( 95 % CI = 27.@@ 3 - 3@@ 3.@@ 9 ) for combination gem@@ cit@@ abine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 28.@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1.4 ) .
the analysis of the impact of NSC@@ LC on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences according to hist@@ ology , see table below .

A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 100 mg of powder for the production of an in@@ fusion solution A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg of powder for the production of an in@@ fusion solution
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is used in patients who have received no previous chemotherapy in the treatment of malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma ( malign@@ ant ri@@ b f@@ ells ) in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , another medicine for the treatment of cancer .
if you have a kidney ail@@ ment or earlier , discuss this with your doctor or hospital pharmacy , since you may not be allowed to receive A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA .
blood tests are performed before any in@@ fusion ; it checks whether your kidney and liver function is sufficient and whether you have enough blood cells to get A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA to 49 .
your doctor may possibly change the dose or stop the treatment as long as it requires your general condition and if your blood values are too low .
if you also receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , your doctor will ensure that your body contains sufficient water and you will receive the necessary medicines to prevent vom@@ iting before and after c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
if you have a fluid accumulation around the lungs , your doctor may decide to eliminate this liquid before you get A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA .
if you would like to use a child during the treatment or in the first six months after the treatment , please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
please tell your doctor if you are taking medicines for pain or inflammation ( swelling ) such as medicines called &quot; non@@ ster@@ oid@@ al anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca &quot; ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) , including medicines which are not prescription ( like i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) .
depending on the expected da@@ - tum of your A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in@@ fusion and / or the extent of your kidney function , your doctor will tell you which other medicines you can take and when .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not a prescription medication .
a hospital pharmacy , nursing staff or a doctor will mix A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA powder with sterile 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de @-@ injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) before it is applied to you .
your doctor will prescri@@ be cor@@ tis@@ one tablets ( equivalent to 4 mg of dex@@ am@@ eth@@ an@@ son twice a day ) that you must take on the day before , during and on the day following the application of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA .
your doctor will prescri@@ be fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) for taking or mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amins which contain fo@@ lic acid ( 350 to 1000 micro@@ grams ) , which you must take once a day during the use of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA .
in the week before the use of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and approximately every 9 weeks ( according to 3 cycles of treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ) , you will also receive an injection of Vi@@ - t@@ amin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) .
in this use information , a side effect is described as &quot; very common , &quot; meaning that it was reported by at least 1 out of 10 patients .

dissolve the contents of 100 mg ( 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de ) containing sodium chlori@@ de ( 9 mg / ml ) of sodium chlori@@ de ( 9 mg / ml ) without preserv@@ atives , resulting in a solution with a concentration of about 25 mg / ml .

the resulting solution is clear and the coloring ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish yellow without compromising the quality of the product .
it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with a low @-@ cal@@ orie , fat @-@ reduced diet .
patients receiving All@@ i and receiving no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they can &apos;t break down some fats in the food , resulting in a quarter of the fats associated with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed in the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared with placebo in 3@@ 91 patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 compared to placebo .
in the two studies of patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who had All@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no relevant weight loss could be observed for patients .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s at the anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with fa@@ ec@@ es , stu@@ d@@ ld@@ ring , gre@@ asy / o@@ ily chair , finish o@@ ily ( win@@ ch ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it must not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may also not be used in patients who suffer from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which not enough nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or on ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( a liver disease ) , and in pregnant and breast@@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited for placing Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ cal@@ oric , fat @-@ reduced diet .
all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , since there is not enough data for efficacy and safety .
since or@@ list@@ at is only minimal res@@ or@@ ption , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary in elderly people and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• Super@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other components • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • Chr@@ onic malign@@ ant absorption syndrome ( see section 4.6 ) • Pres@@ sure time ( see section 4.6 ) • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or a fat @-@ rich diet .
since weight loss in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or chem@@ ist before starting treatment with all@@ i , because the dosage of anti@@ diabe@@ tic must be adjusted if necessary .
patients who take al@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of this medicine has to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnancy @-@ preventing measures in order to avoid the possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a reduction of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma level was observed .
for the use of War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values ( international normal ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the levels of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta @-@ carot@@ ene were normal .
however , patients should be advised to take a complementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the administration of a one @-@ off dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a marginal decrease in the as@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time .
animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect negative effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the medication , as the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented .
gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
the abund@@ ances are defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .
the frequency of known side effects found after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown , as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unknown magnitude .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety in regard to possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered at normal and obes@@ e subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose reported after the market launch , either side @-@ effects or similar side @-@ effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on studies on humans and animals , a rapid recovery of any systemic effects that can be traced back to the lip@@ ase properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect sets in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper thin @-@ intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding on the active ser@@ ine @-@ remainder of the ga@@ stri@@ c and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic elev@@ ations .
clinical studies have derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocks the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies on adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ cal@@ oric , fat @-@ reduced diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , has been assessed as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as proportion of those who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( table 2 ) .
although weight loss was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first six months .
the average dietary intake in the Gesamt@@ ch@@ ol@@ esterin was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in LD@@ L cholesterol in or@@ list@@ at was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.8 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the waist circum@@ ference was the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( bas@@ eline 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( bas@@ eline 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could be detected only spor@@ adi@@ cally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation .
in a study with obes@@ e patients who administered the minimal systemic stress , two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after spl@@ itting the N @-@ mol@@ yl @-@ leu@@ cine @-@ group ) , could be identified , representing nearly 42 % of the total plasma concentration .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not show any particular danger to humans .

all@@ i is used for weight reduction and is used in obes@@ e adults aged 18 and over with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 28 or above . all@@ i should be used in conjunction with a low @-@ fat and low @-@ cal@@ orie diet .
BM@@ I helps you to determine whether you have a normal weight or overweight in relation to your body size .
even if these diseases first do not cause you to feel uncomfortable , you should still ask your doctor for a check @-@ up .
for each 2 kg body weight , which you lose during a diet , you can lose an additional kil@@ ogram with the help of all@@ i .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not a prescription medicine .
C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in is used after organ transplan@@ ts , in severe rheumato@@ id arthritis and certain severe skin diseases .
oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives and all@@ i • The effect of or@@ ally @-@ increasing means of contrac@@ eption ( contrac@@ ep@@ tive pill ) may be weakened or cancelled under certain circumstances if you have strong diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) .
before taking all@@ i to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , please contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you : • A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one for the treatment of heart rhythm disorders .
ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take all@@ i and if you take medicines for high blood pressure , as you may need to adjust the dosage .
for more helpful information on the blue pages , see section 6 for more information on how to define your cal@@ orie and fat levels .
if you have a meal or a meal does not contain any fat , do not take a capsule . all@@ i can only work if the food contains fat .
if you take the capsule in conjunction with a meal that contains too much fat , you risk nutritional supplements ( see paragraph 4 ) .
to get used to the new eating habits , start with a cal@@ orie and fat @-@ reduced diet before the first capsule intake .
nutrition di@@ aries are effective as you can always track what you eat , how much you eat and it will probably be easier for you to change your eating habits .
to safely achieve your target weight , you should specify two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat .
• Re@@ duce yourself fat to reduce the lik@@ el@@ ihood of diet @-@ related side effects ( see section 4 ) . • T@@ ry to move more before you begin taking the capsules .
remember to ask your doctor beforehand if you are not accustomed to physical activity . • Sta@@ y physically active while taking and even after taking all@@ i .
• If you cannot find any reduction in weight after twelve weeks of use of all@@ i , ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice .
you may need to stop taking all@@ i . • In case of successful weight loss , it is not about changing the diet at short notice and then returning to the old habits .
• If less than one hour has passed since the last meal , take the intake of the capsule . • If more than one hour has passed since the last meal , take no capsule one .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this use information .
the most common side effects are associated with the mode of action of the capsules and by the fact that more fat is ex@@ cre@@ ted from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of treatment , since at this time you may not have consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet .
with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize nutritional accompanying symptoms : • Beg@@ in several days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favourite foods and about the size of the portions you normally consume .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ el@@ ihood of you to exceed your fat limit decreases . • Share your recommended fat amount equally on daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you may consume each meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main court or a tasty dessert , as you may have done in other programs for weight reduction .
• Do not store pharmaceuticals for children . • Do not store al@@ i according to exp@@ ir@@ ation date stated on the cart@@ on . • Ke@@ ep container tightly closed to protect contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lica gel that serve to keep the capsules dry .
• Do not swal@@ low them . • You can carry your daily dose of all@@ i in the blue transport box ( shuttle ) which is included in this package .

alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies that are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic ) .
the use of patients under 18 years of age is not recommended because there is not enough information about the effects in this age group .
this means that the agent prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was examined in three main studies of 1,@@ 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong or moderate causes of nausea and vom@@ iting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 from 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in the case of chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of the patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 from 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 from 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd to appro@@ ve the marketing of Alo@@ xi across the European Union .
alo@@ xi is indicated : for prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy because of cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy because of cancer .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for preventing nausea and vom@@ iting that is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy may be ampli@@ fied by adding a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the spread of the col@@ on , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ st@@ ination or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is required with simultaneous use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with drugs that extend the Q@@ T interval or if the Q@@ T interval is prolonged or which tend to be an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi is not to be used for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics investigated by tum@@ ors ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
a clinical study showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ St@@ ate@@ - Con@@ centr@@ ation of oral Met@@ o@@ clo@@ pra@@ i@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hibit@@ ors ( D@@ exam@@ eth@@ as@@ one and Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ dine , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Ch@@ ini@@ dine , Ran@@ iti@@ dine , Ser@@ tral@@ ine and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant effect on the clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience for the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies is not present , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician .
in clinical trials , the most common adverse events with a dose of 250 micro@@ grams were observed ( 6@@ 33 patients ) , at least possibly associated with Alo@@ xi , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the administration ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post marketing testim@@ oni@@ als .
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar occur@@ ren@@ ces of adverse events as in other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effect relationships to be observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out , however , due to the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective treatment in an Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide ( half @-@ life time 4 hours ) or 100 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life 7.@@ 3 hours ) were compared with intraven@@ ous 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one on day 1 .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients who received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ine , and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , were compared with patients who received 32 mg on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , given intraven@@ ously on day 1 .
results of studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
in clinical trials for indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of pre @-@ clinical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the duration of the action potential .
the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy subjects was the assessment of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After IV administration an initial decrease in plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination from the body with an average termin@@ ale half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are usually dos@@ ed propor@@ tionally in the entire dose range of 0.@@ - 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
following IV dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase in pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations show that once daily intraven@@ ous dose of 0.@@ 25 mg of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to 3 consecutive days , the overall texture ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) was comparable with the value measured after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the dispos@@ able dose of 0.@@ 75 mg .
approximately 40 % are eliminated through the kidneys and about 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor in comparison to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
in vitro studies for metabol@@ isation showed that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser degree , the I@@ so@@ enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination after an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ modified ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
following a unique intraven@@ ous bol@@ us injection , the total length of the body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although patients with severe liver function disorder increases the terminal and the average systemic exposure to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , a reduction in the dose is not justified .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects have been observed only after expos@@ ures that are considered adequately above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use .
10 out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , evidence suggests that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block in very high concentrations of ion channels which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and can pro@@ long the duration of action .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose was equivalent to the 30@@ x of the therapeutic exposure in humans ) given every day over two years led to an increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( thy@@ roid gland , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al glands ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages and since Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for one @-@ time use , the relevance of these results is assessed as low for humans .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report recommended for the approval of the drug Al@@ ph@@ e@@ 6 million IE / ml injection solution prescribed for the treatment of hepatitis C .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same pharmac@@ eu@@ tically effective ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by a viral infection ) .
in the case of a micro@@ scopic examination , the liver tissue damages damage , in addition , the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ o S@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood .
a yeast produces a gene ( DNA ) which stimulates the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data comparing Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of operation , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of al@@ ph@@ eon was compared to the efficacy of the reference medicinal product to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was set ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA is acknowledged What were the biggest concerns that prompted the CH@@ MP to refuse permission for placing on the market ?
furthermore , concerns were expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed is not sufficient .
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eus and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical trial .
after setting up the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon the disease was again flamm@@ able in more patients than with the reference doctor . in addition , Al@@ ph@@ eus had more side effects .
apart from this , the study used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug acts as an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) is not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be used for the treatment of im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection with crust formation ) and small infected la@@ in@@ ers ( crack or cut wounds ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wed wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections , which have been proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ e. Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , because Alar@@ go may not have an effect against this type of infection .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients aged nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age , the skin area to be treated must not exceed 2 % of the body &apos;s surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced ) , thereby inhibit@@ ing the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection had been cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo responded to treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken together with skin dogs , about 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( bladder @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections caused or presumably by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is a irritation at the job center .
the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go were out@@ weighed in the short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small la@@ ths , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn up wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . , approved for the launch of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union .
the patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in case of a sensi@@ tization or severe local irritation due to the use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ine o@@ int@@ ment , the treatment is broken off , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully wi@@ ped out and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection is started .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ in- is not intended to be used for the treatment of infections , where MR@@ SA is known as a patho@@ gen or is suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials of secondary @-@ infected open wounds the efficacy of retin@@ am@@ in- in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
an alternative therapy should be taken into account if no improvement or deterioration of the infected spot occurs after a 2 to 3 @-@ day treatment .
the impact of simultaneous use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ in- and other topical remedies on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after topical application on poor skin or infected superficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vivo is not expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the medi@@ al retin@@ ot@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x increased by 81 % according to topical application of 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ine o@@ int@@ ment on sk@@ imm@@ ed skin of healthy adult men .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dosage adjustments are not considered necessary when topical retin@@ ob@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are insufficient with regard to a statement on impact on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
retin@@ am@@ ine o@@ int@@ ment should only be used during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retin@@ ob@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the application of systemic antibiotics .
if breast@@ feeding continues / stops or the therapy should be continued / terminated with Al@@ tar@@ go , the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the baby and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for woman should be considered .
in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was the most commonly reported side @-@ effect irritation at the administration , involving about 1 % of the patients .
mode Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ in- is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mechanism of action of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ in- is based on the selective in@@ hibition of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction on a specific binding site of the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding site is involved in the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase Center .
by binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits pe@@ p@@ tide transfer , block partial P @-@ binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if , due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance , the application of retin@@ ot@@ ulin at least some forms of infection appears question@@ able , consultation with experts should be sought .
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of retin@@ ol compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , irrespective of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in the event of non @-@ response to treatment in S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of strains with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a healthy adult study , 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ine o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion to intact and de@@ ath@@ ed skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , which received 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ine o@@ int@@ ment twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secon@@ dar@@ ily infected trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
the sampling took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic intake of people after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 of de@@ ported skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ in- IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP im@@ itation .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabol@@ isms of retin@@ ot@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ s was primarily medi@@ ated through C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , under low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid disorders .
in @-@ vitro analysis of gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes and in rats micro@@ nucle@@ us for in @-@ vivo analysis of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither male nor female rats showing signs of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which was achieved up to 5 times higher exposure compared to the highest estimated exposure in humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 of de@@ ported skin ) :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study on rats , oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , develop@@ mental toxic@@ ity ( decreased body weight of fo@@ etus and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity were determined .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years who are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of an existing vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , and a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may be used only if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation , and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses can be completed .
if a ref@@ res@@ her dose is desirable for hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another Hepatitis A@@ - or -@@ B vaccine may be given .
vacc@@ ines act by contributing to the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , as it can defend itself against a disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and generates antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as the Twin@@ rix adult vaccine , which has been approved since 1996 and has been approved since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are given as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix included identical ingredients , some of the data supporting the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence of the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six month period and a 12 month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix carried out a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children .
the additional study showed that Ambi@@ rix &apos;s degree of protection was similar to a six @-@ month interval between inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix are headache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , mat@@ ur@@ ation ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smi@@ th@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals .
the standardi@@ zation plan for imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two doses of vacc@@ ines , the first dose is administered at the date of the choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a booster shot is desired for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B , the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or a combination vaccine can be vacc@@ inated .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ Hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ Hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ Hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) were observed in the same magnitude as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured , whether immun@@ o@@ competent individuals who have addressed a Hepatitis A@@ - vacc@@ ination may need a booster shot as protection , since they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in case of non @-@ det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , appropriate options for medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately for the rare case of an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the application of the vaccine .
if a quick protection against hepatitis B is needed , the combination vaccine is recommended , containing a 360 @-@ degree immun@@ o@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the case of ha@@ em@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and individuals with disorders of the immune system , there may be no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody @-@ value after the basic di@@ mm@@ ination , so that the administration of further vacc@@ ines may be necessary in these cases .
because intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could lead to a sub@@ optimal outcome , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
in the case of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , however , ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ e@@ ously since it can occur in these cases after intra@@ muscular administration of bleeding .
if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the form of a separate injection simultaneously using a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ a- , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it must be assumed that no adequate immune response may be achieved .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ ation , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the former de@@ glomer@@ ation and preserv@@ ative @-@ based ino@@ cul@@ ation formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 ino@@ cul@@ ation doses of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations were given at the age of 1 to including 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years , Ambi@@ rix &apos;s compatibility with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine was compared .
the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ ur@@ ry on a calculation basis for each ino@@ cul@@ ation dose ambi@@ rix , but not on one basis of the calculation per person .
pain was observed after the dose of Ambi@@ rix at 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the subjects compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in subjects after the dose of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
according to the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had given Ambi@@ rix reported pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in subjects vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ur@@ ation was comparable ( i.e. throughout the entire vaccine cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix in comparison with 3@@ 6.2 % of subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the incidence of pronounced pain and mat@@ ur@@ ation was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a comparative study at 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the share of vacc@@ ines reported on serious side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was statisti@@ cally not different .
in clinical trials conducted with vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the rate of serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V was 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. , in month 7 ) .
the serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose of the month after the second dose ( i.e. , in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - to 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was evalu@@ able , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher compared to Ambi@@ rix in the month 2 and 6 after the dose of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine .
the immune responses reported in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full vaccine series ( i.e. , in month 7 ) are listed in the following table .
both studies received either a 2 @-@ dose ino@@ cul@@ ation scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination vaccine containing 360 ELISA units of formula @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in persons who were between 12 and 15 years old at the time of pri@@ me@@ tization , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected for at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immune response observed in this study against both anti@@ gens was comparable to that found after vacc@@ ination of 3 cans with a combination vaccine , consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ one A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical trial at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds it could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme compared to that in the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix was given at the same time at the same time the booster dose of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ a- , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined m@@ umps @-@ m@@ umps vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study carried out with 3 doses of the present formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and serum conversion rates as for the earlier formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing of any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .
in accordance with Article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state batch approval is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorized for this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted via viral foods and drinks but can also be transferred through other ways , such as bathing in waters contaminated by water .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms which may make in@@ patient treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix may not fully protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccine series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child is already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix is ( although you / your child is not yet un@@ healthy or ill at the time of vacc@@ ination ) , a vaccine may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis C or hepatitis B infection cannot be conveyed .
• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction may be caused by it@@ ching skin rash , short@@ ness of breath , or swelling of the face or tongue . • If your child has an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B , if you / your child have a serious infection with fever .
• If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usually scheduled dose of the second vaccine ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from an ino@@ cul@@ ation with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , it will recommend to you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ) .
the second ino@@ cul@@ ation dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered one month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection prior to completion of the vaccine series .
sometimes , Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected into people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders under the skin and not into the muscle . • If you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s defense / or if you / your child is undergoing a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child can take other medicines ( including those that you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child have recently been vacc@@ inated / or if you / your child have received / has received / has given or has planned this in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as many different extre@@ mi@@ ties as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ rix is not given to pregnant or breast@@ feeding women unless it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B .
important information about certain other ingredients of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very often ( more than 1 case per 10 im@@ pregn@@ ated cans ) : • pain or discomfort on the insertion point or redness • Mat@@ ernity • irrit@@ ability • headache • lack of appetite
♦ often ( up to 1 case per 10 dil@@ uted doses ) : • swelling at the injection point • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • Test@@ ed for gastro@@ intestinal disorders
other side effects , which were reported very rarely days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( less than 1 case per 10,000 reported doses ) are :

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of data , which have become known for placing first approval for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP noted that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , as Ambi@@ rix was put into circulation only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposition .
am@@ moun@@ ts can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ complete enz@@ ym@@ atic defect or hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage as a result of high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
ammon@@ ia is divided into several individual doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under food or administered via a gastro@@ intestinal hose ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of the leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach leading hose ) .
there was no comparative study as Am@@ mon@@ t@@ aps could not be compared with any other treatment or placebo ( a pseu@@ do @-@ drug , i.e. without active ingredient ) .
am@@ moun@@ ts may also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste disturbances or taste , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented too high ammon@@ ia levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ t@@ aps was approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval limited information on this drug . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated by all patients in which a complete lack of an enzyme has already manifested itself in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late mani@@ feste form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests after the first month of life ) , there is an indication for use if hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy is present in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually , taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake required for the growth and development of the patient .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as adol@@ escent and adults .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required in patients suffering from an early loss of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine @-@ scar@@ yl@@ ase .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine @-@ ar@@ gin@@ ine @-@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency should receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15,@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets can not be administered to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk for the formation of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets don &apos;t get into the stomach immediately .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , respectively 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
therefore , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium retention and o@@ ede@@ ma .
since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate through the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used only with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results with regard to pregnant women is not known ; therefore , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in young rats at high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal proliferation and increased neur@@ onal loss occurred .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve end@@ ings in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted during humans into breast milk , and for this reason , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during lac@@ tation is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , at least one adverse event ( AE ) occurred in 56 % of the patients and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an eigh@@ teen @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ex@@ ic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tate , heavy hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ ed neu@@ rop@@ athy , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 month old inf@@ ant with an accidental single dose of 10@@ g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed doses of doses of up to 400 mg / kg per day for intraven@@ ous administration of doses of neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is an metabolic active compound that is con@@ jug@@ ated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine that is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to a ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 Pati@@ ents with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate , which is taken for each gram , can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is started immediately to improve the chances of survival and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the earliest onset of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ used , and the disease led to death even in the treatment of per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues within the first year of their life .
ha@@ em@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate , sodium ben@@ zene and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns in post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first month of life ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and who were already treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ a@@ em@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with time with many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ otic form of the or@@ ni@@ thine @-@ scar@@ c@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were re@@ covering from hyper@@ sensitivity en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated permanently with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is enzy@@ mati@@ cally con@@ jug@@ ated with glut@@ amine in the liver and kidneys , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined after a single dose of 5 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis as well as repeated doses of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients following intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate in tablet form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate were detected in 15 minutes after the intake .
according to different doses , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) showed no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma in the majority of patients with ure@@ a disturbances or hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the liver , which were treated repeatedly with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma cruci@@ ble were five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is ex@@ cre@@ ted in 24 hours to approximately 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate had no treatment with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who cannot swal@@ low tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or a gastro@@ intestinal tube or a nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required in patients suffering from an early loss of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine @-@ scar@@ yl@@ ase .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
if p@@ atten@@ s were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite from phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate ) prior to birth , les@@ ions in the cor@@ tex cells of the cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex occurred .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an eigh@@ teen @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ex@@ ic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tate , heavy hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ ed neu@@ rop@@ athy , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to a ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
on the basis of studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it may be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate is produced for each gram between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate in gran@@ ules , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate were detected in 15 minutes after the intake .
during the duration of the shelf life , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature not exceeding 25 ° C .
in this procedure the small measuring spoon contains 0.@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate .
if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot separate the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accumulate after the consumption of proteins in the body .
if laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate can affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not a prescription medicine .
during breast@@ feeding , you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as the medicine may pass into the breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , head@@ aches , taste disturbances , distur@@ b@@ ance of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and wor@@ sen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions have been observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor or emergency doctor in order to initiate an appropriate treatment .
if you miss taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

30 If laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate can affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not a prescription medicine .
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS in the same single boxes or@@ ally or via a ga@@ stri@@ c tube ( tube , which runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose which is led through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Take from the container a he@@ aped measuring spoon of gran@@ ulate . • Send a straight edge , e.g. a knife edge over the top of the knife to remove any excess gran@@ ules . • The amount remaining in the measuring spoon is equivalent to a measuring spoon . • Dis@@ cover the recommended number of measuring spo@@ ons gran@@ ules from the container .
an@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in inst@@ able ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stress &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measured value in the electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if an@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients undergoing PCI , a higher dose is given and the in@@ fusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of An@@ gi@@ ox was compared with any dose or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination treatment with he@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I .
during the PCI , patients often had a st@@ ent ( a short tube left in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots such as ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without GP@@ I - was as effective as conventional treatment in the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year .
in patients undergoing PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective in all indicators as he@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
an@@ gi@@ ox may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine , other hi@@ ru@@ dine , or any of the other ingredients .
it may also not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as for people with severe high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection .
the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that an@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for he@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Company The Medi@@ c@@ ines Company UK Ltd to sell An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST ho@@ ist@@ ing inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) in case of emergency intervention or early intervention .
the recommended starting dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous bol@@ us release of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is performed in a further sequence , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention .
according to clinical requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately before the procedure a release of 0.5 mg / kg is to be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure .
the recommended dosage of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous bol@@ us release of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
the safety and efficacy of an all @-@ in @-@ one bol@@ us application of An@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended , even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , a second bolt release of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be carried out .
in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT levels , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted drug should be carefully mixed prior to use and the bol@@ us dose should be administered intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT value amounts to more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1,@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate ren@@ al function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is under 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose should be checked again .
in patients with moderate ren@@ al damage , which were included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which resulted in the approval , the ACT was 5 minutes after the application of the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in patients with di@@ aly@@ sis an@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with an@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the end of the intraven@@ ous injection of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of low @-@ molecular heat .
• Know@@ n hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or any other component or against hi@@ ru@@ dine • active bleeding or an increased risk of bleeding due to mal@@ functioning of the hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis system and / or ir@@ reversible endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis @-@ based patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even though most of the hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges in arter@@ ial pun@@ cture sites occur in PCI patients under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , patients with a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can cause bleeding in principle .
in patients receiving War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after completion of the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din again reaches the existing level before treatment .
starting from the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations ) it can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological ha@@ em@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters are regularly checked .
animal experiments are insufficient in relation to the effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tional he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparison groups treated with he@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges were defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges as in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both light and severe hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges performed significantly less frequently than in the groups with he@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ or plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY difficult hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge at the point of point , reduction of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in level ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood supply , reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood supply , re@@ operation due to bleeding , using blood products for trans@@ fusion .
other , less commonly observed bleeding loc@@ aliz@@ ations , which occurred in more than 0.1 % ( occasional ) , were &quot; mis@@ cellaneous &quot; pun@@ cture sites , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat .
the following facts about side effects are based on data from a clinical trial with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing PCI .
both in the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparison groups treated with he@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both light and severe bleeding occurred less frequently in the comparison group than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects not listed above have been reported in practice after a comprehensive application and are group@@ ed according to system organ@@ classes in table 6 .
in case of over@@ dose , the treatment with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine is immediately ab@@ rupt and the patient is closely monitored with regard to signs of bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bo@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both the cataly@@ tic center as well as the ion @-@ binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , irrespective of whether th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in is present in the liquid phase or in cl@@ ots .
the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din to th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in , and therefore its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in in turn re@@ generates the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , through Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din with serum from patients who had come to he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) , no th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te ag@@ gregation response was induced .
in healthy subjects and in patients , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din shows a dose @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is att@@ ested by the pro@@ long@@ ation of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was performed in the following cases , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with unstable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ raising inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either prior to angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or at the PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , requiring angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were uni@@ form@@ ly distributed across the 3 treatment arms .
about 77 % of patients had a recurring isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EC@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent angi@@ ography within 72 hours .

the 30 @-@ day results , based on four@@ fold and triple @-@ end@@ points of a random@@ ised double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing PCI ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , are presented in table 10 .
clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the use of an@@ det@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine were evaluated in patients undergoing a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) and in patients with ACS .
bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine is expected to have a cat@@ abol@@ ism in its amino acid components with subsequent re@@ plac@@ ements of the amino acids in the body pool .
the primary metabol@@ ite resulting from the split of the AR@@ G@@ 3 Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence through th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis is not effective due to the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
in patients with normal kidney function , elimination takes place after a first order process with a terminal half @-@ time of 25 ± 12 minutes .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity or reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not detect any particular danger to man .
toxic@@ ity in animals with repeated or continuous exposure ( 1 day to 4 weeks in an exposure to 10 @-@ fold of the clinical @-@ state plasma concentration ) confined itself to overl@@ apping pharmac@@ ological effects .
side effects as a result of a longer @-@ term physiological burden as a response to non @-@ home@@ ost@@ atic co@@ ag@@ ulation were not observed after short @-@ term exposure comparable to those in clinical application , even at very much higher dosage .
if the ready @-@ to @-@ use solution is not under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions , it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .
An@@ gi@@ ox is a freeze @-@ dried powder in single @-@ dose @-@ chu@@ ck bottles of type 1 glass to 10 ml , closed with a but@@ yl rubber stop@@ per and sealed with a cap made of pressed aluminium .
5 ml sterile water for injection uses are given in a defle@@ c@@ tor bottle An@@ gi@@ ox and slightly wa@@ ved until everything has dissolved completely and the solution is clear .
5 ml is removed from the water bottle and dil@@ uted with 5 % glucose solution for injection or 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de solution for injection in a total volume of 50 ml to obtain a final concentration of 5@@ mg / ml bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years of age with diabetes who need treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose ( sugar ) in the blood or which cannot process insulin efficiently .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very little by human@@ insulin , and the change means that it acts faster and has shorter duration than a short @-@ acting human@@ insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in the case of type 2 diabetes , in which the body cannot work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin secre@@ tion was observed after six months .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % for human acting insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adjusted if administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Germany GmbH a permit for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra across the European Union .
as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the delta muscle , or by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdominal wall .
due to the reduced glu@@ con@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin needs can be reduced in patients with a reduction in liver function .
any change in the effect of insulin , the brand ( producers ) , insulin yp@@ s ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the method of production can change the insulin demand .
3 An insufficient dose or abor@@ tion of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening .
changing a patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage .
the timing of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the effect of the insulin used and can therefore vary when the treatment plan is switched .
the substances that increase blood sugar @-@ lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ con@@ ver@@ ting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ co @-@ oxid@@ ase , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , Pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ene , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ antibiotics .
in addition , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c anti @-@ regulation can be weakened or absent from the effects of symp@@ a@@ thetic drugs such as bet@@ ab@@ lo@@ osen , c@@ lon@@ i@@ din , gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and reser@@ pine .
animal experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human@@ insulin regarding pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine occurs in the human breast milk , but generally insulin does not exceed the mother &apos;s milk nor is it res@@ or@@ bed to oral application .
in the following , the adverse drug candidates , known from clinical trials , are group@@ ed according to system organ@@ classes and sorted according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .

eyel@@ ash d@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy is missed to continuously change the injection site within the injection range , as a result , a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy can occur at the injection site .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias involving un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , given by a correspon@@ dingly trained person , or by intraven@@ ous injection of glucose by a doctor .
after an injection of glucose , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose up@@ take ( especially by skel@@ etal muscul@@ ature and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine the effect occurs faster and the effect time is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study involving 18 males aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes , insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in showed a proportional amount of glucose compared to 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg and a dispro@@ portion@@ ately proportional increase in the glu@@ cos@@ ine effect , just like human@@ insulin .
insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a double as fast effect as normal human@@ insulin and achieves the full glu@@ cos@@ ine effect about 2 hours earlier than human@@ insulin .
the data showed that a similar post @-@ pran@@ dial gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved in an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , like with a human acting insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
after 2 minutes before the meal , an insulin inhibit@@ or was achieved than with a human acting insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
when insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is turned in 15 minutes after the meal begins , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved such as for human acting insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ dd@@ les before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin inhibit@@ or in 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal was given ( figure 1A ) before the start of the meal ( figure 1A ) as well as in comparison with human acting insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin inhibit@@ or in 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal compared to humane double @-@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) .
