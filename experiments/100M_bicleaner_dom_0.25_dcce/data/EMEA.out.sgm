<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) evaluated the conducted studies in order to get recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your disease or treatment, please read the package insert (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you would like further information regarding the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for taking in (1 mg / ml) and as injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. Humble thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • bipolar-I disorder, a mental disorder where patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal conspiration) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the drug in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for fast control of increased unrest or behavioural disorders, if the oral consumption of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both cases, the solution can be applied to take in or the processed tablets in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who take other medicines at the same time, which are broken down as well as Abilify, the amount of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This interferes with the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that facilitate the communication of nerve cells.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole is thought primarily to be a "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole acts like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser extent than neurotransmitters work to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">As dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole helps to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing its recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies of up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which suffered from increased restlessness, over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence in 160 patients with which the manic symptoms had already been stabilised with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from increased restlessness, compared with Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in the patient's symptoms was investigated using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the enamel tablets and the solution for taking in (recording).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, showed a significantly greater reduction in symptoms than those who received placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder, abilify decreased in four of five short-term studies of manic symptoms more effectively than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, Abilify prevented the recurrence of manic episodes up to 74 weeks more effectively than placebo in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses also reduced the symptoms more effectively than placebo and were similar to lauazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of abilify (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled sugar), nausea, vomiting, nausea, vomiting, nausea, vomiting (increased saliva production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleeping disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who mainly had manic episodes and in which the manic episodes responded to treatment with Aripiprazole versus the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">Moreover, the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in the fast control of increased unrest and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, if an oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for the transfer of abilify across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar-ion disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes on treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased efficacy in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of abilify in schizophrenia and bipolar disorders in patients ≥ 65 years of age has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">Considering the greater sensitivity of this group of patients, a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 Inductor is released from combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dosage (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic disorders and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after onset or after a change of an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results from an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, overflow disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions which predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolmia, treatment with blood-lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acoterated and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If there are signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia in a patient treated with Abilify, it should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of a MNS or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripiprazole should be applied with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or at states associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there was in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response to undesirable cerebrovascular events involving patients treated with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events associated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents which allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipite, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored regarding a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbidities, the use of anti-psychotics, where weight gain is known as side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is required when Aripiprazl is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines with overlapping side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study involving healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'bad' (poor ') Metabolism the common application of high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="53">Taking into account the joint gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, the potential benefit should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV proteaseinase inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After replacing the CYP2D6- or 3A4-inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify to the can height should be raised to the dose height before beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escuopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be administered with a moderate increase in the aria concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolisms of the mediums of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphic / 3-methoxymorphine-Ratio), 2C19 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazl) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphic).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Because of the insufficient data situation for safety in humans and due to the concerns raised in animal studies on animals, this drug may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of using dangerous machinery, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazl has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks, a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathón, Dystonia and Dyskinesia emerged, compared with patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients under Aripiprazole was 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole was 15.1% in patients under Olanicial therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder - In a controlled study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients with haloperidol-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients under Aripiprazole was 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term period of over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment was 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes of the routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Elevations of CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">The side effects that may occur in connection with an anti-psychotic therapy and about whose appearance has also been reported in the treatment with Aripiprazole include maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and varicose attacks, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementias, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintended or intentional acute overdoses with Aripiprazole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">There is no information about the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole; however, it is unlikely that haemodialysis is useful in the treatment of overdose because Aripiprazole has a high plasma membrane connection.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder is mediated on the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazole showed in vitro a high affinity with dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1 and 5HT2a receptor as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D4, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and to histamine-H1 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the dose of Aripiprazole in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks on healthy subjects, positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent decrease in the binding of 11C racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, on the nucleus caudatus and at the putt.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazl showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 the proportion of responder patients adhering to study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazl 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current measurement scales, which were defined as secondary study targets including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger recovery than with Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole showed a significant reduction in the rate of recurrence in 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanician-controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia for 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study goal was' weight gain ', an increase of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazl showed a efficacy opposite placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study of 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazl showed no superior efficacy opposite placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazl showed a efficacy comparable to placebo in week 3 and a conservation effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, Aripiprazole showed a similar proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania in week 12 such as lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which in part did not apply to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum concentrations, the companion therapy with Aripiprazl demonstrated superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long-term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who achieved remission with Aripiprazl during a stabilisation phase before randomisation, Aripiprazl presented himself superior to the prevention of a bipolar relapse, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the elongation and hydroxyation of Aripiprazole, the N-Dealkylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The average Eliminationshal period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole for extensive metabolisitors over CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours with poor 'poor' metabolisians via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, and in the pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients there are no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A simulation-specific analysis of pharmacokinetics did not reveal any clinically significant differences regarding the ethnicity or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data did not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicological significant effects were only observed in dosages or expositions that exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (lipofuscin-pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to 3 to 10 times the middle Steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">Cholelithiasis was detected as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates from Aripiprazole in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the middle Steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or 16 to 8 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found concentrations of the sulphate-conjugate of hydroxy- Aripiprazl were not found at more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the Gall of monkeys, and are far below the limit values (6%) of the in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits these effects were observed after dosages leading to expositions of the 3- and 11 times the middle steady-state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="144">Once clinically appropriate, the treatment should be terminated with Aripiprazl injection solution and begin with the oral application of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="145">In order to increase resorption and to minimise variability, an injection is recommended in the M. deltoideus or deep into the gluteus maximus muscle while circumventing obese regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) can be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines that have already been used for maintenance or acutely treatment (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a further oral treatment is indicated with Aripiprazole, see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to Abilify tablets, Abilify enamel tablets or Abilify solution.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no studies on the efficacy of Aripiprazl injection solution in patients with detachment and behavioural disorders caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar-I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is deemed necessary in addition to the Aripiprazole injection solution, the patients should be observed with regard to extreme sedation or a blood pressure drop (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Research on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazl Injection Solution is not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (prescribed or illegal).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, overflow disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions which predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolmia, treatment with blood-lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acoterated and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, stiffness, changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and heart rhythm disorders).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipite, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored regarding a worsening of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar mania because of comorbidities, the use of anti-psychotics, where weight gain is known as side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared to that of Aripiprazole, in a study where healthy volunteers Aripiprazole (15 mg dose) was used as one-time indication intramuscularly and which simultaneously received Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In CYP2D6 'bad' (poor ') metabolisations the common application of high-effective inhibitors of CYP2D6 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- proteaseinase inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After replacing the CYP2D6- or 3A4-inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify to the can height should be raised to the dose height before beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly received, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared to that of the sole gift of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following side effects were more common in clinical trials with Aripiprazl injection solution (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">107 The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as potential medically relevant side-effects (*) in clinical trials (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment was 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term period of over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazole was 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes of the routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Elevations of CPK (creatinphosphate kinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">Side effects that may occur in connection with an anti-psychotic therapy and about whose appearance has also been reported in the treatment with Aripiprazole include maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and varicose attacks, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementias, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders was the Aripiprazl injection solution associated with statistically significant greater improvements of aggregation / behavioural dysfunction compared with placebo and was similar to Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as detachment and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazl injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms of aggregation and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The average improvement observed at the PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour end point was 5.8 for placebo, 9,6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe aggregation, a similar efficacy was observed regarding the overall population, but a statistical significance could be determined based on a reduced number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazl (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 the proportion of responder patients adhering to study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazl 77% (oral) and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current measurement scales, which were defined as secondary study targets including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger recovery than with Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole (oral) showed a significantly greater reduction in the rate of recurrence by 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an Olanician-controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia for 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study goal was' weight gain ', a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which in part did not apply to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum concentrations, the companion therapy with Aripiprazl demonstrated superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74-week extension in manic patients who achieved remission with Aripiprazl during a stabilisation phase before randomisation, Aripiprazl presented himself superior to placebo in the prevention of a bipolar relapse, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">The Aripiprazole AUC in the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection was 90% greater than the AUC after the dose of the same dose as a tablet; systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy subjects, the average time until reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The gift of Aripiprazl Injection Solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated use in systemic exposure (AUC), the 15- and 5-times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra-muscle layers.</seg>
<seg id="185">Studies on reproductive toxicity following IV administration showed no safety-related concerns after maternal exposure, 15- (rats) and 29-mal (rabbits) over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on the conventional studies using Aripiprazole (oral) for safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data did not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicological significant effects were only observed in dosages or expositions, which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans; therefore, they have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (lipofuscin-pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to 3 to 10 times the middle steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">Cholelithiasis was detected as a result of the precipitation of sulfate conjugates from Aripiprazole in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the middle steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was investigated in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, of which about three quarters earlier had obtained an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in the sole dose or as monotherapy) was compared with the medication containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other drugs for reducing the side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">In total, 72 (31%) of 229 patients treated with Abraxane responded to treatment compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients receiving conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">Considering only those patients who were treated for the first time in metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference in efficacy indicators such as time to worsening the disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">On the other hand, patients who had previously received other treatments from their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may also not be used in patients who have low neutrophils in their blood before the treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) found that the treatment of Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel versus conventional paclitaxel drugs and that in contrast to other medicines containing paclitaxel it does not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Abraxis BioScience Limited for the launch of Abraxane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients whose first-line treatment for metastatic disease is missing and for which a standard anthracycline-containing therapy is not shown (see also section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophic count &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the subsequent series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In the case of sensory neuropathy degrees 3, treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached at grade 1 or 2, and at all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="278">There is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustment in patients with mild to moderate liver function impairment (see section 4.4. and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="279">There were no studies with patients with impaired renal function and there is currently no adequate data to recommend dose adjustment in patients with impairment of kidney function (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="280">Abraxane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to inadequate data for safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="281">Abraxane is an albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel which could have much other pharmacological features than other formulations of paclitaxel (see section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should be stopped immediately and symptomatic treatment is initiated, and the patient may not be treated again with paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="283">In the case of patients no renewed Abraxane treatment cycles should be initiated until the number of neutrophils rose again &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thrombocyte number is increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver function disorders (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">While a clearly associated cardiotoxicity has not been proven, cardiac outages in the indicated patient group are not uncommon, especially in patients with previous anthracycline treatment or underlying heart or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">If the patient has nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea following the application of Abraxane, they can be treated with the usual antiemetic and constipating means.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used in pregnant women or women in childbearing age, who do not practice effective contraception, except the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel is essential.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women at childbearing age should use a reliable contraception method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients treated with Abraxane will be advised to not bear a child during and up to six months after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised of a sperm count prior to treatment because the therapy with Abraxane means the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as fatigue (very common) and dizziness (often) which can affect the traffic and ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and major incidents of side-effects that occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma who were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in the pivotal phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most conspicuous important haematological toxicity (reported in 79% of the patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anaemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 shows the side effects associated with the dose of Abraxane as monotherapy in each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (≥ 1 / 10,000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: elevated blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, bloating, tongue burning, dry mouth, loose gum, loose stools, oesophagitis, sores in the lower abdomen, sores in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest body, weakness of muscles, neck pain, pain in the skeletal musculature, bacon pain, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakness Very common:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite in relation to a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual incidence are possible and no causal connection with these events has been established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is a microtubules active in the microtubules and stabilizes microtubules by inhibiting their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization results in an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates transcytosis of plasma components into the endothelial cells and in the framework of in-vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin supports the transport of paclitaxel through endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transenselthelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 albuminal receptor and acts as a paclitaxel accumulation in the tumor due to the albumatous protein SPARC (secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine).</seg>
<seg id="306">The use of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two randomised studies and 454 patients treated in a randomised phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In one study, 43 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion of over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used in 63 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma over 30 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicenter study was performed in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma who received a monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in the form of a solvent-containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with premedication for preventing an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had a compromised general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had previously received no chemotherapy, 27% had only adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only for metastasis and 19% for metastatic disease and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the overall response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving first-line therapy are outlined below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity versus paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced peripheral neuropathy degrees 3 at a time during the therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy for the decay of baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the total paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The exposure to active substance (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml, similar to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After the IV dose of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in multiphase mode.</seg>
<seg id="318">The mean distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume points to a far-reaching extravasculinary distribution and / or paclitaxel distribution.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study involving patients with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel after IV 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane were compared with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearance of paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane injection (43%) than after a solvent containing paclitaxel injection, and also the distribution volume was higher with Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers it is reported that paclitaxel is metabolized primarily to 6α -Hydroxypaclitaxel and two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma, the mean value for cumulative urinary excretion of the unchanged active substance was 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the metabolite 6α -Hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, indicating a far-reaching non-renal Clearance.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data are available to patients over the age of 75, as only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">The chemical and physical stability was proved at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected from light light over 8 hours.</seg>
<seg id="325">Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anticarcinogenic medicine and as well as other potentially toxic substances, caution should be taken when dealing with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="326">Using a sterile syringe, slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride infusion solution is injected into a Abraxane gas bottle.</seg>
<seg id="327">After complete addition of the solution, the punch bottle should rest for at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wetting of the solid material.</seg>
<seg id="328">Then the punch bottle should be swivelled and / or inverted for at least 2 minutes and / or inverted until a complete resuspation of the powder is done.</seg>
<seg id="329">In case precipitations or smells are visible, the punch bottle must be inverted gently in order to achieve a complete resuspation before use.</seg>

<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed is similar to a biological medicine approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same substance (also called "reference medicinal products").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood vessels which might occur in connection with a blood transfusion complications, if a blood donor is not possible prior to the procedure and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with seamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood donations, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be performed by the patient or his caregiver, provided that they have received appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, haemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients must be checked before the treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists, and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy or in patients with kidney problems an anaemia can be caused by an erythropoietinal deficiency or by the fact that the body does not adequately respond to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of a blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) has been introduced into which it enables epoetin alfa to be formed.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared with the reference doctor in a major study involving 479 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All participating patients had been injected Eprex / Erypo for at least eight weeks before they were either streamed or continued to get Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of the efficacy was the change in hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study where the effects of streamed traseamed with those of Eprex / Erypo were studied in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems, hemoglobin values were maintained in the same measure as those patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, the patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0,063 g / dl of the baseline value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure that can occasionally cause symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, piercing migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Unseamed should not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that it does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that for Abseamed according to the regulations of the European Union, evidence was provided that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that makes Abseamed will provide information packages for the medical specialist in all Member States, including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>

<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphomas or multiple myeloma, which receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of transfusion is due to the general state (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anemia at the onset of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">The treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate anemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8.1 mmol / l], no iron deficiency) if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, with planned major surgical procedures requiring a large volume of blood (4 or more units of blood in women; 5 or more units of blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">For the reduction of foreign blood Abseamed can be applied in front of a large elective orthopaedic intervention in adults with no iron deficiency, where high risk of fusion complications is expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml, which cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for pediatric patients in which the hemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and total disease burden; therefore, the physician's assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of illness is required.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in hemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can occasionally be observed in patients or under the hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">Given this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be used to achieve the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent hemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin-alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to make sure that epoetin alfa is used at the lowest approved dose which is required to control anemia and the symptoms of anemia.</seg>
<seg id="392">The clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance cans than patients with initial anaemia are less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.3 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance cans than patients with initial anaemia are less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week with intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.E. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms of anemia and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and total disease burden; therefore, it is necessary to assess the individual clinical course and condition of the disease by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="396">Given this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be used to achieve the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used at the lowest approved dose, which is necessary for control of the symptoms of the anemia.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 weeks of treatment of hemoglobin value increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the redemption rate of ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose of 150 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times per week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the hemoglobin increase &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the redemption rate of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl is increased compared to the initial value, the dose should be increased to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If the hemoglobin value ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the redemption rate of ≥ 40,000 cells / µl is increased three times a week after another 4 weeks of treatment, the dose of 300 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the hemoglobin value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) or the redemption rate of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, a response to epoetin-alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be terminated.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anaemia (hematokrit 33 - 39%), in which the precautionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood preserves is required, should be kept in a dose of 600 I.U. / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks before surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">Iron substitution should start as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the autologous blood donation program started so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the seamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg of epoetin alfa, which should be given once a week for three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should be given preoperatively 300 I.E. / kg on each 10 consecutive days, on the day of the surgery and 4 days immediately thereafter.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection at the end of dialysis can be given via the hose of a fistula needle followed by 10 ml isotonic saline solution to flush the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug into the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients suffering from erythroblastoma (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) under the treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive any seamed or other erythropoietin (see section 4.4 - erythroblastomenie).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within one month before treatment, instable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis (e.g. anamnestic known venous thromboembolia).</seg>
<seg id="409">For patients who are intended for larger elective orthopaedic surgery and which cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program, the use of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in the following pre-, coronary arterial disease, vascular disease of the carotides or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cerebrovascular accident.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastocystipie (PRC) Very rarely was reported on the occurrence of an anti-body mediated PRCA according to monate- to years of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of action, defined as reduction of haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased demand for transfusions, the Reticululocyte value should be determined and the common causes for non-contact (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminuminescence, infections or inflammation, blood loss and haemolysis) are investigated.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the Reticululocyte value, taking into account anaemia (i.e. the Reticululocytes Index), is degraded (&lt; 20.000 / mm3 or &lt; 20.000 / milliliter or &lt; 0.5%), the anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone marrow should be considered to diagnose a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients with a risk for an anti-body-induced PRC (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 For patients with chronic renal insufficiency, the upper limit of the hemoglobin target concentration under Section 4.2 should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials, increased risk of disease and risk for severe cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoon-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a hemoglobin target concentration of more than 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit based on the gift of epoetin if the hemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration required for control of the anaemia symptoms and the prevention of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The haemoglobin increase should be approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of increased high blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinically evident coronary heart disease or congestive insufficiency, the upper limit of the hemoglobin target concentration under Section 4.2 should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present knowledge, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are not yet dialysis, does not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">In case of tumour patients under chemotherapy, a 2 - 3-week delay between epoetin-alfa-administration and erythropoetin response should be taken into account for the assessment of the therapeutic efficiency of epoetin alfa (patients who may need to be transacted).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see Section 4.2 Treatment of Patients with chemotherapy-related anemia - dose adjustment with the aim of keeping the haemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment involving the participation of the respective patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are intended for larger elective orthopaedic surgery, the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated appropriately before the onset of epoetin-alfa therapy.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing larger elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate prevention of thrombosis because they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially with underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be ruled out that if treated with epoetin alfa for patients with an output value of &gt; 13 g / dl, there may be an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular events.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled trials, epoetins have not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anemia or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when a hemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7,5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was targeted</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporin dose can be adjusted to the rising haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies on tumor tissues, there are no indications of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF in hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">Over thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemia, cerebral ischemia, cerebral thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, retinal thromboses, retinalthromboses and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under erythropoetin therapy, so also patients under epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the worsening of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascular events (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients under treatment with erythropoetines.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of erythropoietin therapy, surgical patients with cardiovascular disease can cause thrombotic and vascular complications after repeated blood donations.</seg>
<seg id="434">The technologically recovered epoetin alfa is glycosides and is identical to the amino acids and carbohydrate content with the endogenous human erythropoetin, which was isolated from the urine of native patients.</seg>
<seg id="435">It could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa specifically stimulates erythropoesis and does not affect leukopoesis.</seg>

<seg id="438">Survival and progression of tumour were studied in five large controlled trials with a total of 2833 patients; four of these studies were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and</seg>
<seg id="439">In the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin and the patient.</seg>
<seg id="440">In these studies, patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin showed an unexplained, statistically significant higher mortality rate compared to controls due to various common malignancies.</seg>
<seg id="441">Overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thromboses and associated complications in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin and at checks.</seg>
<seg id="442">There is an increased risk of thromboembolic events in tumour patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin, and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="443">It is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the application of recombinant human erythropoetin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a haemoglobin value under 13 g / dl as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the verified data.</seg>
<seg id="444">Epoetin-alfa determinations after repeated intravenous application showed a half-life of about 4 hours in healthy subjects and a slightly prolonged half-life of about 5 hours in patients with renal insufficiency.</seg>

<seg id="537">If you suffer from erythroblastoma, it will deter your therapy with Abseamed and determine how your anaemia is best treated.</seg>
<seg id="538">Therefore, Abseamed must be given by injection into a vein (intravenously) if you are treated because of an anaemia due to kidney disease.</seg>
<seg id="539">A high haemoglobin value could be the risk of problems with the heart or the blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased.</seg>

<seg id="542">According to the present knowledge, the treatment of blood poverty with Abseamed in adults with chronic kidney failure (renal insufficiency), which is not yet dialysis, does not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="543">A 2 - 3-week delay between epoetin-alfa-administration and desired effect should be considered for assessing the effectiveness of Abseamed.</seg>
<seg id="544">200 Your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dye (haemoglobin) and adjust your seamed dose accordingly to keep the risk of blood clots (thrombotic event) as low as possible.</seg>
<seg id="545">This risk should be carefully weighed against the benefits derived from the treatment with epoetin alfa, especially if you have an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, e.g. if you are obese (obese) or if there have been thrombotic vascular events in the past (e.g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).</seg>
<seg id="546">If you are cancer patients, remember that Abseamed is like a growth factor for blood cells, and under certain circumstances the tumor may adversely affect the tumor.</seg>
<seg id="547">If you have a larger orthopedic surgery, the cause of your anaemia should be studied and treated appropriately before the start of treatment with Abseamed.</seg>
<seg id="548">If your values of the red blood dye (haemoglobin) are too high, you should not get Abseamed because there is an increased risk of blood clapping after surgery.</seg>
<seg id="549">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have / or recently used / used other medicines, even if it is not a prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="550">If you are taking Ciclosporin (agent to suppress the immune system) during your session with Abseamed, your doctor may prescribe certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="551">Laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF (G-CSF and GM-CSF are a means of building up the immune system, e.g. in cancer chemotherapy or HIV).</seg>
<seg id="552">Depending on how your anaemia responds to treatment, the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control.</seg>
<seg id="553">Your doctor will, if necessary, arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of your treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and your haemoglobin value does not exceed a certain value.</seg>
<seg id="554">Once you are well tuned, you get regular doses of Abseamed between 25 and 50 I.U. / kg twice weekly, distributed over two equally large injections.</seg>
<seg id="555">Your doctor will, if necessary, arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of your treatment and ensure that your haemoglobin value does not exceed a certain value.</seg>
<seg id="556">Depending on how the anaemia responds to the treatment, the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control.</seg>
<seg id="557">To ensure this and ensure that the hemoglobin value does not exceed a certain value, the doctor treating the hemoglobin will carry out regular blood checks.</seg>
<seg id="558">If it is necessary to shorten the treatment time before surgery, a dose of 300 I.U. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery, on day of surgery and another 4 days after surgery.</seg>
<seg id="559">However, if your doctor holds this for appropriate, you can also learn how to spray Abseamed himself under the skin.</seg>
<seg id="560">Heart, heart attack, cerebral haemorrhage, stroke, temporary circulatory disorders of the brain, deep venous thromboses, arterial thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, thromboses of the retina and blood clots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients under erythropoetin treatment.</seg>
<seg id="561">Eyelids and lips (quince edema) and shocking allergic reactions with symptoms such as tingling, redness, itching, heat feeling and accelerated pulse have been reported in rare cases.</seg>
<seg id="562">Erythroblastocystipie means that no more scarred blood cells can be formed in the bone marrow (see section "Special caution when applying seamed is required").</seg>
<seg id="563">After repeated blood donations, it can come - regardless of the treatment with Abseamed - to a blood drop formation (thrombotic vascular events).</seg>
<seg id="564">Treatment with Abseamed can be associated with increased risk of post-surgery post-surgery (post-operative thrombotic vascular events) if your output level is too high</seg>

<seg id="567">Aclasta is used to treat the following diseases: • Osteoporosis (a disease that makes the bones brittle) both in women after menopause and in men.</seg>
<seg id="568">It is used in patients with a high fracture risk (bone fractures), including those who have recently suffered a small traumatic hip fracture as in the case of hinfestation; • Morbus Paget of the bone, a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth.</seg>
<seg id="569">In addition, patients with Morbus Paget should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment; patients with hip fractures should receive a large dose of vitamin D (50 000 to 125 000 IE) orally or by injection into a muscle before the first infusion.</seg>
<seg id="570">The administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen (remedy against inflammation) shortly after the application of Aclasta can reduce the symptoms such as fever, muscle pain, flu-like symptoms, joint pain and headache.</seg>
<seg id="571">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclasta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease.</seg>
<seg id="572">As the active ingredient in Aclasta is the same as in Zometa, a part of the data material was used for the evaluation of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="573">In the first study, almost 8 000 older women with osteoporosis were involved, and the number of spinal and hip fractures was examined over a period of three years.</seg>
<seg id="574">The second study included 2 127 men and women with osteoporosis over 50 years who had recently suffered a hip fracture; the number of fractures was studied over a period of up to five years.</seg>
<seg id="575">At Morbus Paget, Aclasta was tested in two studies on a total of 357 patients and compared with Riserronat (another bisphosphonate) for six months.</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicator of the efficacy was whether the alkaline phosphatase content in serum (an enzyme that breaks bone substance) normalized in the blood or decreased at least 75% compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women, the risk of spinal fractures in patients under Aclasta (without any other osteoporosis drug) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="578">Compared to all patients under Aclasta (with or without any other osteoporosis medicine) with those under placebo the risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41%.</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study involving men and women with hip fractures 9% of the patients under Aclasta had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of the patients under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most side effects of Aclasta occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta must not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to cyoleic acid or other bisphosphonate or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, Patients with Aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to the infusion and osteonectosis (death of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The Aclasta manufacturer provides educational material for physicians to prescribe the Aclasta for the treatment of osteoporosis which contains information on how to use the medicine, as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor.</seg>

<seg id="588">Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, an intravenous infusion of 5 mg aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with low-traumatic hip fractures the administration of the infusion of Aclasta is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of hip fractures (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclasta should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After treatment of the Paget treatment with Aclasta a long remission was observed in patients who responded to therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable to provide sufficient calcium intake of calcium for at least 10 days after the application of Aclasta (see Section 4.4) for patients with Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recently developed low-traumatic hip fracture an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. oralem or intramuscular Vitamin D is recommended before the first Aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta can be reduced shortly after the application of acetamol or ibuprofen following the application of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney function disorder (see Section 4.4) For patients with a creatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended as limited clinical experience for this patient population is available.</seg>
<seg id="597">Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) are not necessary because bioavailability, distribution and elimination are similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Aclasta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age, since data for safety and effectiveness are missing.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinin-clearance &lt; 35 ml / min), as only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Pre-existing hypokalemia must be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before starting treatment with Aclasta (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Because of the rapid insertion of the effect of citric acid on bone reconstruction, a temporary, occasionally symptomatic hypokalemia may develop, whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of aclasta (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable to provide sufficient calcium intake of calcium for at least 10 days after the application of Aclasta in patients with Morbus Paget (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene should be considered to be a dental checkup with appropriate preventive dental treatment prior to use of bisphosphonates.</seg>
<seg id="604">No data is available for patients who need dental interventions, whether the interruption of treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteonectomy in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta can be reduced shortly after the application of acetamol or ibuprofen (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of atrial fibrillation reported as severe side effects was increased by patients who received Aclasta (1.3%) (51 of 3,862) compared to patients receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">The overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable in the osteoporosis studies (HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture trial [RFT]).</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse drug interactions are listed in table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Kidney function disorder was associated with renal dysfunction, which was associated with decrease in the renal function (i.e. an increase in the serum creatine) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in creatine-Clearance (measured annually prior to administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a restricted renal function were comparable in a clinical study of osteoporosis over three years between the Aclasta- and the placebo-group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatine in 10 days after administration was observed in 1.8% of patients treated with Aclasta versus 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings, the transient asymptomatic calcium levels, which were below the normal fluctuation range (less than 2.6 mmol / l), were 2.3% of patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical study compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the disease-paget studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received supplemental doses of vitamin D and calcium in the postmenopausal osteoporosis study, in the study to avoid clinical fractures after hip fractures and in the Morbus-Paget studies (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a recently developed hip fracture, the vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Aclasta (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions after the administration of Zoledronic acid in a large clinical trial was reported on local reactions at the infusion site, such as redness, swelling and / or pain, reported (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonectomy in the maxillofacial region has been treated, especially in cancer patients, about osteonecrosis (primarily in the jaw area), which were treated with bisphosphonates, including coledronacid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and the majority of reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervention.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 Patients with 7,736 patients performed osteonectomy in the jaw area of one with Aclasta and in a patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the case of overdose, which leads to clinically relevant hypokalemia, a balance can be achieved by the addition of oral calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical effectiveness in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years has been indicated with either a bone density value (BMD) -T-Score for the femoral neck ≤ -1.5 and at least two mild or moderate-heavy existing vertebral fractures or a BMD-T-Score for the femoral neck ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing vertebra fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric fluid bodies Aclasta decreased significantly over a period of three years as well as the frequency of one or more new vertebral fractures after one year (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aged 75 years and older, Aclasta treated patients with a 60% lower risk of vertebral fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclasta showed a consistent effect over three years, reduced by 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%) and reduced risk of hip fractures.</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased bone density at the lumbar vertebrate, hip, and distal radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase of bone density in the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the total hip by 6.3%, the shear-neck by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology At 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70), bone biopsies from the basin were taken one year after the third annual dose.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomography (µP) analysis showed an increase of the trabecular bone volume and the preservation of the trabecular bone architecture.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone replacement markers The bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal propeptide of the type-ion collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periods of study duration.</seg>
<seg id="630">After 12 months, the treatment with an annual 5 mg dosage Aclasta reduced significantly by 30% compared to baseline and was held at 28% below the baseline level to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the output value after 12 months and was held at 52% below the baseline value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the baseline after 12 months and was kept at 55% below the baseline value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U. orally or intramuscular) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">The total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta, compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT study, the Aclasta treatment increased in comparison to placebo-treatment the BMD at the total and Schenkelhals at all time points.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Aclasta treatment led to a 5.4% increase in BMD by 5.4% compared to placebo and 4.3% on the lower shelf.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON-RFT study, 508 men were randomized and in 185 patients the BMD was evaluated after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in men treated with Aclasta compared to 8.7% compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308), the once weekly administration of Aclasta was not inferior compared to the once weekly dose of Alendronate relative to the percentage change of the lumbar vertebra-BMD after 24 months compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical effectiveness of the treatment with the disease of the bone Paget of the bone Aclasta has been studied in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radiologically proven, especially light to moderately severe disease Paget of the bone (mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase according to the 2.5-fold age-specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg cooledronate acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of Riserronat once daily for 2 months was demonstrated in two six-month comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the baseline for Aclasta and Riserronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as Responder at the end of the six-month main study could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 patients treated with Riserronat and 107 patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response was maintained at 141 of the patients treated with Riserronat, compared to 71 patients treated with Riserronat, after 18 months follow-up.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-off and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg cooledronacid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the plasma indicator rapidly decreased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 hours, followed by a long phase very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearance from the large cycle with half-life times t ½ alpha 0,24 and t ½ β 1,87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination period t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above and ½ -values) presumably represent the rapid absorption in the bones and excretion through the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly bonded to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body-Clearance amounts to 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h, irrespective of the dose and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion-time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Zoledron-acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface below the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced clearance of metabolized substances by cytochrome-P450 enzyme systems is unlikely because coledronic acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see Section 4.2) The renal Clearance of the Zoledron acid correlated with the Kreatinin-Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatine-Clearance, and in the 64 examined patients in mean 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in an easy (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate renal dysfunction until a creatinin-clearance up to 35 ml / min does not require a dose adjustment of the Zoleironic acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">As for severe renal dysfunction (creatine-clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data are available, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-letal intravenous single dose amounted to 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and rats 0,6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">For trials on dogs, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on the AUC 6 times of the recommended human-therapeutic exposure) were administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Chronic and chronic toxicity In trials of intravenous application, the renal tolerability of Zoleironxylic acid in rats was administered by taking doses of 0.6 mg / kg as a 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose that corresponds to the 7x of the human-therapeutic exposure related to AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated exposure to accumulated expositions that exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects occurred in other organs including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, as well as at the intravenous injection site.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most frequent findings in trials with repeated use was an increased primary Spongiosa in the Metaphysis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dosages, a finding that reflects the pharmacological, anti-resorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats observed a teratogenicity in dosages of 0.2 mg / kg as outer and internal (visceral) abnormalities and such of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although maternal toxicity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of low serum calcium levels.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR to the public This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee on Medicinal Products (CHMP) evaluated the conducted studies in order to get recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). it can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially obese patients) in which metformin (a diabetes medicine) is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin in patients (especially obese patients), metformin alone cannot be sufficiently adjusted in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonyl resin or insulin, the present dose of the sulfonyl resin or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the acetate treatment except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of the sulfonyl resin or insulin is reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level drops, making type 2 diabetes more effective.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1,400 patients the efficacy of acetate was studied in tripletherapy; the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonyresin, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">This led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, suggesting that the blood sugar levels were reduced in the application of dosages of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of an additional dose of acetate for existing treatment with metformin and sulfonylharnate showed a 0.94% reduction in HbA1c, while the additional dose of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study in which the combination of acetate and insulin was examined in 289 patients, the patients receiving actos in addition to insulin had a reduction in HbA1c values from 0.69% to 6 months compared to 0.14% in patients who took placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events associated with Actos were vision disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections, weight gain and hypothetiy (reduced sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients who may react hypersensitive to pioglitazone or any of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone levels - acid levels - in blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients with metformin as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a permit to the Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited to approve the placing of an account in the entire European Union.</seg>

<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and is inappropriate for metformin due to contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For application of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are endangered by the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. earlier heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be seen in signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in heart failure reports, which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with elevated liver enzyme values (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that point to hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, Oberbauchdiscomfort, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme values must be examined.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision, whether the treatment of the patient with pioglitazone continues, should be directed to the precursor of the laboratory parameters from the clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with pioglitazone, a dose-dependent increase in weight has been proven, which can be caused by fatty deposits and in some cases linked to fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of hemodilution, a slight reduction of middle hemoglobin values (relative reduction of 4%) and hematokrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred under treatment with Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparison controlled studies with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4% and haemoglobin by 3.6-4.1%) and to a lesser extent also in patients under sulfonyharnate and insulin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 1-2% and haemoglobin by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, the risk of dose-dependent hypoglycemia is the risk of dose-dependent hypoglycemia in patients who receive pioglitazone as oral two-fold or triple-combination therapy with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch it was reported under treatment with thiazoldindia, including pioglitazone, an occurrence or worsening of diabetic macular edema with a decrease in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is not clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pioglitazone and the appearance of macular edema, but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular edema when patients report on disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events concerning fractures from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1,9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the examination of cardiovascular events, fractures of 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patients years) of patients treated with pioglitazone were treated, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes to be pregnant or who occurs, the treatment is to be deprecated (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the interactions have shown that pioglitazone does not exercise any relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with drugs metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA-reductase inhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochromium P450 2C8 inhibitor) resulted in an increase in AUC from pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with rifampicin (a cytochromium P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a reduction in AUC from Pioglitazone by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that under treatment with pioglitazone the hyperinsulin-induced hyperinsulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal are reduced, thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for the fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (cannot be estimated in this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary alteration of the Turgor and the refractive index of the lens as seen in other hypoglycaemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with pioglitazone, ALT ascents exceeded the three times the upper limit of the normal range, similar to placebo, but less frequently than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonyharnate.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease, the incidence of severe cardiac insufficiency under pioglitazone was 1.6% higher compared to placebo if pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch it has rarely been reported about heart failure under pioglitazone, but more often when pioglitazone has been used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of adverse events concerning fractures from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with pioglitazone and more than 7,400 patients were treated in groups treated with comparative medicine.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive study conducted over a period of 3.5 years, fractures of 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone were treated, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days, followed by 180 mg / day for seven days, no symptoms occurred.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone appears to work on activation of specific nuclei receptors (Peroxisome Proliferation activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), which in the animal model leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that pioglitazone reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose classification in the event of an insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical trial with pioglitazone versus glicladin as monotherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time to post the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time of two years after the beginning of the therapy, a blood glucose control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) was maintained by pioglitazone in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of the patients under Glicladin).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study of over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was inadequate with insulin for three months were randomized to pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to patients receiving insulin. a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, Pioglitazone showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin quotas compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18-week study of type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, compared to placebo, a reduction in overall plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol as well as marginally, but clinically not significantly elevated LDL- cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, pioglitazone reduced the total plasma glycerides and free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol levels compared to placebo, metformin or glicladin.</seg>
<seg id="808">In contrast to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was found under Pioglitazon, while fewer values were observed under metformin and glicladin.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a 20 week study pioglitazone not only reduced the triglyceride levels but also improved the posterior increased triglyceride level, this both through an effect on triglyceride absorption and hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 538 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomized into groups who received either Pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to the already existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular treatment.</seg>
<seg id="811">According to oral application, pioglitazone is quickly absorbed, whereby the peak concentrations of unmodified pioglitazone in plasma are normally reached 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV to efficacy is approximately three times the effectiveness of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">Interaction studies have shown that pioglitazone does not affect the pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochromium P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with rifampicin (a cytochromium P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral use of radioactively marked pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in decay (55%) and to a lesser extent in urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma phase of an immutable pioglitazone is 5-6 hours in humans, and the total active metabolites are 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of oral clearance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicology studies occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume augmentation with hemodilution, anemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that under treatment with pioglitazone the hyperinsulin-induced hyperinsulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal are reduced, thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for the fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the urinary bladder epithelium were induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP), the treatment with two other thiazoldindia led to increased frequency of colonic tumors.</seg>

<seg id="823">The calculated fracture incidence was 1,9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the examination of cardiovascular events, fractures of 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patients years) of patients treated with pioglitazone were treated, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study more than two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with pioglitazone or gliclazide have been studied.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, Pioglitazone showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinine ratio compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a 20 week study pioglitazone not only reduced fundus triglycerides but also improved the posterior increased triglyceride level, this both through an effect on tryglycerid absorption and hepatic tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was missing in respect of its primary endpoint, which presented a combination of the total mortality, non-lethal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankles, coronary reascularisation and revascularization of the leg arteries, the results suggest that the intake of pioglitazone does not involve cardiovascular long-term risks.</seg>

<seg id="876">Some patients with hypoglycemic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different than in their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before travelling over several time zones, the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such trips can lead to insulin and meals being used or taken at other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor must therefore consider possible interactions during the therapy and always ask his patients for other medicines taken by them.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 Both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, which may occur in a not sufficiently controlled diabetes care, increase the risk of abnormalities and fertility in utero.</seg>

<seg id="886">Hypoglycemia may, however, develop gradually: • Lightweight hypoglycemias can be treated with the oral intake of glucose or sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should therefore always have grape sugar, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juice. • Serious hypoglycemias involving unconsciousness are treated with an intra-muscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) or by glucose which is given intravenously by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect begins within half an hour, the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total effectiveness is up to 24 hours.</seg>

<seg id="1403">Furthermore, the results of a clinical study were submitted to 668 patients with kidney transplant, using Advagraf using Prograf / Prograft or Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1404">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplant was repelled after one year (for example by examining how often a new organ transplant or resumption of dialysis was necessary).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, shorter further studies were carried out on 119 patients with kidney transplant and 129 patients with liver transplant and examined how Advagraf is absorbed by the body compared to Prograf / Prograft.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and the treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tacrolimus this can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects, including under- or hyperimmunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; changes in the formulation or regime should only be performed under close scrutiny of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of a switch to an alternative formulation, therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and appropriate dose adjustment must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of repulsion and tolerability in individual cases and on blood-level regulations (see below "Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After conversion from Prograf to Advagraf, the Tacrolimus wall mirrors should be controlled before the changeover and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4, systemic exposure, measured as a tallow, was comparable to both niotic and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated inspections of the tacrolimus wall mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advagraf to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate transplant phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Because tacrolimus is a low-Clearance substance, an adaptation of the Advance Dosage scheme may take several days before the Steady State is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1420">Duration of the application For suppression of graft rejection, immunosuppression has to be maintained; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dosage recommendations - kidney transplant prevention of graft rejection The oral Advance therapy should start at 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dosage adjustments may be necessary later, as the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus can change in the course of the patient's stabilisation after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dosage recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral Advance therapy should start at 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendations - conversion from Prograf to Advagraf Must be converted from twice daily dose of Prograf Capsules to a once daily intake of Advagraf, this conversion has to take place in proportion 1: 1 (mg: mg), related to the entire daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">After a change from other immunosuppressants to Advagraf once a day, the treatment with the recommended oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplants must begin with the prophylaxis of graft rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplant In adult patients who are converted to Advagraf, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken once daily in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients, although there is no clinical experience with Advagraf in lung, pancreatic and intestine transplanted patients, came to an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day in treatment-transplanted patients at an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosage adjustments in special patient groups Patients with reduced liver function In order to maintain blood levels in the targeted area, a reduction of the dose may be necessary in patients with severe liver function disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since the kidney function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1430">However, due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, a careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of the serum increment levels, a calculation of the creatine-ins and a monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Switching from Ciclosporin to Advagraf When switching from a Ciclosporin to a Tacrolimus-based therapy, caution is required (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">The dose should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of repulsion and tolerability in the individual case with the use of whole blood Tacrolimus-tallow-mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent checks of the tacrolimus wall mirror during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-tallow levels of tacrolimus should also be checked after conversion from Prograf to Advagraf, dose adaptation, changes in immunosuppressive therapy or simultaneous use of substances that could alter the blood concentration of the blood (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a drug with a low clearance, adjustment of the dose may take several days until the Steady State has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">Clinical studies indicate that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood level in the blood does not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the levels of tacrolimus in the whole blood are usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and kidney - and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant receivers, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events including graft rejection or other side effects caused by tacrolimus sub- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; changes in the formulation or regime should only be performed under close scrutiny of any physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be therapisted against other immunosuppressants, there are no clinical data for the retarded formulation Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">No clinical data for the retarded formulation Advagraf is available for prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplant recipients and graft recipients in childhood.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions which may lead to a reduction of the Tacrolimus hormone in the blood and weakening the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or other plant remedies during treatment with Advagraf should be avoided (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is required, as the Tacrolimus blood levels may be subject to considerable variations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases a beta-hypertrophy referred to as cardiomyopathy was observed, which can therefore also occur under Advagraph.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, fluid overload and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the possible risk of malignant skin lesions due to appropriate clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who take Tacrolimus have symptoms for PRES such as headaches, changed states of consciousness, convulsions and blurred vision, a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>
<seg id="1449">Since Advagraf Hartblecapsules, retarded, lactose are included in patients with rare hereditary lactsis intolerance, lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose-malabsorption, special caution is required.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies, known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, can influence the metabolism of tacrolimus and consequently increase or lower the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus-blood-level with simultaneous addition of substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dosage to maintain uniform concentrations (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strong interaction with antifungal drugs such as ketoconazole, Fluconazole, Itraconazole and Voriconazole as well as with the Macromedia antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z)</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels results mainly from the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus due to the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methyl prednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4-inhibitors; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus with drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 can interfere with their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since tacrolimus can reduce the clearance of steroid contraceptives and thus can increase the exposure to hormonal exposure, decisions about contraceptive measures should be particularly cautious.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that tacrolimus potentially reduces the clearance of pentobarbital and phenazone and may prolong their half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of tests on transplant patients do not indicate that under tacrolimus, compared to other immunosuppressants, there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In utero exposure, a monitoring of the newborn is recommended for possible adverse effects of tacrolimus (especially regarding its effect on the kidneys).</seg>

<seg id="1467">It was reported on benign or malignant neoplasms including EBV- associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumours in combination with treatment with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, low water solubility and high binding of erythrocytes and plasma proteins, Tacrolimus can not be dialyzed.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The effects of tacrolimus can be mediated through its binding to a cytosolisches protein (FKBP12) which is responsible for enrichment of the connection in the cellular innaker.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciumdependent inhibition of signal transduction pathways in the T cell and thus prevents transcription of a specific set of lymphoma genes.</seg>

<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral prograf in these published studies corresponded to observations in the large studies where prograf was used in liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients for primary immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1483">In an interim analysis of a recently conducted, multicentre study with oral prograf, more than 110 patients were reported who received either tacrolimus or Ciclosporin as part of a 1: 1 randomisation.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic graft rejection, bronchiolitis of obliterate syndrome, was observed less frequently after transplantation (2.86% versus 8.57%) in the first year after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the Tacrolimus and 83% in the Ciclosporin Group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the patients treated with tacrolimus in 21,7% of cases in the development of bronchiolitis the obliterans were compared to 38.0% under Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases in which Ciclosporin had to be changed to tacrolimus (n = 0.02) was significantly greater (p = 0.02) than the number of patients who have been converted from Tacrolimus to Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there was no acute graft rejection was higher after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in the treatment-transplanted patients of the Tacrolimus group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In one study, the incidence of bronchiolitis in obliterans- syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1490">A multicentre study with oral prograf was performed to 205 patients undergoing pancreatic and kidney transplantation, which received a randomised Tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102) procedure.</seg>

<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrit and low concentrations of protein that lead to an increase in the unbound fraction of tacrolimus, or a strengthening of the metabolism caused by treatment with corticosteroids, should be responsible for the higher clearances observed after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized prior to excretion, and excretion is mainly done via bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">The systemic exposure of tacrolimus (AUC0-24) under Advagraf was approximately 10% lower compared to Prograf for stable patients (once a day) in relation to 1: 1 (mg: mg) related to the total daily dose.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hemophilia A (a congenital blood clotting disorder caused by the deficiency of Factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether it is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor of VIII deficiency, causing blood clotting problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"" "Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but is produced according to a method called" "" "recombinant DNA technology" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) has been introduced into which it enables the formation of the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Recombinate, but is made differently, so that the drug does not contain proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, including a study with 53 children under six years of age, the use of the drug was examined for the prevention of bleedings and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of Advate in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood sepepisodes with "excellent" and "good" was evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advate (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are dizziness, headaches, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">It may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human coagulation factor VIII, mouse or Hamsteroid or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Baxter AG for placing Advate on the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, on the location and the extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity in the appropriate period should not fall below the indicated plasma levels (in% of the standard or in I.E. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) repeat for 3-4 days or longer until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) repeat until the risk for the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the course of treatment the dose and frequency of injections to be administered and the frequency of injections are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in their response to factor VIII, different in vivo recovery and have different half-value times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 Prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activities are not achieved or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, a test must be performed to detect an inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitory values, it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures need to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The rate of administration should be based on the patient's condition, with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min not exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always directed against the prokoagulatory activity of factor VIII immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma by means of modified Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, while the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and an amnestic known inhibitor development, after switching from a recombinant factor VIII-product to another, the recurrence of (low-trigen) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women there are no experiences concerning the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs used in the largest number of patients were inhibitors of Factor VIII (5 patients), all with previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of inhibiting inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the sum of the individual patients (234). the unexpected waste of the blood coagulation factor VIII-Spike occurred postoperatively (10 - 14 postoperative day) in a patient under continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Blood clotting was maintained throughout the time and both the factor VIII- levels in the plasma as well as the Clearance Rate showed sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical trials with ADVATE in 145 children and adults, 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days) showed only one patient after 26 exposure days with ADVATE a low inhibitor (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach).</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, in none of the 53 pediatric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed with severe to moderate Hämophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) a FVIII inhibitor was detected after previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days).</seg>
<seg id="1562">In previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical study, 5 out of 25 (20%) treated patients treated with ADVATE were inhibitors of factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The patient's immune response to traces of contaminating proteins was analysed by investigating the antibody titers against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">One patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend and a persistent peak of the anti-CHO-cell protein level, but otherwise no signs or symptoms indicated an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">In four patients isolated cases of urticaria, pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophiles granulocytes were reported in several repeated product expositions in the study.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the first admission, the CHMP has further evaluated the benefits risk assessment, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, CHMP has decided on the basis of the ADVATE security profile, which necessitates a filing of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the authorisation holder shall apply for further extension procedures in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited announced the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the Company resigns its application for approval of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft tissues (tissues which connect, surround and support other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">It is a kind of virus that has been genetically engineered to be able to carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"" "the virus in Advexin is a" "" "Adenovirus" "", "which has been modified in such a way that there are no copies of themselves and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans." ""</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin could have been injected directly into the tumors, enabling the cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein again.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced from the p53 gene that is not defective in the human body normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and killing the cells when DNA cannot be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In the case of Li-Fraumeni Cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study involving a patient with Li-Fraumeni cancer in the area of the underbelly, in the bones and in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP has checked the answers of the company to the questions he asked, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the initial submitted documents, the CHMP builds a list of questions sent to the company on day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni-Tumore benefits for patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns regarding the treatment of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that advexin can be produced in a reliable way and that it is not harmful to the environment or for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not inform the CHMP if the withdrawal will have consequences for patients who are currently taking part in clinical studies or "comonly use" programmes with advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "changed drug release" "" "means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerobaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nasal pathways caused by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucous swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents 12 years of age, the recommended dose of aerobaze is twice daily a tablet, which should be taken with or without food in a glass of water.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are clung.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measures were the changes in the severity of the hayfever symptoms reported by the patient before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">When considering all the hay fever symptoms other than the constipation of the nose, the patients receiving aerinaze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.0% compared to 35.9% in patients receiving pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients showed a reduction of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who had lost breast cancer alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart chase), dizziness, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerobaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to loratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic agents or Loratadin (other medicines for treating allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may also not be applied to patients who suffer from narrow-angle glaucoma (elevated intraocular pressure), heart disease or vascular disease including hypertension (high blood pressure), hyperthyroidism (hyperthyrophy) or haemorrhagic stroke (stroke) or a risk of haemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for placing Aerinaze in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but can be swallowed whole (i.e. without breaking it, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years of age due to lack of data for safety and efficacy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application should be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have stopped.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days, as long-term use may decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the reduction of the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, the treatment can be continued as a monotherapy when required.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or within 2 weeks following completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combined application of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocriptin, pergolid, ganydrogotamine or other deongestiva that are peroral or nasal as swelling of rhinology (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, Naphazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy have not been tested for this patient group and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerinaze have not been tested in patients with kidney or liver function disorder and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients need to be informed that the treatment in case of hypertension or tachycardia or of palpitations, arrhythmia, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or headache) must be relieved.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertonia • Patients with a myocardial infarction in anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, blister obstruction or bronchospasm in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is to be deprecated at least 48 hours before dermatological tests, since antihistaminika otherwise can prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the course of clinical trials with desloratadin, where erythromycin or ketoconazole was administered in addition, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in plasma concentrations of the patients were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychomotor tests, no significant differences could be found between the patients treated with placebo and the patients treated with placebo, regardless of whether or not desloratadin was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other drugs cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">In vivo CYP3A4 does not inhibit desloratadin, and in vitro studies have shown that the CYP2D6 drug is not inhibiting and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the application of aerinaze during pregnancy is not guaranteed, but experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, did not result in an increase in the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency in the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">As reproductive studies on animals cannot always be transmitted to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be applied during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, the patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may come to a stupor which may result in an impairment of the transport capability or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a CNS-depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible Latvian courses.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, aggravating miction, muscular weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, breathing insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmia, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, preventive pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, blurred vision, hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropine-typical symptoms (mouth-drying, pupil starre and - dilatation, redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophils as well as inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P-selector on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, desulatadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance, including amplification of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, the recommended dosage of 5 mg. daily did not detect an increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further symptomimetic effects such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestations of CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients between the ages of 12 and 78 took part in the seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine antagonistic efficacy of aerinaze tablets was significantly higher compared to monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined on the basis of the nasal mucosa swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of aerobic tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnicity affiliation.</seg>
<seg id="1697">In the course of a single dose study for pharmacokinetics of aerinaze, desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes of dosing in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aero-aze in healthy subjects over 14 days, the flow equilibrium of lost veins, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the course of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study carried out with the formulation as a tablet on healthy adult subjects, it was found that four test subjects were poorly metabolised.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (CMAx and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the exclusive application of pseudoephedrine is equivalent to exposure to an aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on the conventional studies of safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated administration, gene toxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with desloratadin does not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies the combination of Loratadin / pseudoephedrine in oral doses of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day was not teratogenic.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and pharmacovigilance system described in Module 1.8.1 of the application for authorisation is and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to the relief of the allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's own substance, its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), such as sneezing, running or itching nose and tearing or itching eyes while constipating the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Tell your doctor if you experience or diagnose the following symptoms or illnesses under the use of aerinaze: • High blood pressure • Heart chase, palpitations, heart rhythm disorders • nausea and headaches, or intensification of existing headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1710">If you are taking Aerinaze with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not a prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Transport and operation of machinery When used in the recommended dosage, it is not to be expected that aerinaze leads to dizziness or reduces the attention.</seg>
<seg id="1712">If you have taken a larger amount of aerinaze than you should immediately inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken a larger amount of aerinaze than you should.</seg>
<seg id="1713">If you miss taking Aerinaze if you forgot to take a dose in time, take the dose as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time.</seg>
<seg id="1714">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this use information.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Heart chase, restlessness with increased physical activity, mouth-drying, dizziness, sore throat, loss of appetite, constipation, sugar in urine, increased blood sugar levels, thirst, fatigue, headache, sleep disorders, nervousness, and dizziness.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the market launch of Desloratadin, very rarely has been reported on cases of severe allergic reactions (shortness of breath, whistling breathing, itching, hives and swelling) or skin rash.</seg>
<seg id="1718">Cases of heart palpitations, heart chase, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, dizziness, restlessness with increased physical activity, over cases of liver inflammation and cases of conspicuous liver failure were also very rare reported.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as a 5 mg tablet, 5 mg lyophilisate for taking (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg / ml and 5 mg melt tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1,25 mg once a day, which is in the form of 2.5 ml syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies of seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies of patients who had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by identifying the symptoms (itching, the number and size of the quadricots, impairment of sleep and performance on the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted to prove that the body uses the syrup, the solution to take in and the processed tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius showed an average decrease in symptom scores by 25 to 32% compared to a decrease of 12 to 26% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In both studies in Urticaria, the decrease in symptom scores was 58 and 67% after six weeks of treatment, compared to 40 and 33% compared to placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to loratadin, Loratadin or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for placing Aerius in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once daily, with or without a meal, to relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persisting allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of loratadin in young people aged 12 to 17 (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (onset of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be done according to the current illness and can be terminated following the end of the symptoms and can be resumed at their reoccurring.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In case of persisting allergic rhinitis (onset of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks), a prolonged treatment may be recommended to patients during the time of allergy.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with desloratadin tablets in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered in addition (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, the patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may come to light that may result in a disturbance of the transport capability or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported in patients with Aerius daily at the recommended dose of 5 mg versus patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo were fatigue (1.2%), mouth dry (0.8%) and headaches (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">A clinical trial with 578 adolescent patients aged 12 to 17 was the most frequent side effect of headaches, which was diagnosed in 5.9% of patients treated with chloratadin and 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study involving up to 45 mg of desulatadin (nine times a clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophils as well as inhibition of the adhesion of the adhesion molecules P-selector to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses that were administered at a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in which chloramatadin was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily (twice the clinical dose) over ten days, there was no prolongation of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance, including amplification of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in relieving symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tears of tears, and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis may be classified depending on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in intermittent allergic rhinitis and persisting allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the onset of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persisting allergic rhinitis is defined as the onset of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As demonstrated by the overall survival of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was investigated for further forms of urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology, irrespective of etiology, is similar to the different forms and chronic patients can be easily recruited prospectively.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the history of histamines is a causative factor in all urticaria diseases, it is expected that in other forms of urticaria, desloratadin will also lead to an improvement in symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with Chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and the reduction of size and number of nodles at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the majority of patients who did not respond to antihistaminika were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement of the itching rate by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with disloratadin compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and alertness, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, in which patients were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients had a higher concentration of lost patients.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There is no indication of clinically relevant cumulation after once daily use of loratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolisms of Desloratadin has not yet been identified, so interactions with other medicines are not completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1758">In-vivo Desloratadin does not inhibit CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the CYP2D6 drug is not inhibiting and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with desloratadin in a dosage of 7.5 mg meals (fatty, calorie-rich breakfast) did not affect the availability of loratadin.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of meals to relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persisting allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing physician should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and there is no data available to support an infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical anomalies, anamnesis, physical examination and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between the ages of 2 and 11 have been metabolised to the loratadin and experienced higher endurance (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children from 2 to 11 years, which is more restricted, is identical to that of children that metabolize normal.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore, patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose absorption or sucrose-Isomaltase- insufficiency should not take this medicine.</seg>

<seg id="1770">In a clinical pharmacological study, the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius tablets and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall frequency of adverse events in children aged between 2 and 11 was similar to the placebo group in the Aerius syrup group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in different indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, the recommended dose reported 3% more adverse events in patients with Aerius than those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study involving adult and adolescent patients with up to 45 mg of desulatadin (nine times a clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children between the ages of 1 and 11 who were eligible for antihistamine therapy received a daily total dose of 1.25 mg (between 1 and 5 years old) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of orphatadin in adults and children are similar, the efficacy data of orphatadin in adults can be extrapolated to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">In the course of a clinical trial with multiple doses of adults and adolescents in which chloramatadin was used for 14 days in a dose of up to 20 mg, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>

<seg id="1781">In adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in relieving symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tears of tears, and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As demonstrated by the overall survival of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius tablets effectively reduce the effects caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with Chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and the reduction of size and number of nodles at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this restricting metabolizing phenotype was similar to adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations larger in blacks (18% adults, 16% children) than with Caucasians (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study with the syrup formulation of children between the ages of 2 and 11 with allergic rhinitis, which can be metabolized.</seg>

<seg id="1893">In June 2008, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. acknowledged the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the Company resigns its application for the introduction of Aflunov on the prevention of aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influenza caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic occurs when a new trunk of the flu virus occurs, which can easily spread from man to person, because humans have not built up immunity (no protection).</seg>
<seg id="1897">Once the vaccine is administered, the immune system recognises the parts of the influenza virus contained in the vaccine as "foreign" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">This makes the immune system later able to form antibodies faster in contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane shell of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which the human body recognises as foreign), was purified and used as a constituent of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">An inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of the clinical data base for assessing the safety of the vaccine was insufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for pre-pandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">If you are taking part in a clinical trial and require further information on your treatment, please contact your attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you would like further information regarding the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years, which are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution, but this cannot be taken together with ritonavir since the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Asgenerase should only be prescribed when the doctor has checked which antiviral drug the patient has previously taken, and the likelihood of the virus to respond to the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which is taken together with twice daily 100 mg ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between the ages of 4 and 12 and for patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of aggregation according to body weight is directed.</seg>
<seg id="1909">When used in combination with other antiviral medicines, Agenerase decreases the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Not to cure AIDS, however, can delay the damage to the immune system and hence the development of AIDS-related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was investigated in combination with other antiviral drugs, but without ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The drug, with low dosed ritonavir, was compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who previously took protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change in the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously not taken protease inhibitors, more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml compared to placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced the viral load, but only very few responded to the treatment by the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the trial with adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the viral load reinforced with ritonavir lowered the viral load as effectively as other protease inhibitors after 16 weeks of treatment:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, Agenerase came together with ritonavir for a more severe drop in the viral load after four weeks compared to the patients receiving their former protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Avalase (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (flatulence), nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amprenavir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Asgenerase may also not be applied to patients who take St. John's wort (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or medicines which are degraded just like Agenerase and are health-damaging in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, patients who take aggregation are the risk of a lipid rophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteoarthritis (death of bone tissue) or an immune activation syndrome (symptoms of an infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of aggregation in use in combination with other antiretroviral medicines used to treat HIV-1 infected adults and children outweigh the risks over four years.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic reinforcer Ritonavir, but the committee found that the benefit of aggregation in combination with ritonavir in patients who had previously not taken protease inhibitors is not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally admitted under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Glaxo Group Limited for the transport of aggregation in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) -treated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually Agenerase capsules should be administered for pharmacokinetic boosters of amprenavir along with low doses of ritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amprenavir should be performed taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pretreatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% lower than from amprenavir as a capsule; therefore, aspirin capsules and solution to intake on a milligram per milligram base are not replaceable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Avalase capsules is 600 mg amprenavir twice daily along with 100 mg ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the addition of ritonavir (booster), higher doses of aggregation (1200 mg twice a day) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for aspirin capsules is 20 mg amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of aggregation in combination with low doses of ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to lack of data for safety and efficacy (see paragraph 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be carried out in patients with mild or moderate liver function disorder with caution; in patients with severe liver function disorder, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Asgenerase must not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and can also display substrates of the cytochrome P450-isotherenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of amprenavir while taking amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The present antiretroviral therapy, including treatment with Agenerase, does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, Agenerase capsules should be used together with low doses of ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver side effects with potentially fatal disease.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant specialist information of these medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing reduced liver function including chronic-active hepatitis show an increased incidence of liver function disorders under antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Agenerase and ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolised via CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including Morbus Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, simultaneous administration of astatin with lovastatin and simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including Rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under surveillance of the International Norised Ratio), methods for determining the drug concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients taking this medicine at the same time, Agenerase may be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Because of the possibility of metabolic interactions with amprenavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives may be altered, but the information is insufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with amprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored on oppendiment symptoms, especially if low doses of ritonavir can be administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the possible risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycoence of the Agenerase solution, this dosage form is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Asgenerase should be set to 5 in duration if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases in which drugs were necessary to be associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and associated with drug dependent factors, such as prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hemophilic patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors reports of an increase in hemorrhage including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and haemarthrosis are reported.</seg>
<seg id="1957">At the time of initiating antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), HIV-infected patients may develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections that lead to severe clinical conditions or worsening symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although multifactorial etiology is assumed (including use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonectomy were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV-disease and / or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 submediums with inferior therapeutic width Agenerase may not be given simultaneously with drugs that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cytochrome P450-isotherenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6-mediums with inferior therapeutic width aggregation with ritonavir must not be given together with medicines whose active ingredients are metabolised primarily by CYP2D6 and are associated with increased plasma levels with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It was shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of amprenavir which can lead to a virological failure and a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to compensate the degraded plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with ritonavir, adverse events were often observed in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of amprenavir can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already takes St. John's wort, the amprenavirus level and, if possible, check the viral load and depose the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not necessary when nelfinavir is given together with amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased, compared to CMAx by 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg amprenavir were applied twice daily and ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment plan.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower if amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of amprenavir in plasma, which were achieved twice daily in combination of amprenavir (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, but strict monitoring is recommended, as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacokinetic study was carried out in combination with didanosine in combination with didanosine, but due to the inventive component of didanosine it is recommended that the revenues of didanoin and asgenerase are at least one hour apart (see the antacid below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) there is no dose adjustment required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as exposure of both protease inhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of nevirapine on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that nevirapine may lower the serum concentration of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these medicines should be used at the same time, caution is advised, as Delavirdin could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these medicines are used together, caution is required; thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be made, as precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of amprenavir and rifabutin led to a rise in plasma concentrations (AUC) by Rifabutin by 193%, resulting in a rise in side-effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin together with Agenerase, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin is recommended at least half of the recommended dose, although there are no clinical data.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with aserase in combination with erythromycin were not performed, but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fosamprenavir and 100 mg ritonavir with 200 mg ketoconazole once daily led to an increase in the CMAx of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to the 2,69ple compared to the value that was observed once daily with ketoconazole without simultaneous application of Fosamprenavir with ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below including mediums, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can potentially interact when applied together with aggregation.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with aggregation.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors, it is advisable that antacids are not taken at the same time as aggregation, as it may cause resorption faults.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anticonvulsants known as enzyme inductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amprenavir, can lead to a decrease in the plasma concentration of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipine, Diltiazem, Felodipine, Israelipine, Nisoldipine and Verapamil can be increased by 10 amprenavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of these medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The simultaneous intake of Avalase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and intensify with PDE5 inhibitors associated with side effects including hypotension, visual disturbances and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study where Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily together with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of test subjects, the Fluticasonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous gift of Agenerase with Ritonavir is not recommended along with these glucocorticoids unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroidal effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">For HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, pronounced increases in plasma levels can be expected while administration of Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma level increases of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy, including a rhubdomyolysis, the combined use of these drugs with amprenavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">More frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations until stabilising the mirror is recommended, as the plasma concentrations of Cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased with simultaneous injection of amprenavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, asgenerase should not be applied along with Midazolam taken orally (see section 4.3) while with simultaneous use of aggregation with parenteral midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for the simultaneous application of parenteral midazolam with other proteaseinase inhibitors point to a possible increase in plasma gas of Midazolam around 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is given together with amprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored on oppiate symptoms, especially if low doses of ritonavir can be administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historical comparisons, there is currently no recommendation of how to adjust the amprenavirus dosage, if amprenavir is administered simultaneously with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With simultaneous administration of Warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with Agenerase, increased control of the INR (International Norised Ratio) is recommended due to the possibility of weakening or strengthening of the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, so alternative methods for contraception are also recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended in the simultaneous administration of aggregation (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This medicine may be used during pregnancy only after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">Amprenavir-related substances have been detected in the milk of lactation-related rats, but it is not known whether amprenavir is transferred to breast milk in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of gravid rats, which was administered from the inhibition in the uterus to the end of the lactation amprenavir, showed a diminished increase in the 12 body weight during lactation.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of offspring, including fertility and reproductive capacity, was not affected by the administration of amprenavir to the mother animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The safety of Agenerase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the Agenerase treatment were mild to moderate, occurred early and rarely led to the treatment interruption.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events are not clarified if they are related to the use of Agenerase or any other medicine used for HIV treatment, or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects listed below are from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients with protease inhibitors received 1200 mg of Avalase twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), evaluated by investigators as in connection with study medication and performed in more than 1% of the patients, as well as laboratory changes occurring in the course of treatment (Grade 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with a redistribution of the body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and fat subcutaneous fatty tissue, increased intra-abdominal and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsocervical fat accumulation (stem cells).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretroviral non-treated persons treated with amprenavir in combination with lamivudine / Zidovudine over a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case (stem cells) (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006 with 245 NRTI- pre-treated patients under amprenavir 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients under indinavir, in combination with different NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Rashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or makulocuous nature, with or without itching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with amprenavir had to be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteonectomy were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV-disease or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">At the time of initiating antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), HIV-infected patients may develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">In PI pre-treated patients who received 600 mg of Avalase twice a day along with low dose Ritonavir (Grade 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4) were similar to those observed under general aggregation treatment (Grade 3 and 4), which occurred in patients who received aphorase along with low dosed Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdose, the patient is to be observed on signs of an intoxication (see section 4.8), if necessary, to initiate necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active center of the HIV-1 protease and thus prevents the processing of viral gag- and gag-pol- polyproteinstages with the consequence of a formation of unripe, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB has been studied both in acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% hemmRNA concentration (IC50) of amprenavir is located in the range between 0.012 and 0.08 µM in the case of acutely infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in the case of chronically infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of amprenavir versus HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral, non-treated patients with the currently approved endosamprenavir / ritonavir dosage, the mutations described in other Ritonavir were rarely observed with proteaseinase inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral, non-treated patients who received 700mg of Fosamprenavir with 100mg ritonavir twice daily in the study ESS100732, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, with 14 isolates genotypically studied.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypic analysis of the isolate of 13 out of 14 children in which a virological failure occurred within the 59 patients with protease inhibitors showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V36I, M46I / L, I47V, D60E, I62V, A71V, V77I, V82A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its prolongation APV30005 (700 mg Fosamprenavir / 100 mg ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) patients treated with protease inhibitors occurred in patients with virological failure over 96 weeks, following protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypic resistance test-based analysis of genotypic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of amprenavir / ritonavir or fosamprenavir / ritonavir in patients with proteasthenol-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / kritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, I62V, V82A / C / F / G, I84V and L90M in conjunction with an increased phenotypic resistance on fosamprenavir with ritonavir as well as a reduced probability of virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns can be subject to changes by additional data, and it is recommended to always approach the current interpretation systems for analysing the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on phenotypic resistance testing clinically validated phenotypic interpretation systems can be used in combination with the genotypic data to estimate the activity of amprenavir / ritonavir or fosamprenavir / ritonavir in patients with proteasunder-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that market diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically-phenotypic cut-offs for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to amprenavir associated genetic samples generates a certain degree of resistance against ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on resistance between amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance pathways, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on twenty-five antiretroviral and non-treated patients (one of which demonstrated resistance to Lopinavir and saquinavir) and another against tipranavir (one of 25 isolates), indinavir / ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), indinavir / ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), saquinavir (three from 24 isolates) and Tidenavir / ritonavir (four of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">On the other hand, amprenavir retains its activity against some other protease inhibitors-resistant isolates; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The early departure of a failing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations within limits that can adversely affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the efficacy of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study involving PI pretreated adults following virological failure (100 mg twice daily) and nucleoside aloga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with low-dosed Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI have been included in the substudy A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis showed the non-inferiority of APV / ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group in the viral load (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-leaking shaft of 0,4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of unbleached aggregation is based on two uncontrolled trials involving 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of whom 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase solution for taking and capsules in dosages of 15 mg / kg was tested three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dosed ritonavir at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks approximately 25% of the patients enrolled in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml with a median increase in the CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the baseline.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "19 Based on this data, the benefit of" "" "unbleached" "" "aggregation should be considered in therapy optimisation with PI pre-treated children." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">According to oral administration, the average duration (Tmax) amounts to the maximum Serum concentration of amprenavir approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">50% increased, by contrast, reduced by 30% for CMAx, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by the intake of food, although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and leaves a large distribution volume as well as an unhindered penetration of amprenavir from the blood circulation into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in plasma, whereby the amount of unbound amprenavir which represents the active part remains probably unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active components fluctuates throughout the dosing interval depending on the total drug concentrations in the Steady State over the range of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>

<seg id="2077">In a clinical study where Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily together with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of test subjects, the Fluticasonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">With simultaneous administration of Warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with Agenerase, increased control of the INR (International Norised Ratio) is recommended due to the possibility of weakening or strengthening of the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">Simultaneous administration of ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0.035 mg of ethinyl stradiol plus 1,0 mg Norethindron) led to a decrease in the AUC and Cmin from amprenavir by 22% respectively.</seg>

<seg id="2203">There are only very limited data on the use of imiquimod for the treatment of actinic keratoses in anatomical places outside the face and scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on the actinic keratose on the forearms and hands do not support the effectiveness of this application, so such an application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions often occur, but these reactions usually decrease in intensity in the course of therapy or go back after the onset of therapy with Imiquimod creams.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions cause great discomfort to the patient or are very strong, the treatment may be suspended for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Data from an open clinical study showed that patients with more than 8 patients had a lower overall healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Because of the immune-stimulating properties, Imiquimod cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">Animal studies do not cause direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although non-recurring serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) were not quantifiable after several times of topical use, no recommendation can be given to the application during the lactation period.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most frequent contributors and possibly or possibly with the application of Imiquimod-cream related side-effects in studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of the hands (33.7% of patients treated with imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2212">The most common reported and possibly or possibly with the application of the Imiquimod-cream related side-effects include discomfort on the application site with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The basalioma patients treated with Imiquimod-cream from a placebo-controlled phase III clinical study reported side effects are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common adverse event, probably or possibly associated with Imiquimod's application, were in these studies a reaction to the application site (22% of patients treated with imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The side effects reported by 252 in placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trials with Imiquimodine treated patients with actinic keratose are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">This review of the clinical signs foreseen by the protocol shows that placebo-controlled clinical studies with Imiquimod-creme frequently lead to local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), excoriation / dipping / shed (23%), edema (14%) (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">This evaluation of the clinical signs indicated according to the test plan shows that in these studies, five times weekly treatment with Imiquimod-creme frequently resulted in severe erythema (31%), severe erosions (13%), and severe tumour formation and calcification (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials evaluating the use of imiquimod for treatment of actinic keratose, alopecia was determined with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The inadvertent one-time oral absorption of 200 mg of imiquimod, which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically serious side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, was in hypotony that normalized according to oral or intravenous fluids.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic study systemic concentrations of alpha interferon and other cytokines were detected after topical application of imiquimodine.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal phase 3 efficacy studies it could be shown that the efficacy in the case of a complete recovery of the clinometers at an Imiquimod treatment over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment is clearly superior.</seg>
<seg id="2223">60% of patients treated with Imiquimod totally healed the patients; this was the case at 20% of the patients who had treated placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 male patients treated with Imiquimod, compared to 5% of 161 with placebo-treated male patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of imiquimod with five-week use per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary supermodial basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data presented in an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years show that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%) of all treated patients were clinically cured and that remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of Imiquimod with three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free period, was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, invisible, discrete, non-hypertrophic, non-hypertrophic human lesions within a contiguous 25 cm2 area of treatment on the scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The two-year data from two combined monitoring studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications of external clinometers, actinic keratose and super-artificial basal cell carcinoma do not usually occur in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Cream was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled studies on children between the ages of 2 and 15 with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">In these studies the efficacy of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or less).</seg>
<seg id="2234">Minimal systemic intake of the 5% imiquimod cream through the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratose was observed during the three weekly use during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drug concentrations in the serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and betrugen 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The estimated half-life time was about 10 times higher than the 2-hour half-life after the subcutaneous use in a previous study; this indicates prolonged retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Systemic exposure data showed that the absorption of imiquimod to topical application on MC-sick skin of 6 - 12 years was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with actinic keratose or superficial basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study of dermal toxicity in rats, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of kg lead to significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; a study carried out for four months for the dermal application did not reveal any similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study of carcinogenicity in mice in mice on three days a week did not induce tumours in the application center.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The appropriate mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutable, a risk for man due to systemic exposure may be regarded as very low.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active free cream earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with inferior UVR.</seg>
<seg id="2242">It may harm other people, even though they have the same symptoms as you. − If any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this use information, please inform your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2243">● Feignizen (Condylomata acuminata) formed on the skin in the area of genitals (sexual organs) and anus (anus) ● superficial basal cell carcinoma This is a frequently encountered, slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spread to other parts of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If left untreated, it can lead to distortions, especially in the face - so early detection and treatment is important.</seg>
<seg id="2245">Actinic keratoses are rough areas of the skin that occur in people who have been exposed to sunlight during their previous life.</seg>
<seg id="2246">Aldara should only be applied with flat actinic keratoses on the face and scalp in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Aldara is the most suitable treatment for you.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Aldara Cream supports your body's immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body to combat the superficial basal cell carcinoma, the actinic keratose or the virus responsible for the infection.</seg>

<seg id="2254">If you have intercourse with genital warts in the genital area, the treatment with Aldara cream after sexual intercourse (not before) is to perform.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have used other medicines or have recently applied, even if it is not a prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2256">Do not breastfeed your baby during treatment with Aldara Cream as it is not known if Imiquimod passes into breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2257">The frequency and duration of treatment are different in case of feignices, basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratose (refer to specific instructions for each application area).</seg>
<seg id="2258">Apply a thin layer of Aldara cream to clean, dry skin with the hands and rub the cream carefully on the skin until the cream is completely absorbed.</seg>
<seg id="2259">Men with feignies under the foreskin must withdraw the foreskin every day and wash the skin area underneath (see section 2 "What do you need to consider before applying Aldara cream?").</seg>
<seg id="2260">Please talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have the impression that the effect of aldara is too strong or too weak.</seg>
<seg id="2261">For 6 weeks, apply a sufficient amount of Aldara cream for 5 days a week to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area.</seg>

<seg id="2265">A low blood cell count may make you susceptible to infections; it can cause you to develop a blue stain faster or cause fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this use information.</seg>
<seg id="2267">In addition, you can feel itching (32% of the patients), burning (26% of the patients) or pain in the areas on which you have applied Aldara cream (8% of the patients).</seg>
<seg id="2268">In most cases, it is easier skin reactions that return within approximately 2 weeks after the treatment has been completed.</seg>
<seg id="2269">Occasionally, some patients notice changes in the application location (wound secretions, inflammation, swelling, tumour formation, skin rash, blisters, dermatitis) or irritability, nausea, dry mouth, flu-like symptoms and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2270">Occasionally, some patients suffer from changes in the application location (bleeding, inflammation, wound secretion, ulceration, heat-feeling or discomfort), inflammation of the nasal mucosa, clogged nose, flu or flu-like symptoms, neck pain, diarrhea, actinic keratose, redness, face swelling, sores, body aches, fever, weakness or shivers.</seg>
<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (symptoms which are not related to brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not broken down and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints that complicate movements, decreased lung volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should be administered in a hospital or clinic with revitalizing devices, and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study mainly examined the safety of the drug, but it was also measured by its effectiveness (by investigating its effect on the reduction of GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years, Aldurazyme lowered the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the children treated showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), arthralgia (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat feeling, fever and reactions to the infusion site.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years of age are elevated blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and shivers.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review all new information that may be known each year and, where necessary, update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will observe patients receiving Aldurazyme regarding the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted Genzyme Europe B.V. a permit to transport Aldurazyme across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of the human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammalian cell cultures (Chinese hamster ovary, ovarian of Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or hepatic insufficiency was not determined, and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme may develop infusion-related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion-day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment where revitalization devices for medical emergencies are available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the phase III clinical trial, nearly all patients are IgG antibodies against laronidase, usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reactions must be treated with caution when using Aldurazyme (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience regarding resumption of the treatment after a longer break, the risk of hypersensitivity reactions after an interruption of treatment has to be cautiously avoided due to the theoretically increased risk of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of infusion with medicines (antihistamines and / or anti-pyrees) to minimize the potential incidence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a mild or moderate infusion-related reaction, the treatment should be contemplated with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or a reduction of the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the case of a single, severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">The infusion can be resumed with a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate at which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquine or procain because there is a potential risk of interferenz with the intracellular absorption of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not include direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, fetal embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data on newborns exposed to laronidase over breast milk are present, it is recommended not to breastfeed during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were primarily classified as infusion-related reactions which were observed in 53% of the patients in the Phase 3 study (duration of treatment of up to 4 years) and 35% of the patients in the study with participants under 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions related to alloazyme observed during the Phase III study and their prolongation in 45 patients aged 5 or older are listed in the following table according to the following frequency: very common (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in prehistory, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospasm, respiratory stall and facial oil (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted drug interactions with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a Phase- 2 study involving a total of 20 patients under 5 years of age, with predominantly severe trial form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 I / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 I / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most patients underwent a serum conversion within 3 months from the onset of treatment, with a more severe form of recurrence in patients under the age of 5 (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the Phase 3 study (resp. to a premature excretory from the study), no antibodies that were detectable by radioimmunophenciitation (RIP) assay were present in 13 / 45 patients, among them 3 patients who had never had a serum conversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with low antibody levels showed a robust lowering of the GAG mirror in urine, while a variable reduction of GAG in urine was found in patients with high antibody titers.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic laronidal activity in vitro which did not seem to impair the clinical efficacy and / or decrease of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies seemed not to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions, although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The justification for the therapy of the enzyme is one of the hydrolysis of the accumulating substratum and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After IV infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from the circulation and taken up by cells into the Lysosomes, most likely via mancan-6 phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients between 6 and 43 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study that showed the entire disease spectrum, the majority of patients were from the middle phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FeV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the efficacy were the percentage change in the expected FeV and the absolute distance in the 6 minute audible test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazyme for another 3,5 years (182 weeks) each week.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Aldurazyme showed an improvement in lung function and the ability to walk, which is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / althazyme group, as shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FeV has not been clinically significant over this period and absolute lung volumes increased proportionally to the body size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a hepatomegaly before treatment 22 (85%) reached normal liver size by the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a clear drop in the GAG mirrors was found in urine (µg / mg creatinine), which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In regard to the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients, which was taken into account by the use of a combined endpoint, which summarizes clinically significant changes across five efficacy variables (expected percentage of normal feed, range of shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), there was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was conducted, in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were investigated in 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion (16 patients with severe form and 4 with the mean follow-up form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased Gag- Mirror in Harn in week 22 in the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) were determined according to the Z-score for this age group The younger patients with the severe trial form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed a normal mental development speed, whereas in older patients with difficult lead-form only limited or no progress in cognitive development was to be determined.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, investigations on pharmacodynamic effects of various aldurazyme dosing schemes were carried out on the GAG mirror in urine, liver volume and 6-minute walk-test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 I / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 I / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">Dosing scheme with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative for patients experiencing difficulty with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacokinetic profile of patients under the age of 5 was similar to that of older and less severely affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in a unique dose, toxicity with repeated dose and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data do not reveal any particular danger to man.</seg>

<seg id="2353">Preparation of the Aldurazyme infusion (using aseptic technique) • For the body weight of the individual patient, first determine the number of thinners to be diluted.</seg>
<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with cisplatin (another drug for cancer) in patients who have not received chemotherapy (anti-cancer drugs) and "maligne" (malignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body or is probably slightly spread to other parts of the body).</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used as the sole therapy in patients who have not previously been treated in combination with cisplatin and in patients who previously received other chemotherapies.</seg>
<seg id="2356">To reduce side effects, the patients should have a corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) during treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, an antiemetic drug (remedy against vomiting) and liquids (in order to prevent liquid deficiency) should be given before or after the dose of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood is changed or certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed, deactivated or the dose should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of pemetrexed thus slows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of pemetrexed into its active form proceeds more easily in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active effect in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant pleural endothelioma, Alimta was examined in a main study involving 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy against their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease, previously treated with chemotherapy, were compared to the effects of docetaxel (another drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">In addition, Alimta was compared to gemcitabine (another cancer drug), both in combination with cisplatin in 1 725 patients who previously had no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin showed an average of 12.1 months compared to 9.3 months in the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time with Alimta was 8.3 months, compared to 7.9 months with docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients with whom cancer did not attack the squamous cell proliferation in the administration of Alimta showed longer survival rates than with the comparable medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. for the transport of Alimta across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each water bottle must be dissolved with a 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the penetration block and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride-injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is indicated in combination with cisplatin for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, except for predominant plate epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for the treatment in second-line treatment of patients with lo-, advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma, except for predominant plate epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface area (KOF) is administered as an intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as infusion for a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the pemetrexed- infusion on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered as an intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">To reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid must be given on the day before and on the day of the mixed-fruit and on the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of pemetrexed, at least 5 doses of folic acid have to be taken and the intake must continue throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last Pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients must also receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) a week before the first mixed dose and after each third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving pemetrexed, a complete blood count should be created before each application, including a differentiation of the leukocytes and a platelet census.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and Alanine transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose examination must take place taking account of the Nadirs of the blood image or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of the early therapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After the recovery, patients have to be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are used for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC Grade 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients develop non-hematological toxicity ≥ Grade 3 (excluding neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient receives the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA has to be canceled if a haematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity of 3 or 4 or 4 neurotoxicity occurs in patients after 2 dose reductions.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that at the age of 65, a higher secondary effect risk exists in patients between 65 and 65 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to inadequate data for safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, no dose adjustment was necessary in patients with a creatinin-clearance ≥ 45 ml / min, which go beyond the dosage adjustments recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatinin-clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with liver function restriction of &gt; 1.5 times the upper bilirubin- limit and / or transaminase values of &gt; the 3,0-fold of the upper limit value (if liver metastases) were not studied especially in studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with respect to bone and pemetrexed should not be given to patients before their absolute number of neutrophils again reaches ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombo- cyte number again reaches a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrophine number, platelet count and maximal non-haematological toxicity as observed in the preceding treatment courses (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of 3 / 4 haematological and non-haematological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neutropenia was observed when pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with pemetrexed need to be instructed to apply folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid simultaneous consumption of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsali- cylacid (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days after therapy with pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients with pemetrexed therapy must avoid taking NSAIDs with long half-life for at least 5 days before the therapy, day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in which these events occurred had relevant risk factors for the appearance of renal events including dehydration, high blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, a drainage of the effusion should be considered in patients with clinically significant fluid accumulation in the transcellular space prior to pemetrexed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 Major cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with pemetrexed, if this substance was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous use of attenuated live vaccine (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of irreversibly damaging the reproductive ability through pemetrexed, men should be advised before the treatment regimen to obtain advice regarding sperm conservation.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (creatinin-clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage (≥ 1.3 g daily) may result in reduced pemetrexed precipitation resulting in increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">It is therefore advisable to use high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid in high doses in patients with normal kidney function (creatinin-clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">(ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy, be avoided at least 2 days after therapy with pemetrexed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there is no data regarding the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-life such as piroxicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application with pemetrexed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy, at least 2 days after the therapy with pemetre- xed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the INR (International Norised Ratio) when the decision was taken to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of pemetrexed in pregnant women, but as with antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected in the case of an application in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed should not be applied during pregnancy, except if absolutely necessary and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversibly damaging the reproductive ability through pemetrexed, men should be advised before the start of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the blocking of sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether pemetrexed is transferred into the mother's milk and unwanted effects on the breast-fed baby can not be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma and the randomized cisplatin and pemetrexed and 163 patients with mesothelioma who randomized cisplatin as monotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetrexed) is an antiineoplastic antifreeze which exerts its effect by interrupting weight-dependent metabolic processes that are necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that pemetrexed acts as an antifungal with multiple attack points by blocking the thyme deduction (TS), Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and Glycinamidribonucleotidfor- myltransferase (GARFT), which are folate-dependent enzymes of the de novo Biosynthesis by thymidine and Purinnucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multi-center, randomised, randomised, randomised Phase 3 study by ALIMTA plus cisplatin against cisplatin in chemonaiven patients with malignant pleuramesothelioma showed that patients treated with ALIMTA and Cisplatin had a clinically meaningful benefit of a median 2.8-month longer survival compared to those patients treated with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the investigational medicine (randomised and treated) in the treatment arm.</seg>
<seg id="2435">Statistically significant improvement of clinically relevant symptoms (pain and dyspnea) in connection with the malignant pleural carcinoma was shown in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin-Arm (212 patients) in comparison with the sole cisplainine arm (218 patients).</seg>

<seg id="2503">It is used in obese adults with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with a low-calorie, fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Patients receiving Alli and receiving no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2505">If these enzymes are inhibited, they can't break down some fats in the food, resulting in a quarter of the fats associated with food undigested in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In a third study, Alli was compared with placebo in 391 patients with BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In the two studies of patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who had Alli 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg, compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">In the study with Alli in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2, no relevant weight loss could be observed for patients.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of Alli (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are oily stains at the anus, flatus (winch) with faeces, studldring, greasy / oily chair, finish oily (winch), flatulence (winch) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It must not be used in patients treated with Ciclosporin (to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients) or with medicines such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="2511">It may also not be used in patients who suffer from a long-term malabsorption syndrome (in which not enough nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract) or on cholestase (a liver disease), and in pregnant and breastfeeding mothers.</seg>
<seg id="2512">In July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Glaxo Group Limited for placing Orlistat GSK in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight (Body-Mass-Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypocaloric, fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli must not be used by children and adolescents under 18, since there is not enough data for efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">Since orlistat is only minimal resorption, no adjustment of the dosage is necessary in elderly people and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">• Supersensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other components • Simultaneous treatment with Ciclosporin (see section 4.6) • Chronic malignant absorption syndrome (see section 4.6) • Pressure time (see section 4.6) • Simultaneous treatment with Warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see Sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) can increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich single meal or a fat-rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since weight loss in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or chemist before starting treatment with alli, because the dosage of antidiabetic must be adjusted if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who take ali as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage of this medicine has to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional pregnancy-preventing measures in order to avoid the possible failure of oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">Both in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous use of orlistat and Ciclosporin, a reduction of the Ciclosporin plasma level was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">For the use of Warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick values (international normal ratio, INR) could be affected (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">For most patients who were treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years, the levels of vitamins A, D, E and K and beta-carotene were normal.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take a complementary multivitamin supplement before bedtime to ensure sufficient vitamin intake (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the administration of a one-off dose of Amiodarone, a marginal decrease in the asmiodarone plasma concentration was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect negative effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal and are related to the pharmacological effect of the medication, as the absorption of biased fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The abundances are defined as follows: very frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of known side effects found after the market launch of orlistat is unknown, as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unknown magnitude.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treatment with alli can lead to anxiety in regard to possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered at normal and obese subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases of orlistat overdose reported after the market launch, either side-effects or similar side-effects were reported as at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on studies on humans and animals, a rapid recovery of any systemic effects that can be traced back to the lipase properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect sets in the lumen of the stomach and the upper thin-intestine by covalent bonding on the active serine-remainder of the gastric and pankreatic elevations.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical studies have derived that 60 mg orlistat, taken three times a day, blocks the absorption of about 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies on adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypocaloric, fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of randomisation), has been assessed as follows: as a change in body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as proportion of those who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although weight loss was observed over 12 months in both studies, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first six months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average dietary intake in the Gesamtcholesterin was with orlistat 60 mg -2.4% (initial value 5.20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (baseline 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in LDL cholesterol in orlistat was 60 mg -3.5% (baseline 3.30 mmol / l) and with placebo + 3.8% (baseline 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">The waist circumference was the average change -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (baseline 103.7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (baseline 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, metabolized orlistat in plasma could be detected only sporadically and at extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study with obese patients who administered the minimal systemic stress, two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed Lactonring) and M3 (M1 after splitting the N-molyl-leucine-group), could be identified, representing nearly 42% of the total plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2546">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data do not show any particular danger to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2570">For more helpful information on the blue pages, see section 6 for more information on how to define your calorie and fat levels.</seg>
<seg id="2571">If you have a meal or a meal does not contain any fat, do not take a capsule. alli can only work if the food contains fat.</seg>
<seg id="2572">If you take the capsule in conjunction with a meal that contains too much fat, you risk nutritional supplements (see paragraph 4).</seg>
<seg id="2573">To get used to the new eating habits, start with a calorie and fat-reduced diet before the first capsule intake.</seg>
<seg id="2574">Nutrition diaries are effective as you can always track what you eat, how much you eat and it will probably be easier for you to change your eating habits.</seg>
<seg id="2575">To safely achieve your target weight, you should specify two daily targets in advance: one for the calories and one for fat.</seg>
<seg id="2576">• Reduce yourself fat to reduce the likelihood of diet-related side effects (see section 4). • Try to move more before you begin taking the capsules.</seg>
<seg id="2577">Remember to ask your doctor beforehand if you are not accustomed to physical activity. • Stay physically active while taking and even after taking alli.</seg>

<seg id="2586">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this use information.</seg>
<seg id="2587">The most common side effects are associated with the mode of action of the capsules and by the fact that more fat is excreted from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2588">These side effects usually occur within the first weeks of treatment, since at this time you may not have consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet.</seg>
<seg id="2589">With the following basic rules, you can learn to minimize nutritional accompanying symptoms: • Begin several days, or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat-reduced diet. • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favourite foods and about the size of the portions you normally consume.</seg>
<seg id="2590">If you know exactly how much you eat, the likelihood of you to exceed your fat limit decreases. • Share your recommended fat amount equally on daily meals.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Save the amount of calories and fat you may consume each meal, not to take them in the form of a fat-rich main court or a tasty dessert, as you may have done in other programs for weight reduction.</seg>
<seg id="2592">• Do not store pharmaceuticals for children. • Do not store ali according to expiration date stated on the carton. • Keep container tightly closed to protect contents from moisture. • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with silica gel that serve to keep the capsules dry.</seg>

<seg id="2598">Energy is also measured in kilojoules, which you also find as an indication on the packaging of foods. • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day.</seg>
<seg id="2599">The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should eat with each meal.</seg>
<seg id="2600">What quantity is suitable for you can be found in the information below, which indicates the number of calories that are suitable for you. • Due to the mode of action of the capsule, compliance with recommended fat intake is decisive.</seg>
<seg id="2601">If you take the same amount of fat as before, this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat.</seg>
<seg id="2602">By adhering to the recommended fat intake, you can maximise weight loss while reducing the likelihood of diet-related side effects. • You should try gradually and continuously diminish.</seg>
<seg id="2603">34 This reduced calorie intake should allow you to gradually and continuously lose weight about 0.5 kg per week without frustrations and disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="2604">• The more active you are, the higher your recommended calorie intake. • "Low physical activity" means that you work only little or no daily, work stairs, work in the garden or perform other physical activities. • "Medium Activity" means you can burn 150 kcal daily, e.g. 3 km walk, 30- to 45-minute gardening or 2 km walk in 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2605">• For permanent weight loss, it is necessary to set realistic calorie and fat objectives and to adhere to them. • Nice is a food diary with information on calorie and fat content of your meals. • Try to move more before you start taking alli.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemotherapies that are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), as well as in chemotherapies, which are moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The efficacy of Aloxi can be increased by adding a corticosteroids (a drug that can be used as an antiemetic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use of patients under 18 years of age is not recommended because there is not enough information about the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the agent prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5 hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin) to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was examined in three main studies of 1,842 adults who received chemotherapies, which are strong or moderate causes of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 from 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In the case of chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of the patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 from 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 from 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd to approve the marketing of Aloxi across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated: for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in highly emetogenic chemotherapy because of cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy because of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi for preventing nausea and vomiting that is induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy may be amplified by adding a Corticosteroids given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can prolong the spread of the colon, patients with anamnestial obstination or signs of a subacute Ileus should be closely monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is required with simultaneous use of Palonosetron with drugs that extend the QT interval or if the QT interval is prolonged or which tend to be an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, Aloxi is not to be used for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron did not inhibit the activity of the five chemotherapeutics investigated by tumors (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cyclophosphamide, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">A clinical study showed no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a unique intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a Steady-State- Concentration of oral Metoclopraids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 Inhibitors (Dexamethasone and Rifampicin) and CYP2D6 inhibitors (Amiodarone, Cimetidine, Doxorubicin, Chinidine, Ranitidine, Sertraline and Terbinafine) had no significant effect on the clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience for the use of Palonosetron in human pregnancies is not present, therefore Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common adverse events with a dose of 250 micrograms were observed (633 patients), at least possibly associated with Aloxi, headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10.000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the administration (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post marketing testimonials.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage there were similar occurrences of adverse events as in other dosage groups; there were no dose-effect relationships to be observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies have been carried out, however, due to the large distribution volume, dialysis is probably not an effective treatment in an Aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients who received a moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide (half-life time 4 hours) or 100 mg of Dolasetron (half-life 7.3 hours) were compared with intravenous 1 without dexamethasone on day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, 667 patients who received a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine, and 250 or 750 micrograms of palonosetron, were compared with patients who received 32 mg ondansetron, given intravenously on day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study of strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for indication chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) the effects of Palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of pre-clinical investigations, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The study carried out in 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of the ECG-effects of Palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After IV administration an initial decrease in plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination from the body with an average terminale half-life of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the area under the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are usually dosed proportionally in the entire dose range of 0.- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">Following IV dose of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase in palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations show that once daily intravenous dose of 0.25 mg of palonosetron was comparable to 3 consecutive days, the overall texture (AUC0- ∞) was comparable with the value measured after a one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg. however, the CMAx was higher after the disposable dose of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">Approximately 40% are eliminated through the kidneys and about 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor in comparison to palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro studies for metabolisation showed that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser degree, the Isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the Metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination after an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine, palonosetron as an unmodified ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">Following a unique intravenous bolus injection, the total length of the body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although patients with severe liver function disorder increases the terminal and the average systemic exposure to palonosetron, a reduction in the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies, effects have been observed only after exposures that are considered adequately above the maximum human therapeutic exposure, suggesting a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of preclinical studies, evidence suggests that Palonosetron can only block in very high concentrations of ion channels which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation and can prolong the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose was equivalent to the 30x of the therapeutic exposure in humans) given every day over two years led to an increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (thyroid gland, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal glands) and skin tumors in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages and since Aloxi is determined by humans for one-time use, the relevance of these results is assessed as low for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a negative report recommended for the approval of the drug Alphe6 million IE / ml injection solution prescribed for the treatment of hepatitis C.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means that Alpheon should resemble a biological drug called Roferon-A with the same pharmaceutically effective ingredient that is already approved in the EU (also called" "" "reference medicinal products" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by a viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In the case of a microscopic examination, the liver tissue damages damage, in addition, the values of the liver enzyme Alanine Amino Sferase (ALT) are increased in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">A yeast produces a gene (DNA) which stimulates the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon presented data comparing Alpheon with Roferon-A (drug structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of operation, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients, the efficacy of alpheon was compared to the efficacy of the reference medicinal product to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was set (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail @ emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int © EMEA is acknowledged What were the biggest concerns that prompted the CHMP to refuse permission for placing on the market?</seg>
<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns were expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed is not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Alpheus and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting up the treatment with Alpheon the disease was again flammable in more patients than with the reference doctor. in addition, Alpheus had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the study used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug acts as an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug) is not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for the treatment of impetigo (a skin infection with crust formation) and small infected lainers (crack or cut wounds), abrasions and sewed wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections, which have been proven or probably caused by methicilline. Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), because Alargo may not have an effect against this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients aged nine months, but in patients under 18 years of age, the skin area to be treated must not exceed 2% of the body's surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced), thereby inhibiting the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection had been cleared after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: if the results of both studies were taken together with skin dogs, about 90% of the patients of both groups responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo was not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (bladder-filled cavities in the body tissue) or of infections caused or presumably by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is a irritation at the job center.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Altargo were outweighed in the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small laths, abrasions or sewn up wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to Glaxo Group Ltd., approved for the launch of Altargo in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">The patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of a sensitization or severe local irritation due to the use of reapamine ointment, the treatment is broken off, the ointment is carefully wiped out and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection is started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamin- is not intended to be used for the treatment of infections, where MRSA is known as a pathogen or is suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials of secondary-infected open wounds the efficacy of retinamin- in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be taken into account if no improvement or deterioration of the infected spot occurs after a 2 to 3-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The impact of simultaneous use of reapamin- and other topical remedies on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after topical application on poor skin or infected superficial wounds, a clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of ketoconazole, the medial retinotulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx increased by 81% according to topical application of 1% reapamine ointment on skimmed skin of healthy adult men.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dosage adjustments are not considered necessary when topical retinobulin is used during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are insufficient with regard to a statement on impact on the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retinamine ointment should only be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retinobulin is preferable to the application of systemic antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2696">If breastfeeding continues / stops or the therapy should be continued / terminated with Altargo, the benefit of breastfeeding for the baby and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for woman should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the Altargo was the most commonly reported side-effect irritation at the administration, involving about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode Retapamin- is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mechanism of action of Retapamin- is based on the selective inhibition of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction on a specific binding site of the 50s subunit of the bacterial Ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding site is involved in the ribosomal protein L3 and is located in the region of the ribosomal P binding site and the Peptidyltransferase Center.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding on this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits peptide transfer, block partial P-binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If, due to the local prevalence of resistance, the application of retinotulin at least some forms of infection appears questionable, consultation with experts should be sought.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of retinol compared to S.aureus, irrespective of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the event of non-response to treatment in S.aureus, the presence of strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a healthy adult study, 1% reapamine ointment was applied daily under occlusion to intact and deathed skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children), which received 1% reapamine ointment twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondarily infected traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic intake of people after topical application of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 of deported skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the Retapamin- IC50 for PGP imitation.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolisms of retinotulin in human liver microsoms was primarily mediated through CYP3A4, under low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg) carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro analysis of gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in rats micronucleus for in-vivo analysis of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female rats showing signs of reduced fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which was achieved up to 5 times higher exposure compared to the highest estimated exposure in humans (topical application on 200 cm2 of deported skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study on rats, oral dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (corresponding to ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure (see above)), developmental toxicity (decreased body weight of foetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity were determined.</seg>

<seg id="2717">To indicate irritation or other signs and symptoms in the treated area, you should quit the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not use any other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface that is treated with altargo if it has not been explicitly appointed by your doctor.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between one and 15 years who are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of an existing vaccination plan consisting of two doses, and a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may be used only if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization, and it is ensured that the vaccination plan consisting of two doses can be completed.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is desirable for hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or another Hepatitis A- or -B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines act by contributing to the immune system (the natural defense of the body), as it can defend itself against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"" "after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the viruses and surface antigens as" "" "foreign" "" "and generates antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same ingredients as the Twinrix adult vaccine, which has been approved since 1996 and has been approved since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are given as part of a vaccination plan consisting of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix included identical ingredients, some of the data supporting the application of Twinrix adults were also used as evidence of the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six month period and a 12 month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix carried out a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that Ambirix's degree of protection was similar to a six-month interval between injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix are headache, loss of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, maturation (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission issued a permit to GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for immunization with Ambirix consists of two doses of vaccines, the first dose is administered at the date of the choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a booster shot is desired for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B, the appropriate monovalent vaccines or a combination vaccine can be vaccinated.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-Hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-Hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-Hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) were observed in the same magnitude as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured, whether immunocompetent individuals who have addressed a Hepatitis A- vaccination may need a booster shot as protection, since they may also be protected by immunological memory in case of non-detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection vaccines, appropriate options for medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately for the rare case of anaphylactic reaction after the application of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a quick protection against hepatitis B is needed, the combination vaccine is recommended, containing a 360-degree immunoinininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In the case of haemodialysis patients and individuals with disorders of the immune system, there may be no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody-value after the basic dimmination, so that the administration of further vaccines may be necessary in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Because intradermal injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscles could lead to a suboptimal outcome, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In the case of thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disorders, however, ambirix can be injected subcutaneously since it can occur in these cases after intramuscular administration of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was administered in the form of a separate injection simultaneously using a combined diphtheria-, tetanus, azellular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenza vaccine, the immune response was sufficient to all antigens (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects, it must be assumed that no adequate immune response may be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the incidence of pain, redness, swelling, maturation, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the former deglomeration and preservative-based inoculation formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 inoculation doses of 1027 vaccinations were given at the age of 1 to including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years, Ambirix's compatibility with the 3-dose combination vaccine was compared.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and maturry on a calculation basis for each inoculation dose ambirix, but not on one basis of the calculation per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the dose of Ambirix at 50,7% of the subjects compared to 39.1% in subjects after the dose of a dose of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects who had given Ambirix reported pain, compared to 63.8% in subjects vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of maturation was comparable (i.e. throughout the entire vaccine cycle at 39.6% of the subjects who received Ambirix in comparison with 36.2% of subjects receiving the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The incidence of pronounced pain and maturation was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-dose vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study at 1-11-year-olds, the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirixgroup was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form-inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix a frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection site) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vaccines reported on serious side effects during the 2-doses vaccination with Ambirix or during the 3-doses vaccination with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of formalinininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen was statistically not different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted with vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years, the rate of serum conversion rates for anti-HAV was 99.1% a month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose (i.e., in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The serum conversion rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose of the month after the second dose (i.e., in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- to 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunogenicity was evaluable, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher compared to Ambirix in the month 2 and 6 after the dose of the 3-dose vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune responses reported in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11-year-olds one month after completion of the full vaccine series (i.e., in month 7) are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">Both studies received either a 2-dose inoculation scheme with Ambirix or a 3-dose vaccination scheme with a combination vaccine containing 360 ELISA units of formula-inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In persons who were between 12 and 15 years old at the time of primetization, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be detected for at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response observed in this study against both antigens was comparable to that found after vaccination of 3 cans with a combination vaccine, consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated Hepatitisone A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical trial at 12- to including 15-year-olds it could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies is comparable 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme compared to that in the 0-12 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix was given at the same time at the same time the booster dose of a combined diphtheria-, tetanus, azellular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis and 8 Haemophilus influenza vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with the first dose of a combined mumps-mumps vaccine, the immune response was sufficient to all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study carried out with 3 doses of the present formulation in adults showed similar seroprotection and serum conversion rates as for the earlier formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is to be examined both before and after the resuspening of any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2777">The hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted via viral foods and drinks but can also be transferred through other ways, such as bathing in waters contaminated by water.</seg>
<seg id="2778">You can feel very tired, have a dark urine, a pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms which may make inpatient treatment necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix may not fully protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccine series has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child is already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vaccines Ambirix is (although you / your child is not yet unhealthy or ill at the time of vaccination), a vaccine may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis C or hepatitis B infection cannot be conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any component of this vaccine, including Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction may be caused by itching skin rash, shortness of breath, or swelling of the face or tongue. • If your child has an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B, if you / your child have a serious infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and before the usually scheduled dose of the second vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from an inoculation with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, it will recommend to you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccination dose (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second inoculation dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered one month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vaccination protection prior to completion of the vaccine series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes, Ambirix is injected into people who suffer from severe blood clotting disorders under the skin and not into the muscle. • If you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body's defense / or if you / your child is undergoing a hemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Tell your doctor if you / your child can take other medicines (including those that you can get without prescription) or if you / your child have recently been vaccinated / or if you / your child have received / has received / has given or has planned this in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambirix, it should be vaccinated in separate places and as many different extremities as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually, Ambirix is not given to pregnant or breastfeeding women unless it is urgent that they are vaccinated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information about certain other ingredients of Ambirix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to neomycin (antibiotic).</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">On the basis of data, which have become known for placing first approval for placing on the market, the CHMP noted that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, as Ambirix was put into circulation only in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposition.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammounts can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzymatic defect or hyperammonia encephalopathy (brain damage as a result of high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonia is divided into several individual doses at meals - swallowed, mixed under food or administered via a gastrointestinal hose (through the abdominal wall into the stomach of the leading tube) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">There was no comparative study as Ammontaps could not be compared with any other treatment or placebo (a pseudo-drug, i.e. without active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammounts may also lead to loss of appetite, abnormal acid content in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste disturbances or taste, stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that ammonia in patients with disorders of the urea cycle effectively prevented too high ammonia levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "Ammontaps was approved under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "" "due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval limited information on this drug." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated by all patients in which a complete lack of an enzyme has already manifested itself in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifeste form (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifests after the first month of life), there is an indication for use if hyperammonia encephalopathy is present in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually, taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake required for the growth and development of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as adolescent and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required in patients suffering from an early loss of Carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornithine-scarylase.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with arginine-arginine-synthetase deficiency should receive arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets can not be administered to patients with swallowing disorders, as there is a risk for the formation of esophagus ulcera if the tablets don't get into the stomach immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, respectively 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">Therefore, AMMONAPS should be used only with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency as well as with sodium retention and oedema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyate through the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should be used only with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results with regard to pregnant women is not known; therefore, the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous use of phenylacetate in young rats at high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg), a slowdown of neuronal proliferation and increased neuronal loss occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve endings in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is excreted during humans into breast milk, and for this reason, the use of AMMONAPS during lactation is contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, at least one adverse event (AE) occurred in 56% of the patients and 78% of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an eighteen-year-old anorexic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactate, heavy hypokalemia, armored neuropathy, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose occurred in a 5 month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed doses of doses of up to 400 mg / kg per day for intravenous administration of doses of neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is an metabolic active compound that is conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine that is excreted via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to a urea (both compounds contain 2 nitric atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 Patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that sodium phenylbutyate, which is taken for each gram, can be produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is started immediately to improve the chances of survival and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the earliest onset of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infused, and the disease led to death even in the treatment of peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogues within the first year of their life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Haemodialysis, the use of alternative ways of nitrogen excretion (sodium phenylbutyate, sodium benzene and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborns in postpartal (but within the first month of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and who were already treated before the first occurrence of hyperaemic encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it came with time with many mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygotic form of the ornithine-scarcylase deficiency), which were recovering from hypersensitivity encephalopathy and subsequently treated permanently with sodium phenylbutyrate and a protein-reduced diet, survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is enzymatically conjugated with glutamine in the liver and kidneys, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyate and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined after a single dose of 5 g. of sodium phenylbutyate in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, hemoglobin metabolism and liver cirrhosis as well as repeated doses of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (not controlled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyate and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients following intravenous administration of sodium phenylbutyate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium phenylbutyate in tablet form, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyate were detected in 15 minutes after the intake.</seg>
<seg id="2846">According to different doses, phenylbutyate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) showed no phenylacetate in the plasma in the majority of patients with urea disturbances or hemoglobin.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis of the liver, which were treated repeatedly with sodium phenylbutyate (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma crucible were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The drug is excreted in 24 hours to approximately 80-100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus test, sodium phenylbutyate had no treatment with toxic and non-toxic doses (examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granulate is taken orally (infants and children who cannot swallow tablets, or patients with swallowing disorders) or a gastrointestinal tube or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required in patients suffering from an early loss of Carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornithine-scarylase.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">If pattens were exposed to phenylbutyate (active metabolite from phenylbutyate) prior to birth, lesions in the cortex cells of the cerebral cortex occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an eighteen-year-old anorexic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactate, heavy hypokalemia, armored neuropathy, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to a urea (both compounds contain 2 nitric atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of studies on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, it may be assumed that sodium phenylbutyate is produced for each gram between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium phenylbutyate in granules, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyate were detected in 15 minutes after the intake.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of the shelf life, the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature not exceeding 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this procedure the small measuring spoon contains 0.95 g, the medium measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medication via a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyate amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot separate the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate after the consumption of proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory tests are carried out, you must tell the doctor that you take AMMONAPS as sodium phenylbutyate can affect the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with "acute coronary syndrome" (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example in instable angina (a form of pain in the chest with different thickness) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "stress" (an anomalous measured value in the electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients undergoing PCI, a higher dose is given and the infusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help in patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of Angiox was compared with any dose or in combination with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another medicine for preventing blood clots) with the conventional combination treatment with heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, patients often had a stent (a short tube left in the artery to prevent closure), and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots such as abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, Angiox - with or without GPI - was as effective as conventional treatment in the prevention of new events (deaths, heart attacks or revascularization) after 30 days or a year.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients undergoing PCI, Angiox was as effective in all indicators as heparin, except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bivalirudine, other hirudine, or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may also not be used in patients who recently had bleeding, as well as for people with severe high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that angiox is an acceptable substitute for heparin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the Company The Medicines Company UK Ltd to sell Angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina / non-ST hoisting infarction (IA / NSTEMI) in case of emergency intervention or early intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended starting dose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous bolus release of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is performed in a further sequence, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to clinical requirements, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resumed for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure a release of 0.5 mg / kg is to be administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous bolus release of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of an all-in-one bolus application of Angiox has not been studied and is not recommended, even if a short PCI intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to under 225 seconds, a second bolt release of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT levels, the reconstituted and diluted drug should be carefully mixed prior to use and the bolus dose should be administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value amounts to more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1,75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate renal function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (whether treated with bivalirudine against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is under 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose should be checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate renal damage, which were included in the Phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which resulted in the approval, the ACT was 5 minutes after the application of the Bivalirudin-Bolus without dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in patients with dialysis angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after the end of the intravenous injection of unfractionated heparin or 8 hours after completion of the subcutaneous injection of low-molecular heat.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• Known hypersensitivity to the active substance or any other component or against hirudine • active bleeding or an increased risk of bleeding due to malfunctioning of the hemostasis system and / or irreversible endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and dialysis-based patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when Bivalirudin is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even though most of the hemorrhages in arterial puncture sites occur in PCI patients under Bivalirudin, patients with a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can cause bleeding in principle.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients receiving Warfarin and treated with Bivalirudin, a monitoring of the INR value (International Norised Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after completion of the treatment with Bivalirudin again reaches the existing level before treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Starting from the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anticoagulants (heparin, warfarin, thrombolytics or thrombocyte aggregations) it can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of Bivalirudin with thrombocyte aggregations or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological haemostasis parameters are regularly checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Animal experiments are insufficient in relation to the effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomised to Bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomised to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomised to either unfractional heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the Bivalirudin group and in the comparison groups treated with heparin, women and patients over 65 years of age were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe hemorrhages were defined according to ACUITY and Timi standards for severe hemorrhages as in the footnotes of table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and severe hemorrhages performed significantly less frequently than in the groups with heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and Bivalidator plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY difficult hemorrhage was defined as one of the following events: intraperitoneal, retroperitoneal, intraocular bleeding or hemorrhage at the point of point, reduction of the hemoglobin level ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood supply, reduction of hemoglobin levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood supply, reoperation due to bleeding, using blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Other, less commonly observed bleeding localizations, which occurred in more than 0.1% (occasional), were "miscellaneous" puncture sites, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following facts about side effects are based on data from a clinical trial with bivalirudin in 6000 patients undergoing PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalirudin group and in the comparison groups treated with heparin, women and patients over 65 years of age were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and severe bleeding occurred less frequently in the comparison group than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects not listed above have been reported in practice after a comprehensive application and are grouped according to system organclasses in table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdose, the treatment with bivalirudine is immediately abrupt and the patient is closely monitored with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudin, a direct and specific thromboinhibitor, which binds both the catalytic center as well as the ion-binding region of Thrombin, irrespective of whether thromboin is present in the liquid phase or in clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalirudin to thromboin, and therefore its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin in turn regenerates the binding of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4, which regenerates the function of the active center of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, through Bivalirudin with serum from patients who had come to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS), no thrombocyte aggregation response was induced.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and in patients, Bivalirudin shows a dose-dependent anticoagulatory effect, which is attested by the prolongation of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was performed in the following cases, an additional bolt of 0.5mg / kg of Bivalirudin should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study, unfractionated heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable Angina / non-ST-raising infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomised to obtain a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor either prior to angiography (at the time of randomisation) or at the PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high-risk patients, requiring angiography within 72 hours, were uniformly distributed across the 3 treatment arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">About 77% of patients had a recurring ischemia, 70% had dynamic ECG changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and about 99% of all patients underwent angiography within 72 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2932">The primary analysis and results from the ACUITY study for the 30-day and 1-year endpoint for the overall population (ITT) and for the patients receiving Aspirin and Clopidogrel according to protocol (before angiography or before the PCI) are presented in tables 7 and 8.</seg>

<seg id="2941">Bivalirudine is expected to have a catabolism in its amino acid components with subsequent replacements of the amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolite resulting from the split of the ARG3 Pro4 binding of the N-terminal sequence through thrombosis is not effective due to the loss of its affinity to the catalytic center of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In patients with normal kidney function, elimination takes place after a first order process with a terminal half-time of 25 ± 12 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated application, genotoxicity or reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data do not detect any particular danger to man.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years of age with diabetes who need treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thigh or the upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose (sugar) in the blood or which cannot process insulin efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs very little by humaninsulin, and the change means that it acts faster and has shorter duration than a short-acting humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra has been studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In the case of type 2 diabetes, in which the body cannot work effectively, Apidra was examined in a study with 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of the efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin secretion was observed after six months.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, reduction of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% for human acting insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin lulisin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may be adjusted if administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Germany GmbH a permit for the transport of Apidra across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">As subcutaneous injection, Apidra can be applied either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle, or by continuous infusion in the area of the abdominal wall.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced gluconeogenesis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, insulin needs can be reduced in patients with a reduction in liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change in the effect of insulin, the brand (producers), insulin yps (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the method of production can change the insulin demand.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An insufficient dose or abortion of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, may lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Changing a patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of hypoglycaemia depends on the effect of the insulin used and can therefore vary when the treatment plan is switched.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances that increase blood sugar-lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypoglycemias include oral antidiabetic, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disco-oxidase, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, Pentoxifylline, propoxyene, salicylates and sulfonamide-antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, the symptoms of adrenergic anti-regulation can be weakened or absent from the effects of sympathetic drugs such as betabloosen, clonidin, guanethidin and reserpine.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between Insu- linglulisin and humaninsulin regarding pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin-lulisine occurs in the human breast milk, but generally insulin does not exceed the mother's milk nor is it resorbed to oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">In the following, the adverse drug candidates, known from clinical trials, are grouped according to system organclasses and sorted according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rarely: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold welding, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual fatigue or weakness, confusion, lack of concentration, drowsiness, excessive dog, changes in vision, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Eyelash dystrophy is missed to continuously change the injection site within the injection range, as a result, a lipodystrophy can occur at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias involving unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), given by a correspondingly trained person, or by intravenous injection of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After an injection of glucose, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycaemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose uptake (especially by skeletal musculature and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous GA- be of insulin-lulisine the effect occurs faster and the effect time is shorter than with hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 males aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes, insulin-lulisin showed a proportional amount of glucose compared to 0,075 to 0.15 E / kg and a disproportionately proportional increase in the glucosine effect, just like humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin-lulisin has a double as fast effect as normal humaninsulin and achieves the full glucosine effect about 2 hours earlier than humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data showed that a similar post-prandial glycaemic control is achieved in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal, like with a human acting insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">After 2 minutes before the meal, an insulin inhibitor was achieved than with a human acting insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">When insulin-lulisin is turned in 15 minutes after the meal begins, a comparable glycaemic control is achieved such as for human acting insulin, which is given 2 middles before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin inhibitor in 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the start of the meal was given (figure 1A) before the start of the meal (figure 1A) as well as in comparison with human acting insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin inhibitor in 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the start of the meal compared to humane double-insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
