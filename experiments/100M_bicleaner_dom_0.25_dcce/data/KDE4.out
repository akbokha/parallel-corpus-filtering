&quot; &quot; &quot; translate the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; translate website &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extras website . select from the drop @-@ down list the source and target language of the translation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated in place of the entire &amp; URL .
machine translations are only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . bab@@ el@@ fish produces in the best case a crude translation and in the worst case non@@ sense .
only web pages on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated to the Bab@@ el@@ fish page itself , where you can insert translated texts directly .
package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite their small size , they provide some additional features and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; making them available easier .
further information on how to use &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Add how to add extensions .... Open the card card tools and select the required modules there .
this is a list of default settings from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons package . please note that there may be more modules installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , which contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or before comp@@ iling this package .
to use the crash module , click on Tools crashes . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; crash , or the list of crashes , if available , delete .
the An@@ alogue filter module ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras An@@ alog Fil@@ ters . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as default , the display begins with the top of the document , for example : document@@ et , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; displays a further view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory on local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View is to graphi@@ cally represent ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies using a so @-@ called tree map . tree @-@ maps allow representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose area is proportional to its size .
with &amp; FS@@ View ; displays the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries . in this way , large files can easily be identified , even if they are far below the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View can be viewed as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX command .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation is a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your file system . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have sensible color and label settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle that is switched over View Color Mode can display either depth for easy recognition of the ne@@ sting depth or the representation of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different properties of the respective file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough room to display it or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rec@@ tan@@ gles should be used ( whereby , therefore , representation errors occur by constraints on the sign of the Tre@@ em@@ ap ) . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the label in the rect@@ angle .
for Tre@@ em@@ ap configuration algorithms , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always comp@@ lied with . frames are drawn to display the ne@@ sting of the entries , and that frame will need space , which is no longer available for the frame , if the rect@@ angle is square .
how seg@@ mentation of the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation is left to the implementation . here it is always advantageous for the lab@@ eling and avoid@@ ance of space losses through fra@@ me@@ works in such a way that rec@@ tan@@ gles are created that are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are rows , columns or recur@@ sive branches .
you can set the minimum displayed area for an entry on the menu entry View on area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally , &amp; FS@@ View was intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets designed for K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind application .
the Picture Gallery module can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extras image gallery ... or with C@@ trl ; I .
when you visit the Picture Gallery module , a dialog opens with which you can set the image of the gallery .
the title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the images per line has a sli@@ der and a rot@@ ational field to set the number of thumb@@ nails of each line in the gallery .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ kam ; download albums . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , any media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; contains a fast image processing with basic image editing tools . you can use these to view , comment , comment and correct your photos . the processing capabilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE Image plug @-@ ins interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ kam , easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works complete in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion by li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC color management workflow .
improved database with significantly more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; on the camera or the lens to search for .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also digi@@ ti@@ sed ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of end users . they should therefore report problems and improvement opportunities .
this opens a dialog with a under@@ lined link . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error report system . all the information you need is entered here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer can help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to invite you to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can ask here questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam ; however , in this mailing list English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
you can also visit the digi@@ code ; visit the homepage to find news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam .
the best start to get to &amp; digi@@ kam ; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for signing in the developer mailing list by &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when you first boot , you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database . you can specify a local , remote or removable folder here . just enter path names or click the Fol@@ der icon folder to select a folder .
in the second field , you will need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data log is stored . this path stays the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will additionally be used as an al@@ um@@ eric library .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder containing images as a base folder . &amp; digi@@ kam ; view each sub@@ folder as an album . no picture is being changed . while browsing the folders , you get a progress indicator like this :
&amp; digi@@ kam ; needs recur@@ sively the library path in its full depth . you can not close any sub@@ folders unless it is hidden in hidden folders . this allows you to create extra bs &amp; digi@@ kam ; complete by inser@@ ting a dot in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ tab do not have photos as icons . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and putting it on the folder icon . more details can be found in the Album section .
once you have configured the base folder , you can digi@@ ti@@ ze your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and keyword list to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you are using the raw mode of your camera , it may be possible to handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the section Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ kam ; download albums . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , any media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera then appears as a disk drive . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; uses the g@@ Photo@@ 2 program to communicate with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , distributed software collection for digital cameras that supports an ever increasing number of more than 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Ima@@ ging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and trans@@ missions over the serial port are slow , this connection is now obsol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that the thumb@@ nails can be read out reliably by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera operators . if the if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might not be able to see thumb@@ nails or the creation might be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things on &amp; digi@@ kam , is how simple its functionality can be extended by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I Module : the K@@ DE Image Plug @-@ in Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ View . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way how it can be a user . their advantage is that it is much easier &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes were in &amp; digi@@ kam ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; or change to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
drag and drop pictures works everywhere : you can put an image in a different part of the al@@ mine , above the horizontal dividing line or into another application window . the only constra@@ int is that a picture can not be put into keywords , date list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to emphasize the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . thus , the filter on the fil@@ en@@ ame only works if this ind or symbol view is also displayed . which fields can be displayed you can configure in the dialog of the default settings .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos managed by &amp; digi@@ kam ; managed are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard disk , sorted by the name of their collection in the album properties or by the date on which the album was first created .
if you have set up a scanner you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select album Im@@ por@@ ate images . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album . select album Im@@ por@@ ate screen@@ shot .
to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it . in the pop @-@ up menu , you will need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album properties , right @-@ click on the album and edit the album properties in the context menu .
alb@@ um@@ - collections : are a method to select your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection from you will be used to sort your photos , if you want to add collections from the toolbar or view albums by Collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do so in the settings for collections .
the album date : used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by date .
the Buttons El@@ ders , Me@@ an , New Year : these set the date on the oldest , the newest picture or the average of the album . to do this , first try to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder .
when you first have an album in &amp; edited ; open , the first image in the album is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; This is to help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album symbol , select the image with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu &amp; quot ; As album display &quot; quot ; . &quot; in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can only be contained in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports typing keywords for individual photos in the My Key@@ word list at the bottom of the main window . album collections have another effect . the collection always includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images in this album will be displayed in the image window . each photo will be displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of these preview with the two magni@@ fying glass buttons in the toolbar .
when you open an album for the first time , you have to wait a little while the preview images are generated . this can be avoided by re@@ generating all preview images from the Extras menu .
information on each image will be displayed below the corresponding preview . what information this is , you can edit the settings ; set up . select the Albums Page and customize the preview window to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails feature help windows that appear . the help displays the most important features including all of the keywords in a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the introduction to the main window shows a help window .
photos are everything about &amp; digi@@ kam ; works . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it fits you . the image processing displays your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements . you can select all the functions that came with &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can choose between viewing the images , a slide show or the editing of the images .
you can open the image editing with a photo by selecting either F@@ 4 Picture Edit ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and Edit ... Select . in the editing pane , you will find instructions on how to edit your photos .
it may happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub @-@ menu of opening . to do this , and how to adjust it to your needs , if your program is not listed , see the &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after processing by other image processing programs , problems with the metadata contained in the picture can occur . some programs do not store these data when you save the modified image . this information is lost from EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data such as orientation , aperture , etc .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides two options for turning . the easiest is to right @-@ click on the preview and select Tur@@ ning . in the sub @-@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , right @-@ click on the preview and select F@@ 2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . keep in mind that you maintain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you want to remove a photo from &amp; edit it , it will be moved in the tr@@ ash bin by &amp; k@@ de ; F@@ 8 Picture Del@@ ete or Del if you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift . Del .
the view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ der ; organizes your photos using the data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last modification of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view to show you only the photos of the selected days .
photos with keyword add a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a keyword is assigned a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search .
if a keyword is selected , all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed .
keywords can be sorted into a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to lo@@ gically organize your keywords . you can also find parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My Key@@ word li@@ ste@@ quot ; to work together so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and allocated keywords in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . in addition , the key words are re @-@ imported as soon as they are digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the images are noticed .
you can add new keywords by clicking with the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My keyword , or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword . if you add a new keyword , after clicking on an existing keyword , this will become the sub@@ title of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by drag it to the desired position in the tree and drop it there . then a menu appears , which gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can only be in the tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a keyword by right @-@ clicking and editing the keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword .
to select another photo as an album symbol , you must click the image with the right mouse button and set it as album preview in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
this can happen in two ways : as soon as you select the photos that you want to tag with a keyword you can drag them to the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword . alternatively , you can also right @-@ click on the thumb@@ nail of the pictures and select keywords from the context menu .
you can select a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be shown once you select one of the keywords added to it . in this way , you can select a keyword for each person in a photo , one for the location where the photo was taken , one for the event where it was made etc .
once you have completed a photo with keywords , it will be shown in the main window under the preview of the image .
you can remove a keyword by right @-@ clicking the context menu of the photo and selecting Rem@@ ove from the drop @-@ down menu . the menu only shows you the keywords attached to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view shows a tim@@ esp@@ an@@ able hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection box can be moved using this hist@@ ogram . to select a time@@ frame , just click on the bottom rect@@ angle of the selection box to specify the time unit . this will display all associated images in the main window .
in the box below you can enter a title and save your selection . it then appears in the list below .
includes all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more .
next to the search box is a small lamp the green becomes when the search finds matches . if you click here the filtering is deleted and all pictures are displayed again . if the search does not find anything , then the lamp becomes red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this you get a simple search box as described above . you can save this search here but as a live search , which always filters what you entered as search criterion .
if you are happy with your selection , hit the head OK and the search will be performed . the search field is used to view my search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after the search again , you only need to select the corresponding entry from the view My search list and select an option in its context menu .
if you select Edit Search , the search form will appear again with the search information previously entered . if you select Advanced Search , the dialog for advanced search appears to change your previous search . here you will find more rules for the search . for more information , see section The tool for Advanced Search .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete in the context menu search .
the Advanced Search provides you with an advanced search form with many search parameters you can search for in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the database . an option can be added to this list using search group / search group added or deleted from it . each option can be linked with other via logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ... .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; characterized each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows images to compare by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two picture signatures , the more they correspond to each other . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop each image to find a similar . if you slide a picture from somewhere on the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , it will open and you can drop it there .
sket@@ ch : free @-@ hand colour sket@@ ch : draw a fast sket@@ ch and &amp; digi@@ kam ; find the right pictures . also here a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can zoom in or zoom in or hold it . move it while you press the left mouse button . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . it will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ data folder .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; creates a lumin@@ aire in a separate window that allows you to easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L to add the lumin@@ ous table from the context menu . the selection will be added to the lumin@@ aire and opened its window . if you are back in &amp; edit the main window , you can quickly open the lamp table with L Extras lumin@@ aire .
from the preview bar , you can drag and drop the images you want to compare in the left or right pane of the window . if you select Pre@@ view Synchron@@ ization from the toolbar , and perform zoo and shooting operations on one of the images , then they are also executed on the other picture . so you can compare the same area of both images .
a different mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images . if you use pair mode to navigate from the toolbar , the first two images are automatically loaded into the areas to compare . the picture to the right is displayed in the right pane . this simpli@@ fies working through a series of similar images .
of course , the normal dele@@ tion actions also work directly from the lumin@@ aire like e.g. F@@ 4 file Edit ....
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both preview images in the light table . for example , this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom end of each area you will find a built @-@ in pan function that you can see on the crossed arrows . to wave the visible area of the image , you have to click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the preview mode , then both images will display the same image area .
the zo@@ oming works just like in other views . just use the zoom knob under the images or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both pictures when you are in the preview mode .
what is a digital inventory management - away from the fashion word ? digital stock management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken to the final issue and permanent storage . each of the photos takes up , scans or digitally records digital photos . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures , find , protect and use photos . we view the download , ren@@ ame , remove , convert , group , back , evaluate , archive , archive , optimize , wait and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory management takes up , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , seeks , transforms , conf@@ uses and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is , in accordance with your definition , data that provides information on or a documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you do not use &amp; digi@@ kam . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then use a very fast search and secure archiving that you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate anything into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you have to decide if you want to save them to a dedicated drive or on a network drive &amp; etc .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can be quickly found about your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you do enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; export is then a folder for images you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , workflow , constant supply of images to different subjects and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? separating file types makes batch processing easier . separate new files from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative image .
we also recommend that you save the metadata in &amp; edited the metadata in the Settings page . this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written to the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding item in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change them ? edited &amp; edited ; they have a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work begins , because you should now assign keywords , cap@@ tions and an evaluation to each photo . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . you start best with the rating or ranking . this makes sense , since you can focus on the best photos during further work .
now let &apos;s continue with keywords , keywords , as you frequently refer to other programs or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically build the tree for you or paste the images to the right place . the sorting of the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can be done easily by dra@@ gging a sub @-@ tree to another . the changed words are edited by &amp; digi@@ kam ; updated while it tracks the sub@@ tree .
the graphic shows how different metadata is overl@@ apped . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata consists of many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you just want to let most people see your photos , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . you &apos;re sure you &apos;re interested in how your photos arrive .
look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you this the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ erin ; in the French Nor@@ man@@ die 60 years after landing . wow ! you begin to dream of having associations , memories , the historical time span is again present , you may even hear the silence .
for others who look at your photos , the title may be more important than the picture itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help Him through the motive that moves you has to understand what you understand .
it is al@@ right if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with an inscription for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , as let@@ tering . you can even set it for a selection of images at the same time . K@@ DE even provides you with a spell ch@@ ecker .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without a navigation system ? was it Earth not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of spatial presentation now drives already with speed of light .
the possibilities of explo@@ iting ge@@ olo@@ cation are countless and will become even more profound in the future . I am sure one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travel by using images with geographic indications .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a pu@@ n with copyright and den@@ otes the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all modified versions , so also for the works of others .
the following description tells you which information on the setup page of &amp; digi@@ kam , as information should be stored :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can be used . this field does not support comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators .
author &apos;s title ( syn@@ onym for author &apos;s line ) : linked to the author . this field contains the photographer &apos;s job description . examples of this may be titles such as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer works for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here , which offers the picture to others .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not provide protection against mis@@ use . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or change the metadata embedded in the picture . for individuals , this is only of little interest to the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section we are dealing with problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery firm , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , these cau@@ tious issues must be handled and you can &apos;t trust you for more than a couple of years . of course , you can also purchase CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about Gold @-@ coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 that claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can become un@@ readable but you can reduce this risk by using good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors even when you have just written . that &apos;s why they use a check@@ sum mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and check@@ sums . despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scratches , dust &amp; etc ;
for defective CD and DVDs there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which seems to cause miracles for CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks , hard disks , flash drives , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to capture the format war against HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus nearly six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that was said on CDs and DVDs is also valid for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
your manufacturer &apos;s warran@@ ties include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives on this subject : flo@@ ppy case study
electronic parts of the controller are the most common error cause , S@@ MA@@ RT cannot detect these errors . some errors as@@ cer@@ tained by S@@ MA@@ RT indicate the immediate termination of failure . this is especially read errors and disposal counter@@ s . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the total loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files , but these losses can usually be recovered without major problems .
while most electric devices do not make much noise , it looks different in devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . these can cause severe damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause blocked key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware aging , damaged Mo@@ ther@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able loss of time and money .
the most common protection against spi@@ kes is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy heat and gro@@ oves the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also take care that it provides protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the properly connected devices .
as an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should ensure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are also protected . some manufacturers produce over@@ voltage cont@@ actors which also have a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a laptop , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the modem protection .
while a over@@ voltage protection protects your system against minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a loss of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a break @-@ free power supply .
in addition to protecting against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs . some models allow you to save your data and keep the system shut down . if you purchase a U@@ PS then you should be sure that they comply with the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security in case of electricity problems with the cost of avoiding this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can cost you up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than € 40 .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Sim@@ ple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as a drive on &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software .
they are however very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data about the comparatively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are fed to photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online .
from the point of view of data security , the web solutions are very safe . transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol , and in the large firms it contains a backup and a distributed memory .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all transfers are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs file system ensures at least the data integrity between the operating system and the hard disk .
the worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all these interrup@@ tions remain un@@ discovered until you have one day open a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not currently affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle plate errors at low levels and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for Linux ; and Windows . read this article in English .
Oracle has started an own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms that Z@@ FS is used and is also available for Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss on not@@ ebook and 46 % in work@@ station systems . in not@@ ebooks , the share of the@@ fts amounts to 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to lower damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no one has been si@@ ghted for a long time .
open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ F@@ s and X@@ FS to name the most widespread file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : false , only the speed of the investigation process at a sudden interruption during surgery is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file has not been completely stored before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings from fundamental physical boundaries . it is meant that while technology continues to develop there is a natural barrier to this advancement . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go in the direction of 10 meg@@ api@@ xel cameras . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is worse . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard disk will get you today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not blame anybody else for data loss . so backup your data often according to a plan and test this backup before you make any hazardous like re @-@ installing your operating system , the exchange of disks or the res@@ izing of disks .
suppose you make your backup daily on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a lightning strikes you will be lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget airplane accidents : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house .
therefore disaster prevention is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into the neighbor &apos;s house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , a common cause for data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
full backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential lock : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snapshot at two time points : the one of the complete backup and that of the last differential lock .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup has been made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have been really changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ss@@ h .
backup key images directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or other optical media .
this procedure allows you enough time to uncover and restore losses . at the same time , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . any further di@@ lution should happen manually after which you have made a complete review .
topics : metadata in which image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original retain , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ enting images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing tools , ... , use of the Internet .
in order for valuable pictures to survive the next 40 years that is approximately the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be observed :
as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate as time goes by . unfortunately , you should ask yourself how the current system is compatible backwards . the less variants you used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
so virtualization is available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist print for the ability to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have plan@@ ed the scal@@ ability and want to enlarge the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . with * ni@@ x systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and reloc@@ ate it to a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new disk was recognized by the system , but don &apos;t hang it .
&amp; dollars ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the disk in MB@@ O ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of the drive if needed
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software that can read it , you can create it yourself . this task is easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you shouldn &apos;t use it anymore .
P@@ NG is designed as an open source standard which should replace GIF . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 bits per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG is able to store Gam@@ ma@@ - and Chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved color assignment for hetero@@ geneous platforms .
TI@@ FF is widely used as image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . however , with some cameras you can save your images in this format . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The digital Neg@@ ative file format is a roy@@ alty @-@ free and open file format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and committed to the use of metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are already available D@@ NG and we hope that the competi@@ tor Canon and Nikon will use it at some point .
this is possibly one of the reasons why in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block quot ; technology of the 90@@ s . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in raw format . X@@ MP fits because it stores metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file , and as mentioned above , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization that supports fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in D@@ C@@ MI communities and D@@ C@@ MI communities , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of met@@ a standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images on the camera are edited , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save it to your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
for fine editing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images with &amp; digi@@ kam , edit , then you should add the metadata again .
protect the edited images for copyright using a digital water@@ mark . export them then in web galleries , coding in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam . in the addition of a photos to an album , you will find a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your al@@ ben@@ database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam ; to use , connect it to the computer , switch the camera to the display mode and turn on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
if you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is established , a ready @-@ indicator at the bottom end and thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will appear . some cameras do not display preview images . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for the application will be displayed on the camera for each file , photos , movies , music , etc .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side@@ bars features and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog displays file properties and the photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the tab metadata shows the internal metadata such as ex@@ if , manufacturer notice , GPS , etc of the image . this information is the same as the metadata page bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam , or image processing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button download and then download the selection of all . this will download all photos from their camera into a single album in &amp; edited ; . downloading the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired with the standard selection methods from &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the button Download and then download Sel@@ ected . download the Sel@@ ected button as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , a new option is available for download . in this case the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you select this option , only the new pictures will be downloaded .
when you download the All @-@ Download or Sel@@ ected buttons , a dialog appears with which you can select the destination album in which the photos are stored . you can read the list of the existing albums in the My Albums section . select the destination album from the list and press OK .
after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; edited ; load the photos from the camera into the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete it from the camera . you can delete all at once by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete All button . if you just want to delete some , you need to select them first and then delete selected delete .
please note that there is no way to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera . you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully downloaded into a &amp; edited ; they should be completely deleted before you delete them from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera bug , you should do so via the camera system , as this is much faster .
cameras often do not use very meaningful names as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually re @-@ used after the photos are deleted from the camera . this can lead to dup@@ licate fil@@ en@@ ames if you upload photos from different shooting galleries to the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been taken into the file name .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for database @-@ based sub@@ titles . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created automatically per day .
the options Dur@@ ing the commit opens three other options , which are performed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two concern the data on the author in the Standard Car Identi@@ ty section . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the ex@@ if information to the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you want a different date format than the standard format , e.g. in the editing field , you can use the pre@@ fix photo@@ - % % % % d % H : % M : % S . to do this , turn on the date &amp; time option . for further modifications , you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command .
if you use the option camera fil@@ en@@ ame , you have the option of modi@@ fying the file names in lo@@ wer@@ case letters . or in upper@@ case , if you prefer this .
the new file name , the &amp; edited ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name the camera provides in preview . your settings to ren@@ ame are saved and used automatically when you next open the camera window .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera at the time of recording to perform automatic rotation during downloading . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ adata section , you can read more about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , &amp; digi@@ kam , the photo is in its original orientation . if you want to switch off the automatic turn , use the Advanced button and select the Automatic Rotation in the bottom of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available , &amp; digi@@ kam , you can use this to automatically load sub @-@ albums in the target album by downloading . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ title . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ a data section , you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is usually switched off , and in this case it stores &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . to do so , use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based sub@@ verb@@ s at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the download button . then select upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the selection is done , ask &amp; digi@@ kam ; you see where the images are to be uploaded . select the folder you want and click OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted by your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means a position indicated in long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tude and can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural firms and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you have forgotten later where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser to indicate the area . if you want to send a postcard to another , users want to locate the location of the photo , or simply want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position information of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data get into the picture ? first you should know that exi@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields such as direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ings and map references . the question is actually more like the data in these fields ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via post processing of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical allocation ( manual ) and last via the manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receivers . either as a card module or by transmitting data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you need to save these data in the g@@ p@@ x format , since this is the only format supported by the geographical allocation module .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can use the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Harv@@ ey . it uses the templates created by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle for example .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European road maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , that show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; nbsp ; tries to give you so much control over his work processes as possible . there are many settings that the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; change . to access these settings , you need to edit in the Settings menu ; set up . the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left side .
select action can be set to preview or start image editing . you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; specify when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the identity and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface . also with a database synchronization , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields .
author &apos;s title is a syn@@ onym for author &apos;s line : this field should contain the professional designation of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations such as a photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author field , it must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the name of the photo . this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be listed here as this is the picture of others &amp; quot ; .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC field . this ensures that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be edited and edited without getting lost .
image cap@@ tions saved as embedded labels ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the in@@ scrip@@ tions embedded in the pictures .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse poin@@ ter rests over a file in the main window . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ kam ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam ; tries to display , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list .
you can reset the default settings by pressing the Ref@@ resh button on the right of each category .
the settings of the light table by &amp; digi@@ kam ; can be set on this page to the default values . each time you open the light table these settings are switched on . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the entire image size lad@@ en@@ quot ; should you have one , then you can get better visible results .
by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer another color , you can select it here . you can turn off the toolbar if you are using the image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in image processing , this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling it is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia for more details .
with P@@ NG compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality because P@@ NG is using a loss@@ less algorithm . the only effect is that the image data requires more time for un@@ packing and un@@ packing .
the TI@@ FF file can be used to comp@@ ress the default emul@@ sion algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of TI@@ FF images . it does not affect the image quality because the de@@ late algorithm works loss@@ less .
with the adjustment of loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss@@ less JPEG 2000 files . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JPEG . as this paragraph has been written , metadata has not yet been supported but was in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , the image editing has only been an image viewer for photos . at the moment , it quickly develops into a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the image editing settings .
the default assumption is that all green pixels are the same . if the straight @-@ line green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels on odd lines , this difference creates a grid pattern in the output . this option records the image a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . standard it is a fixed color balance based on a white card photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensor has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the sharp@@ ness . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the default is the pointed lights , so the parts of your pictures that are burned on , due to the inability of your camera to catch the pointed lights , as continuous white . the setting colors will trigger some unusual results because it shows the pointed lights in various shades of roses . last , you can attempt to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights .
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not so fast satur@@ ating like green and red . &amp; d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question how much color or white you want .
if you select the Rec@@ on@@ struction option , you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than the default 1 . however , this can be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing . in order to keep the time for the dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the sub @-@ raw data that come from the color @-@ filtered image sensor that has many cameras and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour @-@ construction .
&amp; nbsp ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ia @-@ Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . however , it produces color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges .
if you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for color gra@@ ding correction , since it is performed during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as the color information from a color space in the others are to translate the colors as precisely as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions when a picture is opened in image processing / start color management module with raw files .
color Profile Fol@@ der Set the folder here , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ kam ; examine this folder during startup .
settings of ICC Pro@@ files You have here the option &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to leave . everything can be changed when opening the raw file .
the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
the input profiles should fit the camera creator and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain any color mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w g@@ amma does not correct conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth .
there are other options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of @-@ Profile that you can em@@ ulate as your image would be given back from a device . this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore have a very saturated color .
for most cameras , it is quite obvious what color profile is provided for . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course , this answer is in@@ official :
the Canon profile expansion makes it possible to realize the style for the target : F for an exact style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing . by providing this interface , &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use and these will then be digi@@ sed ; these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands .
for more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can get to the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the slide show settings should be easy to understand . the upper knob adju@@ sts the time between the picture transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds good . the other check boxes activate or remove the metadata that are displayed at the bottom of the images during the display .
the camera features show a list of all supported cameras on the left . on the right side there is a button Automatic detection that attempts to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is connected properly , turned on and in image display mode .
at the bottom end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera bar .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn on .
if not , you can manually set the camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera &apos;s menu .
you can select any name for your camera , which is displayed in the C@@ ameras of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the confirmation dialog for moving pictures in the du@@ st@@ bin , you can view &amp; digi@@ kam the conversation ; to delete a photo in an album . in the sections del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album , you will find more details .
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be used tac@@ itly by &amp; digi@@ kam ; if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries , you will need to save the changes with the button change .
you can also display the display of the welcome screen from &amp; digi@@ kam , at startup . this speeds up the start @-@ up of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
after searching for new photos and digi@@ ti@@ zing the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos . this length@@ ens the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; if something was deleted from the base folder , &amp; digi@@ kam , you decide if it should delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be edited in &amp; edited ; used to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected under Settings Design from the toolbar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use this to view your photos and for correction and improvement . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the display / editing .
image Edi@@ ting contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam ; so you may not be part of your distribution . more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in the Image Processing section .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , zoom factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top and below the tool bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of the image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before using the Save button or the Save button from the toolbar . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo once you have saved the image .
you should possibly create a copy of your image before you change it . you can do this with File save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore File menu or the Rest@@ ore button Rest@@ ore image processing in the toolbar . you will then lose any change that you have done on the photo since the last save .
almost every action of image processing can be und@@ one or restored . the last action can be und@@ one by modi@@ fying and / or restoring , by selecting Edit Rec@@ over from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should use the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to und@@ o and C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB , press the button or restore button in the toolbar for a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu items , all actions in between will be und@@ one or restored .
once you have started editing , you can move between the photos on the same album or the same keyword while using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , picture high , picture down or the entries in the File menu . if you made changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save them .
you can zoom in and zoom in the photo by using C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : select En@@ large factor automatically
view Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . normally , you can also view the toolbar . if you do not want this , you can view this in the Settings dialog by &amp; digi@@ kam ; view the main window . see the section for setting up image editing .
if you want to print the current image , in the File menu , you can print image and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual images or whole phrases . entire image preview pages can be printed from your selection . you just need to select the images using the standard methods and select Print Assistant from the Album menu . if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice .
the &amp; nbsp ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation arrows , also in image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicking on the same tab allows the side@@ bar to appear or disappear again in the margin .
the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied to EX@@ IF and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields to be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are trun@@ cated after 2000 characters and special characters are converted . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label field in other applications , you should consider these limitations .
after you have commented on it , use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next picture , the cap@@ tions are then saved .
in addition to the application button , there is a button . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always done when you have selected a metadata setting that is always written into the images .
the review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select it and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field Ur@@ gency . the coding follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword list shows a search box for filtering the key words , the key@@ wor@@ d@@ press and a select box with those previously used in this &amp; edited ; session applied keywords .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered keyword . you can quickly limit the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful when you have many key words .
the input field at the bottom is a further relief when entering keywords during a series of pictures . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , they are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all keywords in an image are stored in the keyword IP@@ TC keyword .
if multiple images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword @-@ tree , this will only apply to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , If you want to add a keyword , please read the Key@@ word filter section .
the Key@@ word Key@@ word filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , date , keyword and search views . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two will be displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also drag and drop keywords . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keyword . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection .
in the upper example , the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day . the Key@@ word filter is based on No keywords , which reduces the amount to three pictures . they were selected using C@@ trl + a , and after that a keyword is drawn from the right keyword @-@ tree to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword should be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be disabled under Settings different .
if you have a rule with and created a rule and note that it should be one or its , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry that is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can set an Advanced search for all elements of the database using the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the group button . the options then look like this :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web and Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? the free disk space is limited to 1 GB and you won &apos;t want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner come with a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor matches those of your camera or scanner and that match the colors you print or publish on the web from your digital dark@@ room .
when the issue comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you can make informed decisions at any point in the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should provide you with sufficient background information on color management . in addition , links with deeper information will allow you to make your own informed decisions to make you get the desired result .
if your image workflow satis@@ fies all six criteria listed below , you do not have to worry about color management .
they work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
your only other picture editions are by email or the web where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should one use another color space and thus have to think about color management ?
a visual example of limiting s@@ RGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to stick my monitor when I decided to work only in s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you work in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to scale your monitor since s@@ RGB means you are al@@ lied to s@@ RGB . if you work as a color space of s@@ RGB then you either need to calibr@@ ate your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic corrections , which can improve one image in most cases . therefore , use it before trying any further manual processing .
the functions Norm@@ alize , compare , Automatic balance and contrast extend from the menu Cor@@ rection Automatic correction attempt automatically from your colors to make the best . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the brightness values over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test point as bright as possible without changing its shade . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed out .
comparing : this method adju@@ sts the brightness @-@ factor of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible . sometimes , the comparison results in very good results in the improvement of the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only garbage . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in a picture or it destro@@ ys it .
automatic comparison : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright shades and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram area .
contrast ampli@@ fies contrast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ ous intensity of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the largest possible area and a new iter@@ ation of all values in between . this is only visible in washed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool for carrying out white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is slightly limited because of a color space with 8 bits per color . so if you can move too far from the original picture , areas with over@@ exposure may occur . if you can perform the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is copy@@ righ@@ ted by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . they start it using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand side , both the original image and the preview of the target picture can be viewed . preview will dynamically adjust the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance , then click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target picture has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
at the top right , a hist@@ ogram shows that dynamic changes are changed once you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide if one of the three colors or your sum is displayed .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . shadow adjustment lets you enhance or di@@ mmer the shadow details of your photos .
to play stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . this way the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance to the list of default settings . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will see the combined result in white balance . this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save as and Load buttons do exactly this . any setting of the white balance that you have set you can save it into a text file and load it again later .
the Pre@@ ferences button returns all filter values to their default values and the associated neutral white balance . note that neutral settings will also result in a different photo than your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed .
8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better suited for high quality images . however , this coding also requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG formats .
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be done by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed instructions for using color profiles can be used to consult the chapter on color management .
another important tool is to find color correction in the menu . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously and allows you to save them for more photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always makes the same error and you always need the same correction .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation , that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool color effects provide you with four color effects , a solar installation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that was created when using a partial pressure of a short flash light and then completed the development of the image . this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination . the result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the solar process . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment ultimately creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper .
this is an example of the solar heating effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and edi@@ ts the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &quot; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot &quot; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simple , it beauti@@ fies many photos .
the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts . the characteristics make it a film of choice for nature photographers .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large images the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the lumin@@ ous intensity of the photos . you can experiment to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjustments can be viewed in preview . once you are satisfied with the result , use the O@@ k button and you will be applied .
if you do a photo in poor light conditions , you can get the opposite problem : a too big satur@@ ation . even in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice for reducing satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex mould gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous thickness / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is set up to improve exposure . even if the dialog with this tool is very complicated , you only need the area of the sli@@ der for the purpose described here . more concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of the intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked in and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn how to operate it is to shift the controls and make sure the picture changes .
on the right , the original and the preview of the image can be viewed . the preview will be updated dynamically , based on the image settings . on the left hand side , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it can be set , whether the hist@@ ogram is represented with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic y axis . for images of a digital camera the linear representation is often the most useful . in pictures the large ranges of a constant color , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic division is more useful .
three kno@@ bs : the top one for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle sounds , often called g@@ amma values .
the three color brush can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , middle and bright tones . furthermore , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as in the input values . for example , the compression of the output values can be used to create a hidden image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons the set values can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later . to do this , the Gim@@ p Levels format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input value is automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun shades . check the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the input value of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels .
the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you only get the effect shown in preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below is an example of adjusting entry values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
on the left hand side , half of the original and the target picture will be displayed . the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right side , the following options are available :
modified channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel that is changed by the module :
in addition to this box there are two icons to switch between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for images taken with a digital camera , the most sensible is the linear mode . for images with large areas of a constant color , the linear mode produces a wide beam . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic mode will help .
for example , if you move a short@@ cut to the right , i.e. the bright tones , you can see that these bright tones correspond to darker tones and that the associated image pixels are darker .
a red marker is shown on the preview of the original picture . if you want to change this marker to the area you want to change , a matching line will appear on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve you created can be stored in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
when using this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ ting buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if over@@ exposed pixels are found in more than one channel , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you only get the effect shown in preview and there is no effect at the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were placed with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel bl@@ ender of &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photo .
the channel bl@@ ender is another highly developed tool to mix the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first hint as to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left area of the window will show you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider .
the preview of the image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram shows the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are lower right : regulator for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will keep the general brightness even when you change the appropriate color components . this is particularly convenient if you also use the option Mon@@ ochro@@ me , since the channel mixer is then THE tool for generating magnificent black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour space . the colour space consists of small noise art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear in the same place in the color channel and their noise pattern in each channel looks different . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by reducing the color space first .
the save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . you can save any bl@@ ender setting for later and then load it . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you only get the effect shown in preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is enabled and the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your ability to be abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , since color images can easily be converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene images and fits especially well to portraits against the sky . similarly , like the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange filter : simul@@ ates black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic sky effects and can simulate lun@@ ar scenes at the time of the day . similarly , like the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
this is very similar to the process of ble@@ aching a pressure and the re @-@ development in a se@@ pi@@ ate . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) s@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image .
by adding a texture to your image , whether it &apos;s a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , stit@@ ch an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : shifting this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the image .
a paper text effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to see . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with &amp; digi@@ kam ; add tool frame , a decorative frame can be added to a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photograph is not an easy task . one way to keep your attention is to set the image a decorative framework . this is a psychological barrier for the looking eye . add to picture frame the module can be started from image processing .
type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image . with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , sh@@ kant@@ y surrounds it with a nice three dimensional frame which is ideal for a kno@@ ck effect and decorative inserts a decorative frame with patterns .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target picture that has been decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing images , especially if you have used the tool Fol@@ low the aspect ratio before .
with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into a picture at any location . this also goes to several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply insert the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its features as you need them .
any setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press &quot; OK . &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply mold templates you can place a template over a picture .
the image template menu can be used in image editing can be used to place templates over a picture .
for the template there are no limitations regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to take the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . if you want to add your template file , simply send an email in English to the &amp; digi@@ kam ; mailing list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your sten@@ cil folder with the button base folder in the dialog . here , select the folder where you copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the Tem@@ plate folder . selecting a folder will automatically update the thumb@@ nail of the templates automatically .
below the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the picture below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shrink : this button shr@@ inks the image underneath . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . to do so , take the image and place it at the desired position .
use OK when you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adjusted automatically to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but produces , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny pictures .
blur@@ ring mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ per . in fact it sharp@@ ens no bit , it works rather psych@@ ically . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes here a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by copyright by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three because it really improves sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for custom@@ ization .
photos without focus as well as most digi@@ ti@@ sed images require a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is because the digital@@ isation process must consist of only minimal differences at one color point . this in turn results in sharp edges becoming blur@@ red . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras usually need more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
JPEG images often have a camera internal sharpen@@ ing . images in raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some scann@@ ers use a focus filter while reading the image . if you disable it , you will get control of your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with sharpen@@ ing ke@@ ying . you can use the menu entry Cor@@ rupt sharp@@ ness .
you should be careful with this because the results do not work very naturally : the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , the most suitable technique to shar@@ pen one image will re@@ focus the tool . you will find further information and a comparison of all the techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the picture a little sof@@ tly is much easier than it is to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ten with the menu entry Cor@@ rupt soft@@ ness and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ inten@@ sely mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . a demonstration you can see here .
the original image and the preview help to edit the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should be tested first . an increase in the radius or amount will ampli@@ fy the effect . if you make the bl@@ ur mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ates will produce sharp edges .
the radius indicates how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , you should shar@@ pen images best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . thus , one can define a minimum difference in order to apply for one edge of the filters . thus , areas with a soft altern@@ ation between tones are excluded from sharp@@ ness and therefore avoid f@@ law errors in faces , heavens and water surfaces .
this is an example of the bl@@ ur mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image the ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mask was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focused a picture by enhancing the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ righ@@ ted escape filter algorithm of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to focus a picture &amp; quot ; re@@ focusing &quot; ; in which it revers@@ es the focus . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener filtering . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a bl@@ ur mask .
in practice , the circular spl@@ itting works much better than the G@@ auss &apos;s fold . the G@@ auss &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which leads to the mathematical results also from the swelling pixels , which are far from original source pixel . in most cases , the FI@@ R Vienna In@@ verse of the G@@ auss &apos;s fold is even very strongly influenced by the remote Pix@@ els .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular fold . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should yield 1 good results .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module .
noise filter : increasing the noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 are only rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 , the image quality is very bad . a good value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will further s@@ me@@ ar the image .
G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the g@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your bl@@ ur Gau@@ ß &apos; sch is . this is most often caused by a previously introduced bl@@ ur filter . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a value un@@ equal to zero , you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . increasing the size of the die can produce good results , especially if you select great values for the circle sharp@@ ness or the gauge &apos;s sharp@@ ness . note however that the module is very slow when you select large values for that parameter . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try out all cutting , color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before changing the image otherwise . the reason for this is that many operations make changes that are not immediately visible , but later leave uncomfortable art@@ ef@@ acts .
when you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , non @-@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by dis@@ car@@ ving a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing .
even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the bl@@ ur . for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimum Line@@ ar Filter . practically , the result of the FI@@ R Vienna Fil@@ ters is always at least as good as the bl@@ ur mask . the FI@@ R Vienna filter is often better in processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused image :
the original opa@@ que color image that needs to be corrected . this picture has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focuss@@ ed result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the methods of sharpen@@ ing in digital pictures you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the sli@@ ps control the bl@@ ur of the area which has been dark@@ ened in order to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink tin@@ ting allows a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , you can adjust this here .
the image error correction tool is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the in@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available default settings are listed below :
if you want to adjust filter settings more finely , you can use the tab smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detail conservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . a small value leads to a uniform smoo@@ thing over the image . whereas larger values are mainly homogeneous regions smooth and details sharp . a value of 0.@@ 9 should keep details so that no sharp@@ ness is subsequently necessary .
directional depen@@ dency alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes evenly in all directions while a value draws near to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film grain or CCD space , a high value will generate wave @-@ like patterns . JPEG &apos;s arti@@ facts are best removed at a value near 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all@@ . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . set this value to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if very much noise is present , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : specifies how often the algorithm is going to go through . normally , 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angle step width since &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is chosen small , it should also be chosen small . make sure that small angles produce a long run@@ time . so , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs .
integrated step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integrated step width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never larger than 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation : the amount of quality you receive by choosing this option is only minor , but doubles the term . we therefore recommend that you om@@ it it .
the Save as and Load buttons do exactly this . correct any hi@@ ring of image errors can be saved to a text file and loaded later .
correc@@ ting image errors is relatively fast at work . however , it may take a long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Canc@@ el .
below you can see how image errors can be corrected with small arti@@ facts . the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see there is a strange black arti@@ fact in the foreground that caused by a poor film shift during the trip . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts , e.g. from dust or hairs on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mos@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scanned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the details of the sub@@ window and the Advanced Settings window can remain in the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time the filters are used per pixel and can bl@@ ur the image . the area indicated by the radius moves over the picture and the color in it is smoo@@ thed and therefore smaller mistakes are adjusted .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the distance between the filter to the front to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be maintained and the noise or s@@ me@@ aring occurs again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , it is not possible to remove all noise or noise peaks . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak h@@ iss or j@@ peg art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend that you change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the colour tolerance of the image . we recommend that you change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas , which are typically more obsc@@ ured , but it also gre@@ ets the shadow areas .
d@@ amping : controls the adjustment of the phase j@@ itter d@@ amping . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of the lumin@@ ance density . if it is increased , the edges appear smoo@@ ther if it is too high a s@@ me@@ ar occur .
save and load : these buttons are used exactly for this purpose . all noise reduction parameters you have set can be stored into the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and corrected with ( 2 ) . noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . fortunately , the solution to draw the picture a little sof@@ tly is fortunately much easier than to shar@@ pen a picture . use tool to sof@@ ten with the menu entry Cor@@ rupt soft@@ ness and experiment with the smoo@@ thing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove g@@ auss &apos;s noise , film grain , scratches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that appear in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized pictures .
the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG &apos;s arti@@ facts : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; arti@@ fact quot ; - small standards that are to be seen in the un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the Save as and Load buttons do exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be saved to a text file and loaded later .
photo restoration is relatively fast at work . however , it can take a long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Stop .
below you can reduce like a photo with uniform noise reduction . the module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera to an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film grain on the faces .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures have been applied to an old color photograph that has been read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts that were caused by the scanner lighting and the photo paper .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows to remove Hot@@ pixel from photos with a CCD camera above , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel &quot; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel &quot; ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
load this file into the Wi@@ zard with the button dark image . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these will be highlighted in the preview preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important to capture the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the matching dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels .
the image area and preview will help you to correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixels . these are the available filters :
average : an average of the adjacent pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn up for the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are approached to compu@@ te a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are moved to compu@@ te a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is shown below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under exposed corners , an image .
wide angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead , they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior .
many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter , which may increase the required closure time in such a way that it is impossible to hold the camera by hand . wide @-@ angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller , otherwise blur@@ ring effects are caused by motion .
it is possible to simulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by applying an equi@@ val@@ ent transformation on a raw image created without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applies the transformation with a c@@ ec@@ centric filter to an image . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three regul@@ ators you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three further exposure of the target picture .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light absorption at the point of the largest density of the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which corresponds to an optical filter with aperture setting of 1 , or by chance a lumin@@ ous intensity of 2 . increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it by a small degree .
brightness , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vig@@ nette correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you have to adjust the exposure of the image with these options . the controls only provide positive values , since you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fin@@ er read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment of the exposure of the target picture , leave the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation out of &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applied to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture . a brightness and contrast correction was also performed with the image using this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses an copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree covers the general geometric distor@@ tions of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of the fourth degree correc@@ ts the remote corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two combinations , any geometric distor@@ tions can be almost eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of distortion 2nd degree . negative values can correct t@@ onal distortion and positive values cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion 4th degree . this value appears more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the image . for most lenses the &apos; corners parameter has the reverse signature of the parameter in general .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and thus correc@@ ts first degrees . negative values increase while positive image res@@ ize .
ligh@@ ten : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog box illustrates the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start .
the ton@@ n@@ - or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or res@@ izing . best do this correction as the first one . if you re @-@ cut a picture and then perform a t@@ onal correction , the effect would be apparent of the wrong .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal hel@@ p@@ line . move the mouse cursor into an important place , such as the edge of the sea or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . subsequently , you can correct the ton@@ ne / cushion distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove these with the trimm@@ ing tool in the Trans@@ forming menu from the image processing or via the Zoom control of this dialog .
the next logical step for some subjects such as images from the front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera by hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the t@@ onal correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simulate the infrared feature of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org web page which is reachable under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ ra film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview , you can set two parameters setting film grain and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . add the Add Film Fat@@ al option if you want to simulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO control changes the amount of film grain and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white as snow !
as the filter bl@@ ends color channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos because the colour information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the but@@ ton@@ ers .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter film grain is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film grain on your pictures . this is known by classic high @-@ speed movies such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the makers mix big silver bas@@ kets of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film gran@@ ulation effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated image acqu@@ ires a timeless atmosphere released from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ ined view especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you have to use this filter .
the regulator can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although higher values are often needed , to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of oil painting . it uses an copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and style life are good for this effect .
there are two controllers to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brushes are better suited for large images . fl@@ atten the smoo@@ thing or , viewed from the other side , the sharp@@ ness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the editing is marked by ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel large picture is 1 and smooth 17 .
the ink drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a coal sket@@ ch . the lines that define the outlines in the drawing are emphasized . images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect .
there are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smoo@@ thing ) .
this is an example of the char@@ coal filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter engraving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was stamped in wax . it uses an copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works especially well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important part of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ strous landscape .
the depth allows to set the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distor@@ tions effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and let it look like it is seen through blocks of glass .
wave blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 the picture is distorted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with button ending .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of blur@@ ring effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom infin@@ ity : blur@@ ring the image along star @-@ shaped lines eman@@ ating from a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : photography from a car or train , camera .
blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image sof@@ tly in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and glossy focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or add a warm and subtle glow .
sharp@@ ness : blur@@ ring the image through random shift of pixels and thus simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
intelligent blur@@ ring : finds the color bas@@ ins in the picture and wi@@ pes it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then recre@@ ates it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with button ending .
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops on your image . this makes it natural to your pictures a wet appearance . it uses a by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of dro@@ pl@@ ets on the image .
you can use &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing can hold a range free of rain@@ drops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter rain@@ drops , the area will remain free of rain@@ drops .
this is an example of the reg@@ gae filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the edited image ( 2 ) suggests a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can turn it in the right direction by mirr@@ oring or turning . the tools can be found in the Trans@@ forming Rot@@ ating or Trans@@ forming menu .
photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached ? how can you re@@ inv@@ ent or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose to change trans@@ formations size in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is shown below .
changing the tool to size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to infl@@ ate .
many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ ate was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the new size tab and are listed below :
keep the aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if very much noise is present , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ bar effect it must be set higher than 3 .
the Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . enlar@@ ging any capture for photo can be saved as a text file and loaded later .
photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it can still last very long and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with button ending .
you can see below an example for photo bubbles by magni@@ fying a small color image onto the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard enlargement to compare .
the cutting of a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool for putting together a picture . in order to cut a photo you simply need to create a rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle . you will then see this rect@@ angle while moving the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by pulling at the corners of the rect@@ angle . create a new rect@@ angle by simply drag it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The cutting button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the entries file Save or File save under the File menu to save the newly cut photo .
in the preview section , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog remains unchanged .
in the tool Fol@@ low the aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as a portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and width is always assigned to the width .
the tool Fol@@ low the aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use cen@@ timeter , inch or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically .
at the bottom of the dialog , you can use the Max . relationship button to set the area to cut to the greatest possible , depending on the selected relationship and orientation .
the tool Fol@@ low the aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horizon@@ tal or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the modified image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image .
the setup help settings allow you to blend hel@@ ds so that you can better put your images together . these help are :
harmonious Tri@@ angles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third el@@ bows , harmonious tri@@ angles are a way to divide a rect@@ angle into a similar harmonious tri@@ angles at the diagonal .
golden centre : the golden centre is a division that refers to various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it has been used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition which follows this rule is considered visually harmonious .
the golden center provides liquid help lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ ale will bring you closer to your goal to achieve good results for your photos . in comparison with the third @-@ hand gel , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the gaze of the observer along the line of the spiral and creates in this way a symmet@@ ric visual flow .
a second rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . there should be something that direc@@ ts the eye to the center of the composition .
the golden tri@@ angles also derive from the golden spiral discussed above . their verti@@ ces are the middle points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equ@@ al@@ ateral tri@@ angles . diagonal to these lines can make a static object more dynamic .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your focus at one of the intersection points and other visual information in tri@@ angles .
the options Horizon@@ tal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions .
with the Color button you can set the color of the help lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the guides can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines of your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
if you do a photo , then it happens easy that you do not hold the camera vertically or horizontally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can do this with &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing and the tool free rotation . select Trans@@ form Free Rotation and adjust the target angle .
rotate your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this slide are specified in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button you can set the slide again to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window .
for your help , the free rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse cursor to position the two lines . after moving it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you have turned a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the Trans@@ forming cutting from image processing .
an elegant way to cut the picture is the Automati@@ cally cut function . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smoo@@ thes the image a bit after the turn . however , note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tival trans@@ formations are performed by a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically calculated . on the right side of the dialog , you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty spaces created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty spaces created by the transformation , in pixels .
upper left corner : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the trans@@ formed area .
right above : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the trans@@ formed area .
corner left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the trans@@ formed area .
right below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the trans@@ formed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image is gre@@ ased a little . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adap@@ tations generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective , you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the image with trans@@ formations from the image processing .
the tool is used to move a part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . a horizontal line , for example , will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left . this is not rotation , the image is distorted .
select your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can rotate horizontally and vertically at the same time . if you press pres@@ ets , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target picture will be displayed on the right of the preview section .
for your help , a vertical and a horizontal line is displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sc@@ aling , the picture gets a little blur@@ red . for a single sc@@ aling , this effect is mostly neg@@ li@@ gible , but two circuits cause twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after the sc@@ aling the picture has un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with trans@@ formations of the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries are compiled . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam .
because of this depen@@ dency on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF below .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; displays only files in formats to those who know . this happens on the basis of the file extension and a comparison of those with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , &amp; digi@@ kam ; the file in the image processing is displayed . you can edit this list of file extensions that &amp; digi@@ kam ; see the Con@@ figuration section for more information .
virtually all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras allow you even to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression techniques to digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to store image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG with the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss@@ less when specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TI@@ FF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam ; convert . in the Con@@ figuration section you will find further information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ kam .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which came into &amp; digi@@ kam ; this is supported by more than 200 raw file formats . all supported cameras can be viewed from below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ kam ;
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are commonly recorded in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam ; does not understand these formats and therefore does not have any built @-@ in possibilities to view or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ kam , the &amp; k@@ de ; use the settings to play movies to start playback .

if you exchange steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can do the first four adjusting with the module White Balance .
many tools you need to edit photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ kam . your description will follow here .
all image processing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , soft marks , noise suppression , re@@ focus , un@@ mas@@ king , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog box that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image .
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter to the current image . to the left of it , five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertically share without dup@@ licate . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area to the right of the selected preview range .
horizontal parts without dup@@ licate . the upper part shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview range .
the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
divide horizontally . the upper part shows the original and the lower one to compare the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ M@@ ouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in preview , otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons which can be switched on to display over@@ exposure and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to preview . you can drag this box with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to preview the preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the side@@ bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data originate from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can zoom in or zoom in or hold it . move it while you press the left mouse button . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pallet files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the pallet files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can apply either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are stored in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ settings and hot user defined color and last used colors .
in the Load palette , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders for files .
the cursor is displayed as a line in the palette view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the color beside it . the color is described below the palette view . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used for selecting . to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cursor to it . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box Bei@@ m C@@ ursor is activated under the button color , the color is inserted from the color table at the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the over@@ writing mode was selected .
a selection that has been created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions copying , trimm@@ ing and past@@ ing .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a new@@ line sign if another color follows . if there are three figures in the clip@@ board , they can be added as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ;
the colors in the palette and the selection of color sel@@ ections can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color sel@@ ector on the left .
&amp; graphi@@ c@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , in particular in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs , which &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; includes , are out@@ dated according to the program author &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; cal@@ vi@@ z ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ .@@ Graphi@@ c ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ Graphi@@ c ; displays graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Po@@ sters ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in graph@@ ene in &amp; kate , re@@ comp@@ utes the graph and displays it in &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; )
menu to make the graph in &amp; kate ; to open or to open the graph@@ ene in &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; in a &amp; Po@@ sters ; component
load large graphs ( currently there are problems from about 1000 knot@@ s and one h@@ ack to show more than these no@@ des )
further required software : &amp; k@@ d@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for displaying the graphs . required in detail :
the main window displays the opened graph , each in its own sub @-@ window . initially , if you start &amp; cap@@ itali@@ ze without an argument , the main window is empty as shown in the bottom screen@@ shot . in this case , the toolbar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list Rec@@ ently opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog file .
after selecting one or more &amp; dot ; -@@ files , the main window looks like in the bottom screen@@ shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by a factor of 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the file has just been changed from another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph should be rel@@ o@@ aded or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ Graphi@@ c ; can also remember your decision , so that later it will proceed as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can use the Settings k@@ graphical viewer ; see also .
when you open a graph node outside a current &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; eg , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new graphical viewer ; or to display the graphs to be loaded in a sub @-@ window of the current instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog .
when you start the program , you can re @-@ open all graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice either as well as change it later .
you can also specify how to split the graph to multiple pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen .
when you use several pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph , which come to a page , should be adjusted to this page . in doing so , the aspect ratio is ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective sections of the graph .
preview with a graph@@ ene divided on several pages without header and with a different font
the Renew@@ al Load page gives the option to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can specify a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or ask the program every time .
the Open page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; cli@@ ck@@ viewer ; specify when a graph is opened outside of a running session . you can specify a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is asked .
the session management page gives you the option to specify the start behavior of &amp; cli@@ ck@@ viewer ; you can specify a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session ) or decide to be asked at every start .
the context menu , which usually appears with a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s ; opens up further possibilities :
here you can select from different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ layout algorithms . the entries described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directional graphs . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered displays of directional graphs . the algorithm places the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as little edge overl@@ aps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ deriv@@ ative graphs . it produces images according to the spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is equivalent to statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a boun@@ cing spring model for un@@ eri@@ ved graphs . it uses the Fru@@ tiger &apos;s pure gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ lat@@ tice for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm orders the no@@ des in a circle , according to the description of Six und Tol@@ li , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for specific diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command that is then executed by a shell . the command should display the graph file as a parameter , and output the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can give &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ algorithms change the graph before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph ( directed or executed ) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for deriv@@ ative graphs ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not be shown and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
displays the What is the mouse cursor . with this mouse @-@ cursor , click on a &amp; GUI ; -@@ element to get more help to this element ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source folder of the source repository .
&amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program that uses the &amp; graph ; tools for display . it requires the following program packages :
a special setup is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; in the Settings menu , you will find more options .
the main window of the symbol editor is divided into five areas : the main toolbar , the bar for drawing tools , the status bar , the .@@ color palette and the grid in which you draw the symbol .
creates a new icon . if the current file has been modified , you will be asked if you want to save the changes . afterwards , a dialog appears in which you can choose whether the symbol should be created from a template , or whether you want to start from scratch .
this function is disabled if you do not have a step und@@ o .
inserts the clip@@ board contents as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
set the current icon in shades of grey . this can create colors that do not match those of the symbol palette of &amp; k@@ de .
does not change the symbol , but sets the current drawing color to the color of the point you click on .
the status bar displays the actual actions . from left to right , it shows you the x@@ - and y @-@ coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current drawing area , the magni@@ fication factor and the current number of colors of the symbol .
inserts the clip@@ board contents as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
open with Set@@ ting &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; set up ... a dialog with the three pages Tem@@ plates for symbols , background and toolbar .
with Buttons Add ... , Edit ... and Rem@@ ove , you can modify the templates for Standard File , Source File , Com@@ pressed File &amp; etc .
select Transpar@@ ent pixel or display a ruler and set a color : or a ch@@ ess@@ board as a transparent display . you can also choose the size for the ch@@ ess@@ board : the kar@@ os for small , medium and big as well as the color 1 : and color 2 : select .
the K@@ IP@@ I module provides tools to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner supported by the san@@ e project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to make this work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you open the menu entry Images a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select here the source from which you want to fetch the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will appear by replacing the default duc@@ t@@ he default values to select your image accordingly . see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image with the Scan button . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , bottom corner .
be sure that the window will be displayed completely , otherwise some settings may not be displayed .
after you have pressed the button scanning you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the image file options appears . please remember that the type BM@@ P does not comp@@ ress and therefore creates very large files . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image to be saved .
you can create screen@@ shots after you have selected the screen shot in the Im@@ por@@ tiv@@ e- &gt; screen@@ shot menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete Desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if All its own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work place . if you have selected the entire work surface you will only read the window under the mouse .
the delay determines how long screen shot is waiting before it starts . if you need to switch to other working surfaces , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there .
after the screen@@ shot has been created , the dialog box options dialog appears with the options described above .
the K@@ IP@@ I module calendar does not currently have any documentation . if you are interested in writing this please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
this module records your albums on CD / DVD media with the K@@ 3@@ b fire@@ wall . you can simply select the albums to be archi@@ ved . an HTML interface can be created for the convenient navigation . also , the Aut@@ op@@ lay option is available for Windows platforms .

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management on the Internet . Fli@@ ck@@ r makes it possible to send your photos to people who are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world showing photos of your camera and show your photos safe and private to your friends and family all over the world .
the Fli@@ ck@@ r module can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
if you use the module for the first time , you are led through the process of generating a token . this is used for your authentication . so , it is virtually your ID to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so you can register with Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after successful registration , the module can send photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r &apos;s website . you will be presented the following page after a successful registration .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you have pressed Yes , you get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
when the ex@@ porting module is started to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be greeted with the following dialog which displays the current access per@@ missions that the module displays . for up@@ loading , you will need write per@@ missions . the module currently does not support any other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions .
the button Photos should be pressed once you have set all the other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . if you press on the O@@ k button , start up@@ loading the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r Server .
the keywords field can be filled with a comm@@ a @-@ del@@ im@@ ited list of words . these are added to the image as keywords during upload .
the Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ ly options allow you to set access per@@ missions to your images . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you change the option Modi@@ fy the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos will be changed in size before up@@ loading . the size is taken from the value registered at maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is modified so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export has no documentation right now . if you are interested in writing this please contact the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF data of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I geographical loc@@ alization module provides tools to loc@@ alize images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and width are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data , you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ api.dll may download and convert data for you from your GPS device .
picture Ge@@ ographical location Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the top @-@ looking dialog appears then . to create a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file .
when the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed which indicates the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera direction must be converted with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera time here .
the setting for maximum time vari@@ ance indicates the upper deviation for the GPS time and camera direction . if the deviation is below , the data will be merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have trace data from a location for pictures you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ating and difference in minutes can be used if you have no suitable data . if you know that in reality there is a location in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relating to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same place . since the dialog is the coordinates of one call to the next , you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . select the appropriate region and enlarge it . choose this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the map can be changed between map mode , satellite photo and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ ft@@ tool to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module picture gallery is a tool for ex@@ porting a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums which are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded by U@@ TF @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the menu has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted . the Ri@@ der selection allows you to select all the albums which are to be exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . the three buttons on the right hand side allows you to quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the Al@@ ben@@ vor@@ schau and the text appearing in the header of the HTML page will be displayed .
the tab Ap@@ pear@@ ance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self explan@@ atory . the option For each picture one page creates a gallery in which each picture also gets its own page . if you then click on a picture , a new page is opened in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your standard picture viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show
the tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all your associated images . select a folder where you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images .
with other color depth you can change the default color depth . of course , it also influences the file size . all other settings are self explan@@ atory .
the Ri@@ der thumb@@ nail allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for preview images , which are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window tells the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
when the module has created the pages , the window will not be automatically closed . you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors have occurred during production . the web browser is automatically launched at the end to preview the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and folders . it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its features .
after the start , a picture is displayed in full screen mode by default . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of the loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases as there is no compression of the color information . this can be found e.g. in the P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I digital camera client is a tool for you to connect your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the Import function of the metadata module you can copy data from one image to another . to do so , select the image you want to copy in the main program and then open the Import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the image , so the image to which you want to copy the metadata .
this function does not work for all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write into any destination format . JPEG is supported when writing . please look at exi@@ v2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages . you can also add a basic image transition between the individual images . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you first need to select the images to be packed into the MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au . after that you can create the module via Extras MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au .
the images you have selected are then listed among image files in the Portfolio , where you can also change the images or contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to re@@ play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV Standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre @-@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should specify the time in seconds a picture is displayed . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high , very smooth image changes .
the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should leave it black . the name and path of the generated file can be set under the name of the m@@ peg output file .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all settings to your preferences , you can start the creation of the movie with the encoding button . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now quickly or in all rest enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slide while you are back .
if a critic appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can customize the paths to the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages using the Settings button on the right .
the Print Assistant lets you print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is , for example , useful for you to improve or print directly with the Gim@@ p module .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import and convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w of Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it produces the same results as the software from your camera creator . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first select the RAW file that you want to convert and start the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window then appears in the mode for a single image . with the Pre@@ view button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides if the camera settings are to be used for white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later .
a four @-@ color R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected for you to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG @-@ switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it .
tagged Image Format , TI@@ FF , keeps all the information of your image and uses loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you plan to process your images frequently or otherwise use them later , you should not choose the JPEG format , since it allows only a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ates . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose to save JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is included in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the ex@@ if information .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el .
batch converting mode allows you to convert different images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , they have the possibility to over@@ write existing file automatically . this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar indicates how far the conversion has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images on an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can reduce or enlarge the image . to do this , four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 dot . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . for example , you can use this option to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : no proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
print preparation : prepares the image for the photo printing . the user can set the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target picture , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your favorite email program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
after you have started the module , the image window will be displayed with the images you have selected . by clicking the Images button , you can add more images using a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview is displayed on the right .
you can also drag and drop images to the list of images to be sent .
the images will be removed from the list of images to be sent with the button .
after selecting all the images , press OK to open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client . you only need to add the addresses and the subject here . the pictures you have selected are already attached as attachments .
make sure not to send too many pictures at once . most email accounts have limitations for the size of the sending emails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you will need to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments to the images are added to a text file and the mail is attached .
the P@@ NG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . therefore , you should use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG images in JPEG format and the original images are in JPEG format , then the original EX@@ IF data will be added to the images you want to send .
when the process is finished , the window will not be automatically closed so you can view the status messages , searching for errors . your E @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . you can close this window with the button C@@ lose .
after starting the module Advanced Sli@@ deshow a window with questions like you would like to show your slide show appears . you can choose between the albums selected by you and all pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL @-@ Transi@@ tions option in the presentation mode sel@@ ects very elegant image transitions by means of Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the Display option flag makes sure that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner of the presentation .
the loop flag makes it possible to display the presentation in an infinite loop . you can then manually cancel it with Es@@ c .
the option to random@@ ly select images makes sure that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of the pictures in the album .
the distance between the images can be set between the images . 1500 mil@@ lis@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect .
there are over a dozen transition effects between which you can select . random@@ ly , each transition between the images sel@@ ects another effect .
during slide show you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on .
with this toolbar you can stop and restart the presentation , jump to the previous one and stop the slide .
at the left lower edge of the screen you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Time &amp; Date has no documentation right now . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the work surface .
this module uses the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as a background for your K@@ DE desktop .
as soon as you have your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; browse them , see picture . how you can see through a comparison with the picture are now available in each group , so in people , places and in group keywords .
in the browser window , you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current preview images .
when you press the mouse on the entry people the view of the browser changes . see picture .
when you select another person , only the images are shown on which both persons can be seen . through this selection method you can limit the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few individual images .
if you have selected all the people , places , and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your sphere of activity .
in the picture every person has the same symbol before their name . however , you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own thumb@@ nail , which of course also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . see the picture .
to view images next to the name , select the button located on the right side of the toolbar . in the pop @-@ up context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can view e.g. symbols with images of individuals and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you do not have suitable images for your keywords ) .
however , you need to specify which image to display for each individual person . to do this , you will need to view the image acquisition window ( in more detail ) and select the image for the respective person in the context menu . here you can adjust the image for the respective person . in the selection window , you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and choose which part of the image should be displayed or cut .
when you visit the Search item in the main window , a dialog will show you which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties .
if you enter a string in the label or description , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to be searched ; the date can be either a part of the total date , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all the images by certain names as you can see in the picture . here , the pictures where Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user manual for &amp; photo@@ album ; if you don &apos;t like to read hand@@ books , but rather want to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and watch the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialogue , select the demo if you start &amp; photo@@ album ; start for the first time , or select from the menu help menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ Demo . as a result , some sample images will be loaded and you can try out the functions of &amp; photo@@ album .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this bar displays date statistics on the pictures in your database .
the tim@@ eline can show you several different time units . each bar then displays another unit . you can switch between classes years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 minutes sections .
the tim@@ eline can be inter@@ actively used in the following ways : you can change the displayed items preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of that date will be displayed in the preview ) and the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures , if you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select a range of tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drawing the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . if you select an area , only images of that period will be displayed in the preview view . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you two options available to create HTML pages with your pictures . one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other is available as a module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album is described ; integrated version described which you can create via the menu file HTML ...
before creating HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and destination . in the following , each area is described more precisely .
first , enter the title of the title and a description that will later contain the HTML file . on k@@ photo@@ album , HTML @-@ example pages you will see an example of these settings .
next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ Export file should be created which can be seen on the overview page .
finally , you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . by doing so you can avoid that information is displayed to the viewer without description . for example , that all images are from a party . note that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; currently all images are exported . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this section , you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why it is not specifically dealt with .
at the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images . this means that those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 do not have to download any images that have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 for example .
the viewers of your page can change the resolution at any time you have set . so you can browse your images with low resolution , leading to a lower transfer time . if you want to get a larger image larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting , you specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
best select a base folder for all your HTML files and create a new sub@@ folder for each successive set .
first , you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored . this folder is saved and automatically added at the next time . this allows you to select the location for all future images . here you can either select a folder or a log supported by K@@ DE , for example :
once you have created your images , you can check if they are all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser will start after the pages have been created . otherwise , the URL you set here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you have to manually copy them there . for the import function , see , properly works you need to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings that I have just described have moved to base folders and URLs . a sub@@ folder is created in these settings , whose name you specify in the output folder .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or anywhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; coming together , you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the images . however , if you have spent a lot of time applying the image information , persons on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you must with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work will not do again .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import others to your database . the image properties are imported and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in the fact whether the images themselves are stored with the file or whether the file is only a short@@ cut to images . the advantage of storing all images in the file is that you have all the images together and that you can transmit this file as independent . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file looks for the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are located in the .@@ k@@ im file &apos;s folder . if the corresponding images are not found , the images of the URL you have provided when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export .
the following describes the dialog for ex@@ porting images that you can invo@@ ke from the File menu ... menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
with option Manual close to the .@@ k@@ im file , you have to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the option Automati@@ cally copied to the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most images have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth comp@@ ressing the files . if you want to do so , simply select the Export File option .
the last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size . if you send images to your friends , you may not want to send the images in full size because the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each image should be maximum 800 pixels high and wide .
if you import a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu ... select , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in description .
the import assistant consists of four steps . first you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folders the import pictures should be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category people of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) while this category is in your database . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialog box , which categories the file to import should be imported and which categories they correspond to your database .
in the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . for an example , see the image .
it has to be easy to browse and view images : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; for example , if you look at pictures of your holiday in Italy and discover a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will go through the various steps of ( 1 ) setting the information about your images , via ( 2 ) searching and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program to manage your images . however , it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often this also includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; saves all of its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top@@ most folder of your images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in CVS , where they want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; note the folder in which your images are stored and will automatically re @-@ use it in future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so start a different folder tree with pictures , you can &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / Pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you can access a window that allows you to change the settings of &amp; photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , the various settings options are explained to you .
on the left you can see six different symbols that allow you to preview and view options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which can be accessed by pressing a button on the F1 key and clicking on the desired option .
it describes how you can set different properties for each image , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups , such as objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog used to process existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog , you can set up complete members groups , e.g. all members of a group at a time in a group , rather than all groups of a medi@@ ate as explained in .
in the list above you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window there is a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares its module system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ ti@@ sing and G@@ wen@@ View . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plug @-@ in Interface .
the modules can be accessed via the modules menu . the modules can and are not described in this manual since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page , which you can access via the module itself .
since the modules are used by several applications together , it may be that the modules were tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always test new modules with the demo database before you use them on your own images The &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; demo database can be accessed either via the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu .
the applications that the modules over K@@ IP@@ I share in common are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not working . this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between photo@@ album and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications make their pictures in albums : an album is simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this type of order is not supported , it simul@@ ates order for some modules to make use of the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
it simul@@ ates &amp; photo@@ album ; the current album that simply fits the current view , so all the pictures that show you the picture preview at the moment .
in addition to the current album &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the modules also have to pass a list of albums . here is a photo@@ album , as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the contents of a category , e.g. all persons , each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you specified in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you are using the category people , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , so do so , so if you would have selected people to view it and pass it on to the module .
because some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . to do this , launch the Settings dialog and select the modules to load modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start your photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used to from any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and toolbar at the top . at the bottom of the toolbar you will see the window with which you can browse your image database .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to include any picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons depicted in the picture , where the picture was taken etc . you can set each image either individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is pictured and all pictures taken in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these notes if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in view , you can see three lists with a text box by selecting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; because you will always use them when you enter information about your images .
the following idea is based on moving images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are depicted , you can , through that the used names are moved up , find people faster and assign them .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the title for sort by date under the list .
if you have selected ann@@ ot@@ ations for each image individually , you may want to edit all the selected pictures and add these pictures with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case , simply click on the front and back buttons below the preview of the picture on the right .
if you have taken several images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and to use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are California .
in the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as an over@@ board . to show you that it is a sub@@ group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the Comment dialog context menu it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category . in addition , you can also drag an entry to a category and drop it to make it a sub @-@ category of this entry . attention , this pres@@ upp@@ oses that you just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically .
you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bar that form the top edge of the frame . you can also make your own window from a frame by dra@@ gging it outside the window area .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs , that you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options ... button , which offers among other things the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window .
you can also fade out a frame completely . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and then hide / hide windows . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select View ima@@ gery in your browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected pictures , or all images in case you do not have a filter . an example for this is shown here . you can configure the thumb@@ nail size by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this will be shown in the picture viewer . if you have not opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the preview preview . simply select the respective images you want to delete and press either the Rem@@ ove button or select Edit Sel@@ ection from the Edit menu . now the window that you can see in the picture will be displayed .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; namely images also without having you saved on the hard drive . of course you need to have the pictures stored anywhere so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can view the view from &amp; photo@@ album ; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard drive .
images in which the upper right corner is trun@@ cated are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the images 5 @-@ 9 , the thumb@@ nails are present so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . you can also view these images with the picture viewer .
as you see , this feature requires you to copy and copy files from the folders and copy them back again . so if you want to avoid anno@@ y@@ ance , like mess@@ ing up your images , please buy a larger hard drive to save all the images .
in the Pictures menu , you will find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the images in such a way that at the end those who want to make others in@@ accessible and click Update Lock in the Privacy menu . alternatively , you can also control all the images that your little sister may see , and lock the menu entry Any@@ thing out of the current view .
this allows you to decide which images should be hidden in the case of the case . if you now give your little sister to your laptop , simply select the menu entry Add images , so that all the images you have locked will be hidden .
it is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the Privacy menu .
on the one hand , all images on the hard disk and on the other hand anybody who can access the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection serves only to deny the view of private pictures .
the reason why you spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and describe hours over hours with it is of course that you want to look at them sometime . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; via an image _ and video viewer . you can start from the preview as described in .
the viewer can see you in . of course it shows the picture , but additional all the information you have to enter about the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc .
if the info box on the top part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and drop somewhere else . you can also configure what information is displayed and if any information is to be displayed . all of these options are available right click on the viewer .
if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you would have selected people from your browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have multiple images loaded in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image up and down . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often a new image can load can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus or minus .
a very useful feature of the viewer from &amp; photo@@ album ; to be able to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the entire space on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer , you can simply drag a rect@@ angle into the image . with the mouse button you can simply zoom in a rect@@ angle . with the minus button you can zoom out again The Plus button zo@@ oms in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom angle is selected and shows the outcome of the zo@@ oms .
with the item button you can reset your zoom so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sync &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button sets the zo@@ oms , so that each pixel matches a pixel of the image . &quot; &quot; &quot;
note that the only zoom operations that work in videos show that they are in and out with the plus and negative button .
with the turning functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work for videos . you can make notes on the current image with the menu item comments from the context menu .
when you look at pictures it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to place on the picture . in the moment you can look at it and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter these names .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you look one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to paint pictures with features while you look at them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . in this you see a picture where the characteristics A , B and C are set .
as soon as you have features placed on your images , these are available in your browser . so if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , simply add any notes . this is described in . after that you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view . if you display categories in the special preview view then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the character for the feature after the image was selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you will be allowed to paint on the picture .
the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . in this way you can und@@ o your gem@@ s later .
in order to enable the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; switch on the painting from the context menu . to finish the painting , simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ remo@@ er ; you need to use the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not completely master , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you absolutely have read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wire model views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the sub@@ object of an already selected object , since all sub @-@ objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position on which you want to insert the object and either click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the In@@ sert menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following pop @-@ up menu is displayed for you to choose the correct position :
with del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have modified properties , click Apply to take these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message with error description will be displayed . then you can correct the input errors and click Apply again or disc@@ ard the changes with Canc@@ el .
when you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view .
press thumb@@ nail in the property view and a small sample of the scene will be rendered with the selected texture . as default , the whole texture is rendered , even if you want to render only a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , tick it locally .
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can move these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse inside the entire window .
each object has a Visi@@ bility level as a wire model . you can indicate this value relative to the level of visibility of the parent object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only when they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility level chosen in the toolbar .
the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window layout or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it as you like . you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window over or under a view , drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then displays the new position .
to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other , drag the beginner in the middle of another view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the tabs at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement is floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to solve a view from anch@@ or@@ age , drag the starter on the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing upwards in the fas@@ cia strip .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the fas@@ cia strip . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views to the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor it anywhere .
the current window view can be saved with View Window Order ... save . it displays a dialog where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
if you created a scene , you can render it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ remo@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to render , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ remo@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene , click the Ren@@ dern sign The Ren@@ dering icon in the toolbar or select the Sc@@ enes menu item .
a render mode meets the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and the quality of the rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of render modes , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or in the View R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... menu , the following dialog will be opened :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode .
in the box size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you only want to render a small area of the image , select the check box below and enter the image section for rendering to the input fields .
in the quality combination field , you can select the properties that are used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use retro @-@ reflective illumination . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User &apos;s Guide to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if an image is rendered with only one beam each pixel , different errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ é pattern or tier effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not shown when they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally , images with this feature look better .
if you switch on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and combines &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . the standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling is the adjacent pixel . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively , because each pixel is continuously separated and adapted because the rec@@ ur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray will follow a beam of each pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the specified threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference then is :
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are further tra@@ cked and tested for further sub@@ division .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the ray process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn on J@@ it@@ tering , modify &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; which calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light reflection . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can specify whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated rays have not hit any object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly finished , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene file , select Import menu entry ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supported &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ remo@@ er ; not yet the full command of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ remo@@ er ; want to import this source text between the two particular comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object to the opened text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
copying and past@@ ing in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ remo@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ remo@@ er ; a scene changes . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on Help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ remo@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . insert here the path to your top and the version . supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example height field data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to add the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used to display the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used to display the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates .
you can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the sphere you can set the level of detail separately for two directions .
when you tick high detailed fi@@ del@@ ity for advanced projections , all wire model views are further sub@@ divided if the camera uses an extended projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and vertical projections . this feature gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time for rendering .
when you flag a wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is represented in a check@@ er@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you cross the floor , a floor below the objects will be rendered . the floor is represented in a check@@ er@@ board pattern of two adjustable colours .
if you tick edge smoo@@ thing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value . more precise information on the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section .
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the window instructions section , explains how to create and save window orders .
the drop down sel@@ ector standard window arrangement : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ remo@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders . a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and select a selected order with the Rem@@ ove button .
every window ordering is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement . you can add new views with the Add button and delete selected views with the Rem@@ ove button .
with new column , you create a new column on the right side of the existing windows , with un@@ ts you anchor the window under the existing window , with card card you will get a card map view together with the previous view and floating anch@@ oring the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ remo@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , very popular among beginners : a sphere on one level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , consider these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied for rendering , as a result you get a black image .
if you do not insert light sources , your entire scene is in the dark and you will only get a black picture .
if you have installed everything correctly , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ remo@@ ver ; the following pre @-@ set window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and symbols of the toolbar . please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols frequently so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
to follow this guide , first you need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit menu item . you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the various parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; see further details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location .
when you use the Apply button or the Enter key , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could , for example , insert a qu@@ ad ( insert End@@ ress Body qu@@ ader ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a complicated method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ remo@@ ver ; offers actually a simpler way . you can use an infinite layer as ground :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the Apply button or enter the Enter . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view now also shows the plane , though at the moment only as a fin@@ ite fin@@ ite plane . when you render the scene , the plane stretches to the horizon .
if you look carefully at the object tree , you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor when you click on the symbol + in front of the object . in this case , you will only see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should move the ground to the exercise one unit below the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . choose shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment choose something simple .
in both cases , a dialog opens where you can select how to insert the object . please select first sub@@ property . the pigment will then be displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = floor pigment ) , click the thumb@@ nail button to see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the pig@@ ments preview only shows a matte black material because you have to enter settings for the pigment again . therefore , always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on thumb@@ nail .
if you don &apos;t see a color on the header and the ball in the preview , just click the Apply button and then enter the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the symbol , you should get the following result :
in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , select mon@@ ochro@@ me each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
this step should be done simply because you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ remo@@ ver ; the ball can be created just as easily as the ground :
in view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget to press the Enter key or the Apply button ) , so the ball has contact with the floor . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground as you have shifted the floor by one unit down@@ wards .
of course , rendering now results in a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . in the following step , put a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign it to a material . as on the ground , give the sphere a pigment as color :
select first sub@@ object and change the name for example in sphere pigment . click on sphere pigment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots and click Apply or press Enter .
the settings of shine effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome @-@ plated surfaces even when metallic : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities are available to you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ remo@@ er ; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tracing is a render method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three dimensional scene or model .
when you cycle a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hypo@@ the@@ tical beams from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render counts how this ray is reflected and broken by the objects , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog effect .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source , you see nothing , the picture is just black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ remo@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file is inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you will need to enter a name and a disk space .
re@@ covers the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last saved version are dis@@ car@@ ded .
you can only select this menu entry if you do not have any saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit Ref@@ resh .
stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ ride an existing order .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ remo@@ ver ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cut and the default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . with this option you can change pres@@ et short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ remo@@ ver ; modify commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . with this option you can add and remove tool@@ boxes for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ remo@@ ver ; add and remove commands .
a b@@ ump map is a way to simulate rugged surfaces without having to model every diff@@ ra@@ ction on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both a b@@ ump map and a texture mapping .
basic elements are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are made of dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture mapping is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis by applying an image file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that can be displayed by clicking on the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s ; or the return key .
you can specify whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or if all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file type , type the first character of the file name in the browser window . then , a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if a matching fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file will be highlighted .
in the dialog box - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five flash@@ cards . in three of these , General and editing and slide show , you can set the working of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; set . in the other two , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts for the respective window can be specified .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color you can set further down . default is not full@@ screen mode .
this point is enabled , loads &amp; call@@ show ; already the next image in the folder while you are still watching the current image . this reduces the delay when you select the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show .
with this option stores &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; when closing the name of the last opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bars to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is bigger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; so set up that only some of the file types that the program can display .
with this option the display window will be enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
specify whether the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field , or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows to the right of the input field . the default value is 3 seconds .
if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows to the right of the input field .
change the keyboard short@@ cuts for the various operating modes of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays preview images for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
shr@@ inks the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is open anymore .
display the picture in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
enter the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ photo editing based on &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing . &amp; show@@ casing ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform corrections and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ casing ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user contributing his part to reporting at least issues and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ casing ; makes it as easy as possible to report errors or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu contains an entry report you problems or desires . this displays a dialog with a link . if you use this , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes .
&amp; show@@ casing ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ casing , then we encourage you to join the user @-@ mailing list by &amp; show@@ photo ; you can ask here questions to other users of &amp; show@@ casing . however , you can ask questions about other users here soon . however , in this mailing list English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions for joining the developer mailing list by &amp; show@@ photo ; .
&amp; show@@ casing ; tries to give you so much control over its work processes as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ casing . to access these settings , you need to select in the Settings show photo ; setup dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left side .
in the field of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the sub@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . you should contrast the colors with what you should display . under@@ exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of the show has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides you with important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same page bar in the image processing . you can view these by clicking on one of the five tabs :
&amp; kan@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that no longer makes images to scan and save .
&amp; kan@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that no longer makes images to scan and save . &amp; chan@@ g@@ ite ; can open a dialog for each image to save or save images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set at the command line of &amp; channels ; using the command channel -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog to select the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; chan@@ g@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not handle these options .
to scan a picture , the user can only start a preview scan and then scan for scanning area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection .
when the image is selected the final image can be read with the scan button .
when saving a preview in the settings selected , the image will be displayed in a preview window as shown below . if saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and Sch@@ lie ? en will lead to a crash and you will return to the main window .
the Settings button opens the dialog of the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the type as &amp; output ; images can be selected . dialog to save each image opens the dialog before each scanned image . if you want to save them with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are saved with the Save without a file name . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as a default dialog for saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change it by clicking on ...
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the images to be saved automatically and is also the suggested name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that is counted up every time a picture is saved .
the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t will be used .
the Help button starts the K@@ DE support with the &amp; output ; manual . the About button launches the K@@ DE about dialog for &amp; output ; the Settings button displays the dialog for settings and closing can be used to quit &amp; output .
&amp; chan@@ g@@ ite ; is licensed under the GP@@ L and the lib@@ ks@@ ane library used by &amp; kan@@ l@@ ite ; note : lib@@ re@@ e is licensed under the GP@@ L with an exception .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; use like all other programs ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes . below is a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global short@@ cut can be set by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and selecting Global Keyboard Sh@@ ort@@ cuts ... selecting the right mouse button in the player window and setting short commands ... Select .
you may set up existing multimedia buttons to work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands work . this will make your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are usually found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P features of collection , context browser , player , playlist , playlist browser and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports command line options from Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; additionally , Amar@@ ok has some command line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of depen@@ dency . please check in your script , if all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog so that the user knows why a script does not run .
require require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit end
in scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the base for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , you can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command ; any K@@ DE installation should be included .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow exec@@ uting external programs and commands . for this purpose ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here &apos;s an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; send noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this reason , strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should continuously monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore the events if there is no use for it .
configure Wei@@ gh@@ tens the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok puts the working folder on the folder where all the data should be stored .
track@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is all@@ u@@ ded . the script now could &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P @-@ Fun@@ ctions , further information about the new piece can be retri@@ eved ( for example the metadata or the piece length ) .
volume Change new@@ Volume sign@@ alizes a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths includes the path to the selected files of the playlist , when a user @-@ defined menu entry has been cli@@ cked . sub@@ menu and it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le are also passed to allow the script to identify the cli@@ cked entry . to remove an entry , you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( Sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; it ends , or when the user stops a script , it sends Amar@@ ok ; the SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M signal to the script . this signal should be processed to do e.g. cleaning tasks . this includes , for example , storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user &amp; eg downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically standard T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the cap@@ tion of amar@@ o@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages correctly .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file per@@ missions :
if your script package is finished , you can add it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist , rather than having to work through endless menus . maybe you just search for a certain title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to listen to ? then the playlist browser is the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult , the dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists will automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right thing to re@@ discover your music !
usually you have to enter the following in the basic folder of the Amar@@ ok Sour@@ ces to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
since &amp; Amar@@ ok , auto@@ conf and auto@@ conf , you should not have trouble with comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options to enable or disable the compile time point with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the compile options certain depen@@ dencies must be fulfilled so that they can be used . for details , see the system requirements section .
activates Deb@@ ug@@ ging Symb@@ ols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; it can be set up without difficulty using the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
if the option is switched off , only the playlist window is displayed .
use V@@ oting bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches off the experimental function of the m@@ ood@@ bar .
design : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this changes the used color scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer .
ren@@ dition files to the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files will be stored on the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files will be stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets select which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok should be started when a browser is needed .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list .
save play@@ lists to exit , stores the current playlist automatically when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist when you exit .
relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to music files , starting from the location of the playlist , will be used . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
keep the current piece visible when changing parts , so that the playlist window will roll up / down to keep the current piece in the visible window area .
changing the context browser automatically shows the context browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can customize the look &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the section is divided into three parts .
in the font section , you can select the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok . by marking your own fonts use the otherwise gray outlined section . you can select fonts for the following area : play@@ lists window , player windows and context browser . click Select ... , so you can select a desired font from the drop @-@ down dialog .
with the Sel@@ ection color scheme you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . to do so , use the color selection activated , for foreground and background color .
playback at start means that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start playback automatically continues with the piece in the place with which it was stopped at the last stop .
set up the on @-@ screen display panel allows you to turn on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is attached , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select the desired font for the O@@ SD from the dialog . the check box shadows causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors gives you the option to adjust the O@@ SD colours for writing and background . a click on the color areas will open the dialog for color selection . if your own colors are not enabled , the default colors will be used ; colors will be used .
the Display Text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering space holders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your own needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the Display option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users , so you can specify on which screen a multiple monitor environment should appear on the O@@ SD .
the card @-@ card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers still activate other settings in this flash@@ card .
the card bundle collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok , to search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes for setting how to process with the selected folders .
Browse recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to browse both the selected and their sub@@ folders for music .
monitoring changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok to monitor the selected folders for changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import Play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to add all found play@@ lists to your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the play@@ lists added automatically appear later in the playlist browser .
the collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the drop down sel@@ ector driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setup is required in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l device section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; on calcul@@ ator : will enter the computer on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that the network port is entered , under which the database is reachable . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data required for connection to the database .
the last@@ .@@ f@@ m file card provides support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and if necessary create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send played pieces and so update the profile : this setting makes it possible &amp; Amar@@ ok to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
retrieve similar interpre@@ ters : after activating this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters to the played piece . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok needed only the package k@@ deli@@ bs and no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the included programs , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; needed some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) .
some functions such as the O@@ SD require that your window manager stick to the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ k@@ top@@ .org . so Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will cause difficulties , for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these provide an excellent development environment .
you can locate the file by browsing in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bu@@ g@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also app@@ end the broken file that caused the crash .
it is mostly due to the fact that tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a little more mature .
make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries with the same comp@@ iler version have been compiled . if , for example , comp@@ iles with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag Li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when editing the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d , then disable automatic switch off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail will automatically open in case of a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed .
this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ information , but do not mark them as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script resol@@ ves the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l &quot; &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : m@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : m@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : m@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( Rand@@ om mode / repetition / dynamic play@@ lists ) always look actively in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the icons are simply forgotten . this can be remedi@@ ed in the Control Centre under Ap@@ pear@@ ance Symb@@ ols . please note that in some cases , you have to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : symbol look@@ up error : symbol look@@ up error : symbol look@@ up error : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ system@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library .
to fix this bug , you may need to remove any conflic@@ ting Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok finds the correct version first .
most installation problems are most easily explained by the help of an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in Channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to look for help . please insert only one error , if you have something about fixing a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only appears an empty playlist . how do music pieces come in there ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the start sub@@ window was converted to the Statistics window . you can find it under Extras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars represent the evaluation by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
to evaluate plays , the evaluation columns must be displayed in the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and select column Show review . click anywhere in the new application column to specify the score for one piece . you can also use the Quick @-@ Command Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press Del@@ ete on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your selection and then select from the drop down menu from the drop down menu .
drag a playlist file to the playlist and drop it there exactly as you would do with other files . that &apos;s easy : - )
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the toolbar of the playlist , next to the Add button , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Play@@ list &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button can be saved . click on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
probably the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config is missing . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
none . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one of the back@@ end @-@ independent approach so the actual question must be Which media types supports G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support pretty much any imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and P@@ NG !
it may ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which the default does not include an MP3 decoder ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat , mp3 k@@ de , Enter key
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s : - )
if you are using the Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you search for the problem matter and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to specify another ink ( e.g. , sink ) .
this does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . do not forget that media must first be deco@@ ded . you can not just send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would just hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , deco@@ ded it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also deco@@ ded the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just as x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound servers with highest priority ( real time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia code@@ cs that can cause distorted playback . read this error report . to enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either you do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia completely to get the faster Arts Code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been heavily optimized for analy@@ zers ) , or decrease the size of the Arts Bu@@ ffer in Control Centre and Sound &amp; Multimedia , Sound System . the smaller the buffer , the less frequent the visu@@ aliz@@ ations react . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes and Amar@@ ok . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you will need to register all the components . register to register all the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t work , you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( quit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download as a system administrator and once as your normal user . then delete all the ff@@ m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module folder ( you will find the module folder with the command @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it again . now start &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
if you have a whole list of suggestions / wishes please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .

thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm run this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command leaves &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you wake up from the soft tones of music that you have stopped before going to bed .
how to find the currently in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running titles when you are on a different computer ?
if a working SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the running piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usability nam@@ e@@ Amar@@ ok player now@@ even
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes that your identification is present in ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . press D on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size .
the combination of C@@ trl + Right mouse button puts a piece in the click sequence into the queue . by pressing the Enter key after a search in the playlist , the first search result will be played and the search returned .

basically , this fits the previous evaluation with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the play has been played . the more often the play has been played , the less influence each individual rating has on the overall result .
you can add the rating for one piece by clicking with the right mouse button on a column header in the play@@ lists pane . there , you can change the evaluation of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by clicking with the right mouse button on the piece and press Edit : selecting rating or pressing F@@ 2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the Met@@ adata dialog .
the developers do not want you to tell you when to release a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed publication plan that is not to be combined with the short @-@ term fixed plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok which some users can also find ner@@ vi@@ g . disable the option icon while playing in the general settings .

if you want to use AL@@ SA then please the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have caused a lot of crashes and thus also a lot of error reports .
probably it was compiled and Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine did not compile these output modules . you need &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ?
you may need to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel package . the same also applies to x@@ ine , you must install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you must re@@ compile and install Amar@@ ok .

I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can Amar@@ ok use the second sound card ?
set under Settings Amar@@ ok ... Audio output , enter the device . typically , h@@ w : 0 is typical for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an on@@ board AC@@ 97 code@@ c and a USB audio device :
p@@ c@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
in the x@@ ine setup dialog , enter us@@ b @-@ audio and output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of sample rate , channels and so on .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , des@@ elect the check@@ box on sound card supports m@@ map .

the Play@@ list window can be split into two main sections , the left @-@ hand side is the navigation pane . in the navigation pane , you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . on the right , you find the playlist itself .
the context browser displays various information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be adapted using context browser designs . the context browser contains three sub @-@ windows : music , text and interpreter . these three sub@@ windows will be explained in detail later .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you might notice that the start window has dropped off . the information presented here has now been distributed in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the information can also be viewed in the Statistics window ( Extras statistics ) .
the music sub@@ window displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the interpreter and the album .
the first section in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . among them you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Co@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to track the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
see here how often and when the play was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
to show cover images in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ ng are supported . the file formats can have any name , but pictures with the word front in the name are treated prefer@@ enti@@ ally .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on any of these pieces , it will be played instantly .
among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this performer . this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current performer .
you can set which information should be displayed in the music sub@@ window . right @-@ click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work out and you will see the contents of the album .
you can click on any of the pieces in the individual fields to start playing immediately . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is running , you can choose which to start .
the Edit button enables you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s collection database . no running text script is needed for this .
the Search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Artist - groups only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or genres are ignored .
group@@ ing Artist / Album - First the pieces are arranged according to the interpreter and below it is performed a further split by the respective album . if you want to see compil@@ ations or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Vari@@ ous Interpre@@ ts .
group@@ ing Artist / Year - Album - Sor@@ ted to Interpre@@ t and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related .
group@@ ing Album - All the albums of your collection are displayed in alphabetical order and the interpreter is ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - your pieces will appear first sorted by genre and then by interpreter .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works just like the above , but is also sorted by album below the artist .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adapt and combine the group@@ ing as you like .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically collect your collection once you change something on the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , this might take a while .
directly below the tool bar there is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . hints for using this filter can be found in the section to the playlist in this manual .
under the search filter you find a selection box with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . you can also select different time windows , starting from the last 24 hours to a year . in addition , you can of course select your entire collection , so that the filter is switched off practically .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will receive the following options .
load - This will empty the current playlist and add the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play .
attach to playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on one entry , you will achieve the same effect .
tune the pieces in the queue - This function will add the selected pieces to the queue . this will play you next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as play@@ lists . you will be asked for a name under which the list should be stored .
to transfer the pieces to the Media Player , add the pieces to the Media Player . for more details , see the section on the Media Player browser .
burn all pieces of this performer / burn to CD - This will cause the selected pieces to be sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - opens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) Modi@@ fy files in the du@@ st@@ bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
marking as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation , and it appears in various interpre@@ ters .
dig@@ ging up a compilation flag - Chan@@ ges a selected album back into a normal album . after that , the album is no longer listed under Vari@@ ous performers but again under the respective interpreter .
the play@@ lists browser makes it easy to handle many play@@ lists . among other things , it also contains intelligent play@@ lists .
the bottom part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click Add Smart playlist to open the dialog to create a new Smart playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the Media Player sub@@ window is used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , using your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod by performer sorted in the top list view of the media player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the required titles from the playlist and drop them to the Interpre@@ t list . if you are done , click Apply . this will upload the pieces to your iPod . if the transfer is completed , quit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and release the drive binding for your iPod .
under the toolbar you find a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can get music from a given URL . if you type tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press Enter , you can listen to music in the musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z file . now you can drag the music from there into the playlist and drop .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files by simply dropping can be difficult . in this case the holding of the Shift key can be helpful : in this case dropped files are automatically inserted at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
the playlist contains all the pieces attached to play . you can change the order by simply drag the entries into the desired place and drop . as soon as you enter letters , only the pieces that contain the characters will be displayed . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again .
if you enter del@@ im@@ ited search terms by whit@@ esp@@ ace , &amp; Amar@@ ok , search for entries that contain all search terms . for example , if you enter one two , the search will find all entries containing one , two and three .
if you enter OR between the search terms OR searches for entries that contain either the one or the other search term . for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) are found .
if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then en@@ close the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this is the search for entries that Mike Old@@ field contains , but not for entries like Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for bigger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ th This searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign before the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain something .
you can combine these syntax variations as you like . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this looks for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bath .
you can set the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ trl key , and then click the entries with the right mouse button . the entries will then receive a label with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some features of the playlist . on the left , you will find the Add button to add the playlist to the playlist .
next , the buttons follow und@@ o and restore , so you can und@@ o or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the tool bar is a unique , magni@@ fied analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer .
the last button in the toolbar is menu . it opens the same menu as that which you can see in the player window over the right mouse button . on this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
there are many more buttons available for the toolbar , such as ren@@ dition checks and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and setting up tool@@ bars ...

you can also hide the status bar . disable the status bar option in the General Settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the menu in the playlist . using this menu , you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok ;

the cover management contains a list view of all the albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the artist on the left side .
with the View menu , you can choose what should be displayed in the cover management . select from :
the queue management got your big move in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this function you have even more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece into the queue , the playlist will appear next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will be played : 1 will be played first , 2 as second , and so on .

c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program to read digital audio from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent free and professional technology for audio encoding and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and encoder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ 2 decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported .
L@@ ame : a far developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 En@@ co@@ der module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : more libraries for processing different audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg , for example , it is possible to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files and then burn them to an audio CD .
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ x Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
Trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a feature full featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level , e.g. to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the unusual effect that the music pieces are reproduced differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to be able to start from CD and automatically play all the videos in the basic folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project .
saves the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name .
saves the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is displayed , with which you can select folders and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each single project file saving .
closes the current project . if a project has been changed and not yet saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; what should happen . you can then disc@@ ard between saving and changes . furthermore , you can cancel the closing and keep the project open .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project what to do with it , just as if you had called for each project file C@@ lose .
closes all opened projects and finishes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project , you will be asked what should happen , as if you called a file C@@ lose .
when you visit this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . that has the same effect as when you move the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the files added in the basic folder of the CD appear .
this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button firing , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; the burning dialog can only be opened when the project already contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described by the What is that ? ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful when you compile files for a multi @-@ session CD . the data from the previous session is always included , even if this function is not used .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removes no files from the medium , it only dis@@ closes the previously imported files .
this also allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a CD which you can then burn later on . besides , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of a normal copy . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
alternatively , you can only create an image of a DVD that you can then burn later . furthermore , the converting / inde@@ xing of a DVD with the help of the copy dialog is not yet supported , so the target medium has to be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form .
open the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the whole content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
open the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , which will delete the content completely . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the write modes Over@@ write and incre@@ mental .
the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a source of data that can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ o * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burn button .
a previously used DVD @-@ Video can be converted . this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings , and even possibilities for changing the size and cutting black edges .
displays information about the inserted media . this information is displayed in the content view and contains properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is enabled , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
if the view is enabled , its contents will be displayed in the table of contents . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locking and blocking of the drive or ej@@ ection of the medium .
the content view enables you to select and drag files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive was selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in folder view .
the header is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header bar has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the view .
this opens a dialog box to change the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key assignments for it further down .
this starts k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct auth@@ oriz@@ ations to burn CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator privileges are required , so you must enter the system administrator &apos;s password when starting the wizard .
open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work strai@@ gh@@ ta@@ way . this dialog is intended for person@@ alization and fine adjustment of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . using this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled , for example , via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functionality , so your taste and nature of your task is key in addition to which of the programs you prefer .
in this chapter , we assume you use the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program have in common , supported &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P @-@ interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and other functions for creating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ D@@ Project ( ) void copy@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then get a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface , which can only be applied to data @-@ projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ string Transpar@@ ent ) void add@@ ur@@ l ( K@@ URL : : list ur@@ ls , Q@@ string Transpar@@ ent ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string N@@ ames ) void set@@ Volume id ( Q@@ string id )
this makes it possible to complete a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then inserts files into the new folders :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT scan ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; reader for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it can easily be read audio CD ; s can be read out and stored in MP3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard drive ) and by many enco@@ ders who enco@@ ded these wa@@ v files ( these enco@@ ders must still be installed from the Linux distribution ) .
first the title of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these wa@@ v files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or in other formats like loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . all of these programs are generally available for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is very likely not necessary to compile anything yourself .
which encoding / file format should be used ? chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ver gives a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to crack any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device the protection surrounds , it is not possible to b@@ ypass the mechanism of copy protection . simply avoid buying copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up the setup dialog can only be done once ( but the setup dialog can be called as often until a suitable configuration is found ) , the daily handling of the reading of a &amp; CD will be explained . this will ( hopefully ) lead to an understanding of the lean approach of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert to many formats - depending on which enco@@ ders are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network , with everything manually collected .
this is just a short list of commands from the main window . step by step Ex@@ ample you will find more information about how this program is used as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of tabs for the configuration of the program .
starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD data according to the setup of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this may be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . )
start reading and - if a encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup index - encoding .
opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection can be read with another encoder than the standard . it must be noted that previously the encoder in the encoding settings tab has been configured in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager , so that an already loaded file for encoding is selected instead of a full &amp; CD ; to read and to code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( like En@@ co@@ der , to set up the encoder ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders , and compression ratios and helps you to choose the right encoder .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution .
under the audio formats that lost information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate differences are less important as both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless supplied free with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions
+ high up to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared with O@@ GG slightly lower quality at lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG recordings is available .
MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto @-@ stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has already quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a bit less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices require C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a song . good enough for music of teenagers , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the size of the file , choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is entered manually or retri@@ eved by the program from the fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / use it with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with encoding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ ders and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD ; add titles to the keywords ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title must be added by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs , so that all others can download this information instead of entering the computer . it is to be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , Artist , Name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( meaning the author ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; information that is publicly available on the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . any information can be obtained anyway with a stroll through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is actively an check box to select ( Send a address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b it can be used with another ( fake ) address as the data set up in the system . in this type of configuration , it seems , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( This can only know the programmer who reviewed the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if it is set up to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally located mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts .
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during the reading of a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which file program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more exactly , search in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CDs ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not yet happened .
to save the read WAV files , the encoder and the desired file format can be selected . at the first opening , pre @-@ defined l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) can be found on the tab to set the encoder . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the enco@@ ders package must be installed by the respective lin@@ ux distribution before the enco@@ ders can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined enco@@ ders . more information about enco@@ ders can be found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ver .
after installing a encoder , more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and write per@@ missions on it and if both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you don &apos;t want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything but are still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and our first &amp; CD ; read out . we &apos;ll use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) of 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) .
both programs should be installed as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found , for example , with a search engine , as it is considered as non @-@ free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can do of course .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission ( eg ; by trying to copy something into the kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic set up of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something that will probably only be done once and
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each output &amp; CD .
here we determine the enco@@ ders to be used for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) and the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it at any reading of a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name will be transferred to the reading program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your disk . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , you can also view the file / etc / f@@ stab and try with the entries of the device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the card @-@ card General Settings . here there is not much to do . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
select only if you have incomplete information , so that you will be informed when details about creating keywords ( tags ) are missing .
the card @-@ card CD ; -@@ Settings . just select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the internet while reading the &amp; CD , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection box is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found , immediately starts reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can easily be changed .
you can work with fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you download the database before . however , this is over 6@@ 20 MB big , consider this twice if this is worthwhile . to fre@@ ed@@ b in the offline mode , the two choices must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card .
CD@@ DB is for us fre@@ ed@@ b . these are settings for data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server over the internet . how does the system know what data the CD should be received ? read the fre@@ ed@@ b section .
mode : we did not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server near you . on this path the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work equally as far as the server is concerned , but since many fire@@ walls attempt to boot the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with protocol 80 , as the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example we do not want to send &amp; CD ; data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . disable the first check box should suff@@ ice .
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the / tmp directory does exist on your computer )
sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , therefore simply try it yourself .
CD ; disc@@ ard the last piece : tick this to the &amp; CD ; disc@@ ard at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must the path / folder where the wa@@ v files are stored . this can be useful if there is only space on another drive . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder .
enter everything in the same way as on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be brow@@ sed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is average about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; entry for restric@@ ting the generation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags may also be deleted if needed . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as shown in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneously enco@@ ded wa@@ v files : at a du@@ al@@ core or quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to code more than one wa@@ v file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we &apos;ve just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for any reading of a &amp; CD ; used . if you have wis@@ ely chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
in this section we describe how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; runs on the hard drive . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard drive , was written in the previous section and set up . first , a connection to the Internet is constructed as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b must be retri@@ eved .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from those for a &amp; CD ; with successfully fet@@ ched data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually , rather than pick it up from the Internet . comments will indicate the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; output of the author of this manual .
if this is not yet done , now the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as shown in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; can be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , look for the help section in the FAQ section , or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully fet@@ ched from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces have already been filled in and the name of the artist and the album are also displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; there , a window will be displayed , and you can select the database entry that best fits your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you do not select the check box for automatic retri@@ eval of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the toolbar . if you do not have a local database , but get the data from the Internet , you will need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD Editor - Input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer has to be entered in the &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; input field unless you have a collection of different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for individual comments ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ al per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words with capital letters begin or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any un@@ desirable comments .
note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum allowed . this option is set on the encoder settings section ; take a look at the &apos; Basic Settings &apos; section .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor at any time . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the help of the encoder to get more information .
simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the tap@@ ered CD ; in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , go back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the CD editor window appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current item .
click the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ; entered .
attention : this window does not appear if you download the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the piece list .
note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece on or off . make sure all pieces are selected , or press the All items button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once .
when you click on the button Select the selection selection process , this window will appear to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on .
click on the tab Order to switch to the job window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the tool bar .
this is the window for controlling orders . the first piece is just read out on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message appears when you try to work with a code that you haven &apos;t installed yet . pieces that have not been successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folders are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : assignment # 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . this allows you to read out and code parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that appears configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding . in the case of low @-@ performance machines , the result is unclear .
now the last song is read , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is placed in the queue of the encoder . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window with a message is displayed for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the encoder of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . however , most distri@@ butions already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is . install the k@@ de@@ multimedia package from your distribution .
this section is aimed at people compiled from source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different programs has many variants of settings . it &apos;s best to read the step by step , for example , to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen@@ shots of the various flash@@ cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the initial start of the program , without any reference point as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? who reads this has probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator . whoever wants to add or change something useful may do it . at least after cont@@ acting the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and is therefore in agreement with this proposal .
strange , if you have succeeded in getting the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these informations , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke player from &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of lyrics , he also has some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all O@@ SS and node systems ; &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as a sequ@@ encer is supported .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of any MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag and drop so that you can drag &amp; drop ; any MIDI file from one &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; drag windows to k@@ mid .
supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( rec@@ esses or tex@@ tual events ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the procedure used .
session support . when you finish playing a song , k@@ mid will start again next time with the same song .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it will pop up the usual file dialog with which help you can select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows in the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the toolbar , select the entry from the menu item , or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece will automatically start as soon as you drag it onto the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( in several pieces it will be added to a collection and then played one after the other . )
once you play a piece , you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and moving back and forth with the knob .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows on the left and right of the Tem@@ po@@ Check to change the playing speed . to get back the original speed , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar acts like pressing the button Pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu , thus interrup@@ ts the play . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in one piece of music in two ways . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and others use both . some pieces do not have a text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined which uses a song , so you don &apos;t have to manually set the automatic text selection . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set an event type , select the entries and / or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you put together . these are played back in series . in this section you can see how you can efficiently use collections .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you can find it in the menu Collection below the item Organ@@ ize .... Click New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copy and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original ones .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the desired items in the collection manager .
the temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection is not saved . remember that if you add lots of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the Collection Manager . there , you can add a song using the Add button . again , the file dialogue appears , with which help you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on setting Automati@@ cally add to the collection .
when automatic add to the collection is enabled , a piece will automatically be added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Drag &amp; Drop ) .
if Automati@@ cally add to the collection is not enabled , when opening a piece , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then be added to the pieces that are still open .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the sub@@ menu of the player sequence of the menu collections , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the Collection Manager , or use the drop @-@ down menu above the kar@@ aoke text .
to skip a song , select the Next song button , select next song from the menu item or press the button arrow to the right .
to jump back a song , select the button Previous piece , the entry Previous piece from the menu item or press the button arrow on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter because it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map transl@@ ates general @-@ MIDI events into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map , which converts all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and can therefore always be heard when playing a piano .
if you only have one sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI map because all the sound cards are GM compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI maps . so you need to edit the appropriate file manually ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all necessary settings for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once except the Key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , it is necessary for each occurrence to have different text id ( see below ) .
def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Name of the Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Ano@@ ther Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as email so I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
in this section you specify how the patches of General MIDI are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the equ@@ ation sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and also leave no row for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to set the sound with the number M on the sound . if your keyboard doesn &apos;t support a gun ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun . to do this , enter the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if now a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes Patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here is the term drum patch of the patch , where every sound is a different percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where the sound is the pitch of the always same drum ( as some key@@ boards have it ) .
the Key@@ map section is used to specify how tones are m@@ apped to a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important as well as their presence . so you must create 128 entries .
you can define multiple key@@ maps for each channel and instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ maps are used mainly to map sounds on the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel . look at the provided key@@ maps as an example .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swap the first and the second channel , just make it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however these settings are more useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a particular channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section therefore has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel which is m@@ apped to the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map with the name name is needed for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events that attempt to change the patch on this channel will be ignored .
for example , the For@@ ce@@ Patch can be useful to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates in what ratio P@@ itch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch Ben@@ der event with the value n , it is converted to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used to prevent dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is used because GM pre@@ tends that a pitch Ben@@ der event is supposed to play a pitch higher with the value 40@@ 96 . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards attempt to play two tones up to one oc@@ tave up . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , just open the MIDI Settings dialog . you can find it in the Settings menu , point MIDI Settings
the channel view is a window with a whole row of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you can see which sounds are played straight .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button lights no more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( up to now ) two different views to display the played sounds . view the View menu in the Settings menu under the Point Channel view : settings
the speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . for example , if you find a song too fast to follow the lyrics , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc ; that the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
well , I can &apos;t force anyone to use k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; it has been compiled without AW@@ E support . to remove the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos; s start page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I do not want to add all files individually .
OK , therefore supported &amp; k@@ mid ; drag and drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
check the Auto Add to Collection previously . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default tempo , you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( when I play a MIDI file ) or attached ( when I play a kar@@ aoke file ) or I want to play a file , just change to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; drag .
if you only want to listen to a file quickly without adding it to a collection , turn the setting Automati@@ cally add to the collection , and the new ; file is added to the temporary collection .
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . First you only want to play the first file . so , set the Automatic Add to Collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection will then contain exactly this one MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , that anim@@ ates me to continue programming .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ se@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; laga ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the university of Ma@@ acute ; laga . currently I am in the third year , so I do not have much leisure time for my hob@@ bies but I try to take a bit of time .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files if you have a question , an error or an idea for an expansion of &amp; k@@ mid ; or if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ pink @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es
if you send me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will count among friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; if you want to send a MIDI file , you should contact me , since I may already have the file .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid , completely written in my spare time , and no one has gotten money on it . I would like to stress that I can only be more program@@ matic because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch was too high for AW@@ E cards .

and of course , my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the web , who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition , it can be found on his homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rac@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ pink / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , search for information and look at pictures . you will also find links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , since the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same if you are using a FM radio device or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid with the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ C@@ U@@ AL parameter . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can &apos;t listen to music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Ma@@ iling lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ on@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as to play DVD &apos;s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ end ; it was not finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE Website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Ma@@ iling list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . alternatively , there is the window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that is displayed only when information is returned .
it is possible to save the preferred links under the book@@ marks menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category of continuous play@@ lists .
of course , you can add groups to groups to create an additional hierarch@@ ical level . if you click on an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and the playback begins with the cli@@ cked entry .
the different files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / , can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . simply click on a name of a category to select from the View menu and next editing mode . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , you have to choose play@@ lists from the playlist and choose either the editing mode or select another category .
all changes are lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without using the playlist .
as a result of the ease of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; some features can only be activated by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation for starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ layer err@@ c and modify &#91; General Options &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 ob@@ lige option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during startup does not need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . however , this would be disturbing at the end animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite picture : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; body ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ tra radius &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; &amp; lt ; / stat@@ s ; &amp; lt ; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; &amp; lt ; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; &amp; lt ; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; &amp; lt ; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; &amp; lt ; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; &amp; lt ; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; &amp; lt ; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; &amp; lt ; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; &amp; lt ; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f .
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; button in the toolbar of K@@ M@@ Player . here is the output of mp@@ layer .
there is no tab for this ren@@ dition in the Con@@ figuration dialog from &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manual editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ layer err@@ c , just like setting the back@@ end via mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example how a &apos; flash &apos; is played with the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even insert the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
to use the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; module must be specified as service provider for the Mim@@ e @-@ type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file assignments of K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is in a console application to start and search for error messages concerning loading the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end issue is within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to check ) .
to always use a given back@@ end for a particular mim@@ e type ( of course , only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ layer err@@ c . for example , Ph@@ on@@ on should play all o@@ gg files :
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either using a M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be watched , the device to be used and the TV channels need to be configured . to do this , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure the V@@ DR ( video data recorder ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player is the dialog in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there , ports should be detected , one of which is selected . the code to be used must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b in it .
since the V@@ DR support of K@@ M@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension must be functional for the X server . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must contain the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
internally by K@@ M@@ Player , different names are used for the sources . at the time of the creation of this documentation , this is dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , ver@@ source , pi@@ pes@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if enabled , they start playing the playlist .
is there any way I can make my CD@@ ROM volume qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command HD@@ PAR@@ M -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is the root user to run the device . it is absolutely necessary to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom drives on the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine only starts up slowly , why must my CPU be tested for its performance every time ?
note : the answer is over@@ taking . k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer will automatically need the last stored value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

G@@ opher initially started as a distributed campus information system at the University of Minn@@ es@@ ota . G@@ opher allows the user to access information that is found on G@@ opher servers on the Internet .
G@@ opher allows the user to store the position of a desired information in a book@@ mark . thus , the user can get directly to the information using the book@@ mark without having to browse the entire menu . G@@ opher menu is not standardized so that any G@@ opher server holds certain information .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is used to compile &amp; dump ; needed .
latex ; : a professional typ@@ es@@ etting application . Unix @-@ like systems will probably rely on the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD should be used .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; -@@ Project contains some already compiled packages from &amp; Ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; -@@ website .
this manual is for everyone - independent of the experiences with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users hardly have to read this manual . however , all the suggestions for documentation should be considered . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , contact via the box should be established .
if you have any questions or if you want to compile &amp; dump , please refer to the ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net mailing list .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides the opportunity to use all natural latex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , direct and tailored access to all &amp; latex ; -@@ programs . furthermore , the possibility to complete , compile , re@@ work and troubleshooting within the source code as well as conversion and view tools for this . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wizard , the &amp; latex ; reference and powerful project management must be called .
to learn more about posters and its features , the manual should be consul@@ ted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start reading the chapter &apos;s work with the editor of &amp; kate .
for &amp; latex ; is the correct language : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use can also use a lay@@ man ( engl@@ .@@ lay ) &amp; latex ; -@@ mac@@ ros . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it comes from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while there is only one good overview of latex ; given , it is not the ultimate book . to be able to control properly , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
the introduction contains at least the command \ \ document@@ class , the body begins with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } .
the quick entry Assistant from &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for the quick creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) provides some options for creating the document . you can also make some adjustments to the document .
document classes : this defines the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; read &#93; , report &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , fo@@ ils &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user defined .
encoding : this is used to set the character encoding . modern systems increasingly use U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for the correct processing of the latex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ on packages for natural latex ; for the integration , they only need to be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( compl@@ ying with German DIN regulations ) . they should always be used in the compilation of German texts .
new users have no need to worry about this . it is merely a brief description of the functions and further information is given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - just like other source text editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; if you want to see larger areas of a green text on the screen , it is very likely that some mathematical environment is not closed .
with the automatic completion of the environment , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; dump ; automatically generates a blank line ( for entering the text ) and the corresponding line for the command of the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be de@@ activated in the menu settings Ki@@ le ; La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually divided into a few elements . &amp; latex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most common and sub@@ paragraph the bottom element ) :
in view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse .
when creating your own &amp; latex ; files can be very helpful with a click with the middle mouse button in DVI ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the appropriate line in the &amp; latex ; source text .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and other information such as the font and is next to PDF the standard output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the check @-@ up search , the elements of the DVI ; file are linked to the editor and once cli@@ cked on an element in the DVI ; file , the corresponding section in the &amp; latex ; source text is cli@@ cked .
master document : this function is used for working with multiple files . with a master document , work with other embedded .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project settings .
fast Construction : the &amp; latex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there are any errors in the source code ) .
file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file will be &quot; w@@ aking over &quot; in no time , no call from &amp; oc@@ cul@@ ars ; after the fast construction .
when viewing the Edit tool bar , the three large selection fields should be visible . the selection fields have been developed for the quick classification of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; latex ; -@@ instructions for the sub@@ division are :
the other selection box is for inser@@ ting items such as keywords , no@@ des or references . the available options are :
name : this command will create a name for a section , a picture or a different item .
reference : is used for reference to a specified term ( selection via a selection box possible ) .
the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; manually .
the last drop @-@ down box with the name Gra@@ y is used for the definition of the font . it can be set the characters for the main text , the verti@@ ces , etc . the following fonts are available :
when calling &amp; Ki@@ le , there are two choices available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting document type and setting the settings .
the brackets after the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . the &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; set defines the font size . if font size is not set at the beginning , this can also be done later in the text .
once the source code above has been entered , the &amp; latex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the Men@@ ue building or the quick @-@ release button .
the source code must be saved prior to comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; it automatically extracts the file .
if the comp@@ iling of the document fails , it should be searched for errors in the logging process . when using Fast@@ ening should &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be observed .
an environment is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size 12 is created and only a few columns should have a different font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } will then have the validation of the let@@ tering within the environment .
the changes are only over@@ done within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } . there is no nar@@ rowing ( number ) for changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the legi@@ bility and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , you can add certain fonts , bold prints , cur@@ sive prints , sub@@ titles , etc . these commands either end with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for recur@@ sive expression and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or any other environment .
\ \ quote : creates a quotation in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
after the background to writing the source code with the &amp; latex ; mark@@ up language was presented , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step instructions for creating a document in &amp; dump ; .
as soon as a bit of text was entered in the wizard , some adjustments should be made for the better read@@ ability of the document . at least one quotation , a few passages in bold and ital@@ ics , and a poem should be used to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , the editor view or C@@ trl @-@ E can be converted back to the editor ( internal viewer ) .
once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try out and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file , the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file was created from the &amp; latex ; source code , the conversion into desired other formats can begin by means of the buttons in the toolbar .
the pre @-@ search request allows direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position inside the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a suitable setting for all &amp; latex ; - bin@@ aries . for this purpose only Modern can be set up under Settings ...
to select the preferred search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source text and then cli@@ cked on for pre @-@ search . the jump to the corresponding location in DVI ; the viewer is then taken .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the respective &amp; latex ; -@@ document by &amp; Ki@@ le ; opened and jump@@ ed to the appropriate line . to do this , &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; set as text editor ( Set@@ ting up ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
if you don &apos;t open the &amp; DVI , you can have an error . if there is an error , it will be displayed in the log file or in the message window .
the log file lists the source text error source . in the editor , the buttons Previous La@@ Te@@ X errors and Next La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used between the errors . the log file always specifies the line in which the error appears . to view the defective line , it must be cli@@ cked on the error in the logging and &amp; dump ; jump to the incorrect line .
once cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the toolbar , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document . the default options are :
when selecting an empty document , a document can either be re@@ written either from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document . more information can be found in the section .
H@@ Ã ¤ u@@ fi@@ ge users of &amp; latex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be stored in &amp; dump ; created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file must be opened or a new file must be created . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template using an existing document and selecting File Tem@@ plate from document ...
when creating a new document from a file called New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set in Settings boxes ... settings can be set .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are sub@@ stituted by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is sub@@ stituted by entering the document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { items } .
the easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created this way , the following steps must be executed :
when creating a new document , its own template can then be selected instead of the standard one .
a template can be created from any &amp; latex ; a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the internet and the steps described above are searched .
&amp; Po@@ sters ; used as an internal editor . &amp; Po@@ sters ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility to read and emphasize many different types of text files ( including &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . lots of settings for &amp; kate .
to learn more about posters and its possibilities , the manual should be consul@@ ted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can begin there directly with reading the chapter &apos;s work with the editor of &amp; kate .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a very practical &amp; latex ; command reference which can be called via the menu help La@@ Te@@ X Reference . it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands which can be found in &amp; latex ; and its syntax .
double click with C@@ trl key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that by clicking on \ \ par \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ par \ \ par \ par .
when dra@@ gging the text with left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with a pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editing pane .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to search for different kinds of source texts and emphasize them . for example , the natural latex ; -@@ commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color .
many assistants can add additional jump marks . this is a special type of book@@ mark within the text . the menu entries Edit boun@@ ce brands or the corresponding keys allow the jump to the next or last jump mark . this is also highlighted by this jump mark , so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character .
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; Ki@@ le ; though &amp; makes ; already excellent possibilities , were added in &amp; dump ; important functions for writing a &amp; latex ; source code is always added ; special commands for their selection . under Edit Select the following commands for selecting text :
he@@ ats a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing an empty line on both sides ) . this extended meaning does not include tables , &amp; latex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . the only bent thing in &amp; dump ; is that the paragra@@ phs are separated by two blank lines .
choose the word under the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning since this command also provides &amp; latex ; -@@ commands with a return line ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
for listening to a part of the document , it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; Po@@ sters ; offers the key C@@ trl ; K with which the whole line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers with own commands here for a faster possibility . under Edit Rem@@ ove the following commands to delete the text are included :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is included in the description to Edit Select In@@ serts paragraph .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; for further orders under Edit surroundings for a very simple work with &amp; latex ; .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to lie@@ g the environment .
if the cursor is located before or within the \ \ begin { environment } command , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted environment commands , the overview can be lost quickly . this command completes the recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure is not destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; latex ; groups which are determined by bra@@ ces { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that correspond to those from the environment .
with this command you jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the cur@@ v@@ ented clasp .
if the cursor is located before or behind the bra@@ ced bracket of a &amp; tex ; group # , jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
with the input of many ne@@ sted , bra@@ zed groups @-@ clas@@ ps , the overview can be lost quickly . this command completes the last opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups is not destroyed .
in &amp; latex ; two simple quotation marks are used as a seal . for the beneficial implementation it is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the mark &quot; is used for two simple quotation marks . also for the end of the mark the mark &quot; is used . &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and adds two final touch marks for natural latex ; one .
this automatic insert of the double quotation marks can be set under settings Ki@@ le ... La@@ Te@@ X can be turned on and off .
you can also use dic@@ tion@@ able settings ( e.g. German or French ) , and therefore German or French call marks . there are also many other languages available .
when pressing Shift key ; enter &amp; tilt ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is located within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not only a new@@ line but at the same time the command \ \ item .
within a table environment U &amp; Ki@@ le , the current line begins with \ \ \ \ with a line break .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pres@@ et &amp; latex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be set under Settings Ki@@ le ; set ... La@@ Te@@ X added .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables environments and all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) each other . &amp; Ki@@ le ; tries to make this possible . while pressing Shift + Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; boxes ; after the next tab in the upper row .
although &amp; Po@@ sters ; already offering a good source code completion , this has been expanded in &amp; Ki@@ le ; three different modes are installed . three of them are working on demand and the other two are for automatic execution . all of these modes can be set up for different ways of working under Settings ... Compl@@ et@@ ely adjusted .
at the beginning a new environment is started by the command \ \ begin { environment } &amp; dump ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input is removed and thus the complete list of characters is possible . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are removed from the selection of a command . alternatively , jump marks can be inserted , so that a simple jump to these positions can be possible using the jump @-@ mark N@@ Ã ¤ th@@ est jumping mark and the desired parameters can then be added .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; set up ... boxes ; complete settings can be made to these lists . you can select different wish lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands as well as library books of the general language use .
the command mode is not useful for the completion of environments . there must always be a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the invo@@ king of the completion mode will result in a large list of environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are so often used that &amp; dump ; a special mode for completing the environments .
when calling the finishing mode over the menu edit environment or but@@ ton@@ key Alt + Shift key , the command to run the environment is automatically frozen and it appears \ \ begin { . afterwards , the environment can be continued in the simplest way and ended by pressing the input key .
once this has been completed , the environment will be automatically closed again . as soon as &amp; Ki@@ le ; realize that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be added .
under Settings box ; set up ... boxes ; complete settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of complete termination mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; supports custom lists of back@@ ups that are immediately replaced by older strings . the lists can be set up under Settings boxes ... boxes can be set up . as an example of a drop @-@ down list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word processing mode is initiated over the Edit menu or the keyboard C@@ trl + Alt spac@@ eb@@ ar , the letter L is replaced by the character string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large qui@@ vers are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been found that many kill@@ ers are written more than once in a document .
this mode can be set up in the menu settings ... boxes can be destroyed . here , the threshold value can also be specified for the display of the completion .
the complete files can be installed in the folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Ki@@ le / complete / mode / the Per@@ s@@ Ã ¶ n@@ lichen Home folder . mode stands for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( W@@ ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
the dialog box displays graphics as easy as possible . to over@@ view the basics to the graphic formats , the sections should be considered and noted .
PS files are not as well @-@ known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
in order to examine the result of the work , the source code must be compiled . all building tools are compiled in groups in the creation , compilation and creation view .
for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used the keyboard individual Alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI ; file can be viewed in the default viewer using Alt ; 3 , using Alt ; 4 , the DVI ; file can be viewed in a PS file and by means of Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the quick @-@ release command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no embedded viewer is used , a new window will be opened every time .
a new project is about the Men@@ Ã ¼ projekt Neues Projekt .... Hier@@ bei the following information is requested for the project :
when filling the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the script &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Ki@@ le &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; script ; allows the execution of EC@@ MA@@ Script codes . the scripts can be managed through scripts in the vertical bar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the API scripts are not yet finished and can be added to other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first it has to be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = ki@@ le ) has the following methods :
&amp; latex ; is a rather sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different aids for support of users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; they are supplied with many documents . this includes a documentation for the included packages and a further &amp; latex ; reference .
this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) , but rather it is a complete operating instructions for the &amp; latex ; it is therefore ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents provided with &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the finding of the right document is not always easy . as a possible help , &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k which contains a database with all to &amp; boxes ; delivered documents and this for a graphic surface area .
all documents are sub@@ divided into categories and the advantage is the search for package names or tags . from &amp; Ki@@ le ; only the results are displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or placing the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; latex ; - / tex ; source code editor that can be installed on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; - Work@@ space environment . &amp; Ki@@ le ; is also part of the Fink project , which makes &amp; Ki@@ le ; also on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X .

&amp; sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for emails . the signatures process you in the graphical user interface of &amp; k@@ sig ; with the command line interface , you create random signatures or day signatures from a list .
for random signatures , any signature is selected from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; by many signatures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information , you can make your e @-@ mails more varied and unique .
for day signatures the same signature is selected from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig for the whole day . for each day , use different signatures , as with the random signatures , create unique e @-@ mails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ trl ; N file New . this gives you an lt ; empty signature ; in the Sig@@ natures section . click on the &amp; lt ; empty signatures ; and add your new signature in the bottom section . signature example Kon@@ qi kon@@ qi @ k@@ de@@ .org ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ de@@ .org When you have entered your signature , please save it to C@@ trl ; S file , or click Save the disk icon .
you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always enough signatures .
to delete a signature , select it first and then remove from the File menu or click on the icon with the red cross Rem@@ ove in the toolbar .
here you can select short commands for menu entries . to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click the User Defin@@ ed button on the right @-@ hand side and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the button or key combination .
for the use of &amp; sticks ; is &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 required . to attach signatures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature text from the output of a command .
all stack elements are listed here . the older the stack entry is , the lower its frame number . see the example below .
clicking a call stack in the list shown will offset the cursor in the main window to the corresponding line number of the corresponding file .

the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all of these tools use com@@ man@@ ders as surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base . the combination yields fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows my pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . let &apos;s take it a bit , we give it a graphical interface ! no more dependent on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked the icon for the XML processor and done !
this application expects an inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is located in the desired folder , then leave the current work folder . if not , then remove the selection of current work folders and specify it in the other folder &apos;s field .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files will be deleted every time my pro@@ c is started .
as I said before , anyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; there is now a great graphical interface for that .
if the opened file is inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book , then just leave the current work folder . if not , then select the current work folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
when it comes to output on the screen , your file is faulty . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be checked is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then they simply hook up the current file . if not , they will delete the check@@ box in the current file and select the file to be scanned using a different file - file selection .
if you just want to know if the well @-@ formed file is , click the Well @-@ formed check option .
to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( default ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; file selection . both for the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema as well as for the Rel@@ ax review is the definition of definition UR@@ I ; file selection required .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has also a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is already selected , then it is easy to select the current file . if not , remove the selection from the current file and select the file to be processed using the other file &apos;s file selection .
enter the name of the file as the result should be named . the file is usually stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; invite , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly do little to do . this makes the plugin system very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone uses the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; plug@@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements .
to install a plugin or a part , we start with the Edit menu . this opens the following dialog :
this dialog allows you to manage all of the included plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to searching the plug @-@ in .
often on a project several people work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship with each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and is used for unique identification purposes .
a member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can select from the list of team members who he is . this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identification ) appears bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of your own identity are important in terms of news and comments . see for more information on comments .
apart from an overview of their team there is another advantage by capturing members of the team : an event that can be created for information to the team leaders when something specific happens . see in for more detailed information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific is happening in the project . an example would be recording the opening and closing of the project so that later you can see how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that takes a file to CVS as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipient list . the address can be a team or sub @-@ project leader . see how such conductors are set up .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
to enter comments is simple . either the note entry can be selected from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword can be entered in a comment area followed by comment text .
notes can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case , the syntax is @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , with nick@@ name being the nick@@ name of the team member .
nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that is an agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings can be reached via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found .
the settings can be set up by means of Settings Qu@@ anta ... This dialog covers a number of pages which are treated consec@@ u@@ tively .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including auto completion can be changed . the entries are :
large / lo@@ wer@@ case of tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal / lo@@ wer@@ case means the tags are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tag@@ r@@ XML files .
large / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically added attributes . normal / lo@@ wer@@ case means that the attributes are inserted in such a way as they are described in the XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if checked , for tags , for which the closing tag is optional , this will be inserted immediately after &amp; gt ;
do not include optional tags automatically : as above for all other tags except for simple tags .
automatically update the start and finish day : if enabled , the corresponding closing tag is changed and vice versa .
automatic creation of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding encoding while typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for the detection of different types of files . the default settings can be restored using the Def@@ ault button .
standard character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file Open opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D was not recognized . however , this setting will be affected by the same in the project features if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates backup copies on a regular basis , so that during a power failure or crash at the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . even for un@@ saved documents , a backup is created regularly according to the set time .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in your own view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and source text at the same time .
reset the window settings to the default back at the next start is useful when the user interface is confused by changing the M@@ DI Mo@@ di and and@@ o@@ cken / depen@@ dencies of views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameter .
the warning message area is used to control the possibility of switching warnings from non @-@ poll@@ uting al@@ erts .
the location to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source @-@ text view in shared mode .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the representation of par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be set into details .
in the mouse click on the structure tree the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the Stru@@ cture @-@ Tree @-@ Settings section , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the updating frequency of the tree when editing and how deep when changing the structure tree is to be opened automatically . empty no@@ des are the empty spaces in the text while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document .
short@@ cuts are group@@ ed into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ cation short abbrevi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript .
here the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug@@ ins are K@@ Part applications from third party , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be stated :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located at a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; load &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Read Only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; read @-@ only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; parts normally refuse loading if this option is not selected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the information entered is correct . choose to save the item even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting has been completely re@@ developed . the support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger has been set , as well as support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger .
currently only one plugin is available , supporting the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin sel@@ ector , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface :
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view in which all holding points are listed with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , or it tells the plugin to listen to de@@ bug requests . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , which uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so normally it does not have to be taken care of .
the counterpart to de@@ bu@@ gging session starts the session . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the listening according to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and running information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens , while the script is stopped , the execution will continue .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to over@@ saw variables and the current line number . if this happens , while a script is stopped , the execution continues .
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next statement in the script without going into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next statement in the script , where possible in functions and include is corrected .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the statement and proceed to the next as if there were no current ones .
opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set .

this chapter describes how you can &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; adapt to your needs and how you can and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; help to become better .
document type editing packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . they allow &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; their simplicity and flexibility makes aus &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; their simplicity and flexibility makes aus &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or &amp; CSS ; . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two parts , the tag folder and the tool bar . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool bar . tag folders are handy , symbolic boxes of picture buttons ( above the editing window ) , which insert text and instructions more quickly into a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool bar . in short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day . the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow a quick insertion of tags into a document without risk of sp@@ elling error .
tag folders are nothing but folders . they only contain the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders carry the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the tagged XML and declares whether they are necessary , or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information in working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and limits is presented in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but it contains nothing else than just element type .
the type of tag is a script function . when used , att@@ r &gt; is an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only for the class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family only )
applies only to the type method . specifies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family only 2 )
if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text into the dialog . this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
this element can only occur once for each attribute . it sets the name and type of the attribute . in addition , it contains additional tags describing how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a single element type element .
specifies the source code used to fill in the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag that group together the elements of a list . it can occur for an attribute description only once . it is an element type element .
defines the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this element is empty .
specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tag that is to be defined . this element is a single element type .
specifies a list of elements that termin@@ ate a tag . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; -@@ declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces do not affect anything , but be aware of &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; . to refrain from doing this will not cause a leg interruption , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is open at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear , whose simple instructions are to follow .
this function is currently not available . currently , it is only checked for loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the following is an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ day .
the following is an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .

the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for using DT@@ D edi@@ ts DT@@ D settings . with this , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = turn 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D statement . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with settings actions ... clicking on New action leads to the same dialog :
the short@@ cut assigned to this action . by clicking the user defined button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ one , the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the defined settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even the quick start dialog or the various see in ... actions for ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . This way tries to find the script at the following locations : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts in its path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name is removed .
% p@@ id : is replaced with P@@ GD of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text will be added unique to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above listed methods , a script input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus can be found at the default input . in the input box input can be determined what to send to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally only useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , to the standard error output . it can be specified , what should be done with the text written to the standard output by setting the input field output :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create an own toolbar for each group . in the given case , it is not too many , therefore you can create a toolbar with the name of the mark@@ up .
once a toolbar has been added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings to set actions .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts the editing mode .
fill in all necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; complete all and , if the tag has attributes and you plan their use , enable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edit Details &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dialog when available so that an input while using the action is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
und@@ o ! is this a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let us replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphi@@ c More Programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit Size .
please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the start of the tag , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually called los , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user will be indicated that clicking on this icon will be displayed &amp; lt ; tag in the current document .
after creating the symbol it still needs to be connected to the action . this happens via the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . in addition to the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the user button and continue with other tags , as there are still some , or confirm with OK to finish .
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; add functions to the toolbar or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview by some separ@@ ators .
after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the toolbar .
for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or Pre@@ view . I will select it and add it to the toolbar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new toolbar must be tested by hal@@ ving all the symbols to make sure everything works .
back up in the right folder . after re@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust their descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that their toolbar ( s ) will be loaded ( s ) when a file is opened by the respective type .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language that you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how to create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; repository if someone has done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / scrip@@ ting / etc ; -@@ language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , for example ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for these document@@ ations e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html ... &#91; Con@@ text &#93;
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see now in PHP &amp; PHP ; documentation like this :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x.@@ html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of the box ( except for reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
you notice that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces do not affect anything , but be aware of &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource files will be replaced .
the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file that is used to design context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function should be displayed . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( context list ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of context elements del@@ im@@ ited by under@@ score ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your file do@@ cr@@ c to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local and global usage . then create a folder ( as you specified it in your do@@ cr@@ c file ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation to it .
if you are sure that these are good and worthy to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to use the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the disk resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or else to whom . at different places there is an e @-@ mail menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , tool bar tool bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the script tree .
resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download it . to make a contribution we recommend to sign the resources for which it needs a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . this ensures the origin of resources , both for our team and for the future users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for their private G@@ PG key after their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can select one . in Di@@ alogue New Resource you need to fill in the input fields ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading .
the upload can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , upload tool bar tool@@ bars , and start in the context menu of files and folders in the template and script tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , we investigate and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signi@@ fication . in case of problems it warns and it can then be cancelled . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the resource of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; however , creation may be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files in XML format might be necessary . there &apos;s the easier way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D menu and converting a DT@@ D . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description to be used . after that the following dialog appears :
destination Name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type definition line : the string that appears in ! doc@@ type tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after conversion the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; there are some key concepts . in order to understand these and full benefits from and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze themselves with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to explain them exactly these concepts without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; little use .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project related . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
global elements are available for anyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . from tool@@ bars to actions , everything that is selected as global is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool bars , actions and patterns in the global tree that are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that only this user can personally use them .
project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply said , this is the most constra@@ ined size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ powers the common use of special tools and samples from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Editor window , the builder window , the boxes with information and the tool@@ bars .
you can click the tabs with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other or all tabs , rel@@ o@@ ading , del@@ eting or up@@ loading of the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CVS orders to the current document .
right click in the editor range leads to a further context menu with regard to the edited document contents , such as basic processing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , edit the tag under the mouse cursor , or open the file when the string is called a file under the mouse cursor .
at the top of the editor window , the tool bars of the editor are located . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional is a standard for which a set of tool bar is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and thus connected user needs .
the use of tool bar is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; insert it into your document , then click the icon that represents the tag . now you can insert the data for this just inserted day . if you want to insert a tag that has several attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the tree views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow you to navigate and browse the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . in the presentation with tabs stand for files , project , pattern templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mou@@ sec@@ lick . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting files from the storage media can be done with the displayed context menu .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website , etc ; There are all possibilities open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; work area . global templates are always available , local templates only for the corresponding user and templates in projects are only usable in the project .
here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of breakdown in global , location and project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button you can access the information available to a script .
with this view , one displays the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right clicking an element opens a list of commands related to navigation and refresh of the tree .
this tree appears among the other tree views . with it , it can quickly change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the application system that is aligned with the content allows to change all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be added , edited and considered .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two tabs at the bottom of the window , can be accessed via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the current document mark@@ up . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ scripts that are executed give all error messages ( so which ones ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool bar is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a toolbar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; send the tool bar as compressed T@@ ar Archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a toolbar in an email , they can secure and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this auto@@ conf has a number of options which can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are simple to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems when starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if you have problems with starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 is located in the PAT@@ H in front of their bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE desktop . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; optimized for rapid web development and combines a well @-@ engineered development environment with a variety of powerful features .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , exten@@ sible mark@@ up language editor would ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now widely on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then should &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; therefore the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
well , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; Co . developer community . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follow , in good use of free software , the idea of Why develop what anyone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; framework is not only this all possible , but allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of automatic actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task possible .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for fast web development and has been quickly expanded to a well @-@ engineered editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is not in any way connected with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
to find out more in the details , use help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and maintained by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequ@@ encing @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , and the oldest record is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . look in the section on templates . if they attempt to save the selected file / text outside the local / project file folder , only one error will be reported .
converts when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there special characters for &amp; html ; -@@ write , so that they are displayed correctly and are not mis@@ understood by the browser as a format@@ ting instruction .
converts the text from the clip@@ board to &amp; URL ; -@@ write which is the correct way to insert specific characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s in the anchor tag .
enables you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful when your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script releases error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you can see the display of script actions and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
the problem repor@@ ter on the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem repor@@ ter is activated as soon as you change to the structure tree .
shows the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a click of the mouse .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next , depending on the cursor position in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects will be saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
displays a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . that allows you to copy video files to your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de , and whether you have downloaded further input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects you will find the details explained .
loads a project toolbar . these are stored in project tools / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool bar . allows you to select the type of tool bar : locally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . that just creates the name . actions need to be added by settings actions ... added . tool bars are saved by toolbar tool@@ bars or you will be asked when you exit , if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
removes a toolbar from the field of view . this does not delete it from disk . if you haven &apos;t yet saved the tool bar , you will be asked if you want to do this .
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team so the toolbar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an attachment .
allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in .
loading a &amp; DT@@ D ; , which has made you or anyone else and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be fresh@@ ened up without renew@@ ing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and there is no write permission in the global K@@ DE folder , the load fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the default ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar .
allows access to the current tag settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always available in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menus .
activating or de@@ activates the smart insertion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent insertion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the insertion is refused by means of toolbar if this tag contradic@@ ts the rules .
in the plug@@ ins menu , the available plug@@ ins are listed under the menu items listed above . click on them . clicking on an activated plug will de@@ activate it .
sel@@ ects the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the type ; version .
very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; ti@@ dy by external application .
instant switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching sometimes may need time or cause un@@ nice graphics . the flash@@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub @-@ window . selecting an entry activates the corresponding sub@@ window .
enables the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window on or off .
the changes in this dialog will affect any application using the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
set the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; kate , you will find details .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbar or which you can add and change sequences .
this should generate a help according to the environment of the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter , but is not yet implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project , developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled up from top to bottom , as the entire directory structure for the rest of the project is automatically completed , e.g. after completing the project name . all of these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties Properties .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file is filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here is the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ fr ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if this field is empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates are saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and default templates . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows you to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . for server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
let it be checked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included . if a project is started from scratch , do not hook up .
with this option all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an exact selection according to your credit .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the files you want by tick or by removing the check@@ box from the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that make your work easier . in the Project Properties menu , these settings can be uploaded to the Project Properties menu in the menu tree in the menu tree or Shift + F@@ 7 keyboard short@@ cut .
some settings correspond to those in the Project Assistant and are described in detail . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholders possible ) , which are ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to top , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this can be used to select the desired de@@ bu@@ gger . currently , only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set with the Options button .
in the Profile Up@@ load section , upload profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as the display of a tree view for each profile by cont@@ acting your own tree view for each profile .
in the Team configuration window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration sub@@ window , event actions can be disabled and these actions can be added , changed or deleted . event actions are executed when a pre @-@ defined event occurs , such as backing up a file . see the details .
by default , open &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was open . you can &apos;t influence this behavior at the moment .
to open another project , select Open Project ... from the Project menu or the Project icon Open from the toolbar . the dialog Open Project will be displayed and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as enlargement .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folder behave as well , but the opening and opening entries are missing with the right mouse button on the right @-@ click context menu :
here different profiles can be selected . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows removal of the current profile . if there is only one profile , the button is blin@@ ded to prevent removing .
this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather uns@@ af@@ e password on the disk save option does not come into question .
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; many upload profiles can be created and the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . editing or creating a profile will display this dialog :
this is the name of the server on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should select from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port .
depending on your ang@@ st wave , this is either a time @-@ saving feature or a danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so that it cannot be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be a lot of views in a project , i.e. , by simply changing the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be opened , opened or deleted from the Project or Project Tool@@ bar menu , accessible from the tool toolbar project toolbar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; with which one has the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to their own way of working .
as mentioned above , tool bar lists are stack@@ able in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . the best thing about the tool bar menu can be set . the addition of tool bar is treated below in the Ad@@ ding tool bar section .
the tool bar and the symbols on it can be set either by context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar ) , in which New Action , a New toolbar can be created , other actions such as tool bar can be removed , tool bar ren@@ ame or tool@@ bars can be executed , indicating which actions should be visible on this or other tool bar .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a toolbar , the entries will be removed and action edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the Settings menu ... and set settings actions .. set .
templates are essentially document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used templates basically like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the limitations one imag@@ ines for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template prior to use .
binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. pictures with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . more information on the template tree is available in .
documents can be of any type of text . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally , more specialized documents can be found in appropriate sub@@ folders . a few examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see in for more information on the template tree .
this type of template is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should always be inserted in the documents . you can include everything from a comment to a final grade to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole web sites . they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
create a document structure as you like ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As Tem@@ plate Save As Local Tem@@ plate ....
once this is done , note that ( even if it has been saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File As Tem@@ plate Save Sel@@ ection as Local / Project Tem@@ plate . alternatively , the selection can be easily dra@@ gged and dra@@ gged to the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used for it , such as pulling and dropping or past@@ ing over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can click on a folder on the right in the file tree or in the Project Files to create a name for the template and back up . by default , it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates enable a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can give he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynamically with &amp; PHP ; design , add files or link them with them . additionally , you can keep some things in mind when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders is one of four types of containers , as explained above .
to specify the behavior of a folder , right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is da@@ zz@@ led when par@@ ental attributes have been verb@@ alized .
this is enabled by default and fits all except the regular folders in the template overview . if a root folder is set so it would generally disable templates in this path unless they are explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear with something like a text module . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder .
allows for a pre@@ defined or re @-@ represented text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows for copying of content templates to a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
you can also use the context menu ( to show right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provides two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor that can be accessed from the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second sub@@ divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cursor . then you can edit and turn back to source code editor , where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor at a document containing &amp; PHP ; a small green symbol shows the default of &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit &amp; PHP ; there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first one except that the changes are visible both in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor and the cursor in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor is running in sync . pressing F@@ 9 activates the active cursor from one window to the other , maintaining the position in the document .
the synchronization ratio between the V@@ PL ; editor and source text editor can be set via settings Qu@@ anta .... After selecting V@@ PL ; -@@ View , you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation can be set automatically : a small span for fast hosts and a large span for slow .
assuming you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to choose tools document properties . this allows editing invisible tags when working with the V@@ PL ; Editor . the document properties dialog will also be called as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor . this can change the following :
met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list allows to change the contents , e.g. keywords on the column name and Key@@ word Key@@ word 2 on the contents column .
CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is exactly as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported yet .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by clicking the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file .
the cursor is as in a word processing , by moving with arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cursor acts as usual . text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted by typing and dropped by button or distance button .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way via the tool bar , as in the source text editor . it is important to note that inser@@ ting tags previously does not remove existing identical tags , e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded with text , each other surrounding ar@@ mature tag must be removed .
some tool bars such as the T@@ ables Assistant or Listen Assistant are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists must be used tool bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for examining style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style sheet style can be tra@@ cked .
to comp@@ ress &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; compile it successfully , use the lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml libraries , which are already present in a typical installation by &amp; k@@ de .
support in a template , at one point in a style or x@@ ml file loaded by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g or at the current node . new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , orph@@ aned points can be set in a specific file and line number and later activated .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g returns the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without path@@ name . file names in the same folder as the top loaded period file name with relative path to the con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g work folder . for example , a style file file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l is loaded , the following entry is possible :
in this command , a partial or total agreement with a pre@@ age called QNAP or a specified model name will be verified . &amp; eg ; template will match with each QNA@@ P@@ cloud that includes the template template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the given &quot; QNA@@ P@@ cloud &quot; is extended to the rules specified by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 will &amp; eg ; extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a required stopping point has to be resolved for the corresponding UR@@ I and line number . this is automatically executed when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . holding points will be re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each iter@@ ation .

&quot; &quot; &quot; start a shell . then enter the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; help &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; help &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; command to get an overview of the help . &quot; &quot; &quot;
adds the parameter with the name &amp; lt ; NA@@ ME ; and the value &amp; lt ; V@@ AL@@ U@@ E@@ Y ; added to the X@@ SL environment variables . see also the documentation for the command &quot; add@@ par@@ am &quot;
if --@@ repeat is 2 times indicated , the conversion will be executed 100 times
the input documents are treated as HTML files if the support for this has been activated in lib@@ x@@ ml
activates the X@@ Inclu@@ de processing of the input document when the support for this has been activated in lib@@ x@@ ml ; this is turned on as default
on systems with the installed Re@@ ad@@ line library , you can scroll up / down with the arrow keys on / off from the command memory of the previously executed commands .
multiple commands require more than one argument . quotation marks can be used to give composite expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; as an argument , a holding point is set in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; . &quot;
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name for a template consisting only of the ASCII characters 0x@@ 00 to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a fully qualified name like &quot; x@@ s@@ l : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;
fil@@ en@@ ame : a valid local file name on the user &apos;s system . on Unix or Cy@@ g@@ win systems , the name may have the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as a short form for the personal folder . other environment variables are also allowed on R@@ IS@@ C @-@ OS systems .
path : a path to change the working folder . on some operating systems , the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; is replaced by the path to your personal folder .
data : the XML @-@ data or the XML _ document , which is processed by the style sheet . see also &amp; lt ; FI@@ LE@@ NA@@ ME ; and lt ; UR@@ I@@ gt ;
running time commands : { bye _ BA@@ R _ exit _ BA@@ R _ quit } , step , step up , step down , next , continue , run , trace , set@@ option , options
there are many graphical tools to compare . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file .
the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see exactly what changed within those lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a little night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could show differences within one line and changes to white signs . later , any number of other useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and paste it into one of the comparison windows .
a function that made a lot of work was the same and merging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a fully @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
this is useful when two persons work independently on one piece of code and make changes . the merge editor among the differences windows allows to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when merging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when merging the folder :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of current color monitors . if you frequently have to check code , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tabs are displayed visible . if rows only differ in a certain number of white characters , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble if someone changes ind@@ entation . )
if a file is equal and the other one is different in one line , then the color indicates which file is different .
if all files have the same name , but are in different folders , then you can ease the typing work by just writing the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 -@@ o target folder k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 folder 2 folder 3 -@@ o target folder
the Open dialog allows manual typing of fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the opening dialog tells your selection and displays it again next time . you don &apos;t need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences will be done with two files .
by selecting a folder , you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the merge or merge of folders will be initiated . if for A a file is selected , for B and C , however , a folder , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders .
if merging is enabled , the input field becomes active for the target and can be edited . however , it is not absolutely necessary to immediately set an output file . you can also do this step later when saving .
the Settings button opens a dialog with Settings . here , you can set options before starting to merge / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts then immediately . in opening dialog , you do not need to select files , you can close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button .
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
what is the idea behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you only need to create two corresponding files , upload them to &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : at the moment , you can &apos;t exclude anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only dropping text into a comparison window will be supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program than cut and paste ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) E@@ ach info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse over the line for a while .
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these default settings can be changed using the Settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , you can see the color , which file differs . if both files differentiate , the default color is red for it . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . this is in the next section ( merge ) well to see .
when differences are found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , for example , white signs are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few rare cases . )
the vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no rows . if the line break is enabled , the line is represented on broken lines .
the result window ( among the reference windows ) also has an info row with the text output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changes &#93; if you have edited the result . usually , it contains text by automatic merging , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is down@@ lighted ! ! ! ( use the S@@ prin@@ ge buttons to the next resolved / un@@ solved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , each difference is also a conflict that needs to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group belonging to the line will be selected in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed .
sometimes there is no other line left in the group by automatic merging or manual editing ; this is only a plac@@ eholder in the event that you change your mind and maybe choose another source . this text does not appear in the final stored file , nor in a marking that you may copy and insert somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflicts ; however , appears in the clip@@ board when you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : when selecting the sources ignor@@ ing the options or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs .
navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , up , down , side up , start , end , C@@ trl @-@ start and C@@ trl @-@ end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs .
in the output window , you can also use the other buttons for editing . with the In@@ sert key , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns will synchron@@ ize the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merge section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can skip to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous difference ( C@@ trl @-@ picture to Move / C@@ trl @-@ Image A@@ way ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict .
to copy the mark to the clip@@ board , you have to press the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ In@@ sert ) . if enabled , you automatically copy whatever you mark , automatically copy it to the clip@@ board and skip the manual copying . however , be careful with this option because you may over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board accidentally .
line ends are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use carriage return + new@@ line \ \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 does not keep the line end of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of last used files will be automatically saved when you exit and will be restored at the next start . ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 set up ... )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose , but you should not use them . )
activating this option displays differences in itali@@ c script . if the selected font does not support this representation , nothing happens at all .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered ast@@ ert .
if this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the Tab key . otherwise , a tab@@ ul@@ ator character is inserted .
when pressing Enter or Return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line will be used automatically for the next line .
when this option is enabled , each selection is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . the manual copying to the clip@@ board is no longer necessary .
you can select which line type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used choice on the operating system used .
when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 first to find all the fully identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step , white signs are ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a carriage return character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , while others only store a new@@ line \ &apos; . usually ignore &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the car return label , but then files with different sizes in page @-@ by @-@ page comparison will look identical , although they are different . while merging , this option must be disabled .
in the default setting , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated signs ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . as a result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated as white signs .
this option is disabled in default . changes in comments will be treated as changes in white characters .
search for even smaller differences . the option is activated by default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slow with very large files .
in the automatic jump mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict continues .
this is useful when white characters are less important in many files . if you need this only from time to time , then use the Select A / B / C functions for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that automatic selection also applies to conflicts in numbers or comments when options ignore numbers or ignore C / C + + comments .
these options are handled in the chapter for scanning folders and exec@@ uting a merge . for details , see documentation for directory comparison and merge .
if a file is saved and already an older version exists , the original version will be app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
changes the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you must &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart to make the change active . ( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally via the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be set for each entry separately . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
over the drop @-@ down boxes for encoding appears a short notice what the local encoding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal character . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different encoding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding is to be used for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they might not work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of pre@@ processing commands .
turn this off to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting of changes in white characters in text or overview columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments when options ignore numbers or ignore C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are shown in a color @-@ coded overview column . but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files .
sometimes you &apos;d like to use the space available on the screen for long lines . just skip the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you look at the differences and then decide to merge the files together . a simple click starts the merge and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart merge , then the name of the last used output file will be maintained . )
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that exactly meets your requirements . you can use this function for example to cut out disrup@@ tive parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this pre@@ processing command .
the idea behind this is to provide the user with more flexibility when setting up the diff @-@ results . however , an external program is required , and most users don &apos;t want to program it by themselves .
use this pre @-@ processing command for new@@ lines to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is an erg@@ o expression that matches any string and in this context all characters are listed in one line . \ \ 1 in the creation string is related to the found text in upper@@ case .
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated character strings ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ keyword @-@ generated text $ . now , a pre @-@ processing command for line reconciliation is required : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you may start to understand it and maybe you may even like these regular expressions . you are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre @-@ processing command for line ab@@ err@@ s. sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , so quasi er@@ ased .
sometimes you might want to perform several re@@ plac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the re@@ plac@@ ements from each other . example :
instead , you can also use something else such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / Re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / Re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / Re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / Re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / Re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / Re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / Del@@ ete / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the preceding &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor are retained for display and merging . further operations only change the data that the new@@ line al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus looks like .
note : in rare cases when using a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often , program@@ mers in a folder need to edit a lot of files . for this reason , you can compare and merge entire folders recur@@ sively .
... makes a suggestion for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before starting ,
... can simulate merging and displays the simulated changes without actually performing them ,
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and merging individual files . you just need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog box .
when three folders are merged , folder 1 will be used as a base . if no target folder was specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically , not merging . to start merging , you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . )
while reading the folder , you will find a small message window about current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folders , only the files that were compared to that time are listed .
when scanning the folder is finished , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded up . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - , or double clicking on the object or by using the arrow keys for left / right .
if you double @-@ click on a file , the comparison window will start and a comparison window appears .
the symbol in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the Details window to the selected object . in such a case the merge action cannot be automatically selected . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about any problems of this type .
as shown in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns .
in identical entries , however , the color is identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered identical when their entire content is identical . then , folders also have the same color . with folders , the age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ ty@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , becomes red .
... A and C are identical but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A is a folder and B ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , the merging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A is a folder and B ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , the merging cannot be started .
the synchronization mode is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified , and if the option is synchron@@ ized to directories . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action out so that both folders are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ame for the output file only B ; copied directly after the merge &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders are merged , and the option New file instead of merging ( uns@@ af@@ e ) is enabled , then expl@@ ores &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is identical . if such errors are not removed , the merge of the folder cannot be started .
while merging , one file is processed after the other . it displays the status column when the merge succ@@ eeds , and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurs . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right .
when in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display additional columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , deleted , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( File or O@@ dner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start merging .
please note : if you have not specified a destination folder , then C will be used as the target in the Three @-@ Fol@@ der @-@ merge mode , B is chosen as the target , and A and / or B are used as the target when synchron@@ izing .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check that all entries that should be in the destination folder will also be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that may be ski@@ pped in the folder structure . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select the directory merge and continue in the list menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) . to only merge the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if invalid combination actions still exist by conflic@@ ting file types , a message appears that indicates er@@ ron@@ eous elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog box appears with the options through , Sim@@ ulate and Canc@@ el .
select Sim@@ u@@ ate if you would like to see what would happen without actually making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; execute specific actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merging a single file ) , a merge window opens ( note the screen@@ shot ) .
when you are finished with a file , select another directory merge , continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t yet saved it , a corresponding dialog appears . then you will execute &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work continues with the next entry .
if you encounter a bug , a message and detailed status information will appear . at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you eliminate the cause of the problem . if you continue merging ( F@@ 7 key ) , you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in a different way before you continue merging .
if some entries have been merged together , you notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and will not merge them again at the later compilation of all entries . even if the merge has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered finished . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Menu Settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called Fol@@ der merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . multiple patterns can be entered . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ cards : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( eg * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders do not have to match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS . many self @-@ format@@ ted files are ignored by CVS . the great advantage is that this file can be set with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a hidden attribute . in other file systems , a preceding dot indicates a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled by default .
for links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled by default .
when the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the links will be treated like normal folders and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; does not check for possible recur@@ sions . a link to a folder that contains a link on itself would lead to an infinite loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is disabled by default .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns . ( the number of resolved , un@@ solved , non@@ - white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ sample . )
if you compare large folders through a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the modified date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is disabled in default .
similar to the date of change . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical when they are equal . this can be useful , for example , when the change date has been lost . please use caution . this option is disabled in default .
enable synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for merging are selected so that both folders are identical . also the results of merging files are saved in both folders . this option is disabled by default .
if there are differences , instead of merging the copy of the newer file will be suggested as an action . ( this is considered uns@@ af@@ e because the knowledge is provided that the other file has not been modified . ) This option is disabled in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version will be renamed and will get the .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merging of single files , not just the merging of entire folders . this option is enabled by default .
you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can split the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can split the menu option &amp; Text window to main window in the window menu and switch between the two views using a change between the directory &amp; text window .
you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge . to do this , use the current file merging from the merge menu . to do this , use the current file merging from the merge menu . to do this , use the current file merging from the merge menu .
however , this status is lost when you re @-@ read the directory : directory -@@ Menu : read new
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open , located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . you should consider a few things :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. contain . that is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , Space &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then a file is always accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or modification dates . therefore , the per@@ missions or modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al of Size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently the difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP first always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part display from the context menu .
normally needed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is applied as a part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; assuming that the input file is a patch file in unified format . then removes the name of the original file from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program to restore the missing file .
in the kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select Pre@@ Pre@@ view into - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exist . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the creation of the patch file .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as a part , it supports only comparing two files , a very small toolbar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now it &apos;s compact ) already exist . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the diff tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a very long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all program@@ mers who went this way or would like to go this way .
you compiled the program from the sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in the default configure configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical first ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not identical .
the editor notices for every difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this is necessary to easily resolve a conflict by clicking in the source code and selecting the A / B / C button . however , this important information is lost when the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could store this information .
the effort required was so far too large . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to process larger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly bored ; No sr@@ c is left ; and the text can &apos;t be deleted . what does that mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and mis@@ ses the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information about how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source package .
to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ s@@ 3 ; -@@ distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir will specify the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .

cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift @-@ Del@@ ete ) copies to clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . paste ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift @-@ Pa@@ ste ) inserts the text from the clip@@ board at the current cursor position or replaces the current selection .
show only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , after changes to these options , you must re @-@ read the folder with the Update function . )
there are only entries that show differences . this also causes identical files to not be copied to the destination folder when merging . if the target folder doesn &apos;t already contain these files , they will be missing after merging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default .
if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be app@@ ended to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed when clicking on the button .
in default , this option is disabled . differences in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displays a thumb@@ nail of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite handy to see the running programs on working surfaces , change their size , end them or post@@ p@@ one them . this works both inside a desktop as well as several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and on the other .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible in both a desktop and on other working surfaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu has only the two entries to set up p@@ ager ... and exit . if however on an application inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the icon and name of the application as well as the Minim@@ ize , Maxim@@ ize , On Desktop and Finish . the commands create the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work@@ spaces .
if this field is enabled , the name of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops will be displayed in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
tick this field allows the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager to display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is enabled together with name , the names are provided with folder numbers , &amp; eg ; 1 . desktop .
if this field is enabled , the background of each desktop will also be displayed as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displayed .
if this field is enabled , the current programs will be displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only empty spaces are displayed to allow them to be selected .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the windows with their standard icon and pix@@ map displays a small view of the actual program window . note : pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; -@@ main window can be determined : classi@@ cally &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N ra@@ ster appear , as from p@@ ager applications in some other Windows managers ; horizontal , all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops appear horizontal and vertical in a vertical range , which is very good for displaying side@@ ways on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display and move the windows as symbols or with their contents . in addition , it runs outside the control bar .
right @-@ click inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then select switch set up ... allows the dialog to appear .
currently this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vice versa . if you do not have any write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or turn to your system administrator .

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a screen lou@@ pe . you can use &amp; edit a part of the screen as if you read a magni@@ fying glass for the print or the exact viewing of a photograph . this application is interesting for different users : this includes artists , web designers and people with visual impairment .
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly updated to include new features . it is optimized for use on high performance computers .
when you start &amp; edit , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window is called a magni@@ fication window . the image that is displayed in the magni@@ fication window is an enlarged area of the screen and is described as a selection window in the following .
in the default setting , you can &amp; k the area around the mouse cursor as a moving magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can &amp; k ; this causes a selected screen area to be displayed in the magni@@ fication window ( selection window mode ) or the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the cursor position . please note that &amp; k@@ mag ; currently it is not able to see the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default node ; / Q@@ t ; mouse cursor .
in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse cursor in the magni@@ fication window and keep the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fication window . this also works with the arrow keys .
if you additionally press the &amp; Shift key , press or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the selection window .
with this combination you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the drop @-@ down window remains fixed and only the lower right corner is to move .
&amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save it into a file , copy it to the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more .
start or stop the display . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , High@@ ly high ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to save files , open a new window , print , rel@@ o@@ ad ( with the button Document again loaded in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , magni@@ fication and reduction &amp; etc ; .
it may also be known as a magni@@ fier ; it is a screen magni@@ fier ; you can use &amp; zoom , use a magni@@ fier to view the print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artists to web designer or visually impaired .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click once the mouse @-@ cursor continues for a while at the same position . it is thought to help people who suffer from the repeti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and each mouse click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without any pain . unfortunately , pain caused by the use of your computer may also cause pain . if you suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this has not yet happened .
to clear it once more : even though &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click once you pause the motion briefly .
move the mouse , wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button . in this way you can drag the mouse with pressed mouse button . this allows you to drag the mouse with pressed mouse button . the intelligent shifting requires a little exercise , but you get used to it quickly .
this residence time must be stored after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , a click of the mouse .
if Smart Ver@@ ses is enabled , the time of rotation ( 1 / 10 s ) is activated . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button , wait before releasing the mouse button again if there is no moving of the mouse in the meantime .
this moves will be saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .@@ txt in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time it is started , but can be changed later .
when the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the response time . go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the Ri@@ der General . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer that will set you to a lower value to shor@@ ten response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; available . for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically there .
set all settings to the values set when you open the dialog . if you already press the Apply button , the settings will be reset to the stand after the last press .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first , use the default settings . in particular , the smart move should be switched off first . if you then get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later move the smart move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it might need the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; to decrease with sounds .
first , you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that does not show a link does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use it again .
when your mouse clicks you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the trick is that you don &apos;t just clean the mouse , but also the rollers that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you need to take the mouse out of it . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear when you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you &apos;d have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . you can scra@@ pe the dirt and dirt easily with a flat blade or finger nail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of the k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are using the smart move in this case , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer stop by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , using another window manager and post@@ p@@ one a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can carry out a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and place the cursor in another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor where you want to have it . but leave the mouse on a neutral zone of the desktop , if you want to make a keyboard input . thus , accidental moving of the mouse cursor can cause un@@ inten@@ tional reactions . secure zones for the mouse cursor are &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the head@@ lines of windows .
I try to work with intelligent shifting , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text .
the intelligent move is an advanced feature of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very probably possible to copy text , copy it to the clip@@ board , or to execute any other action you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice :
do not use the smart move if you just start using it &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select text like this : at one end of the text area , select a mouse click and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this means that every time the mouse button is played , the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the move time starts when intelligent . later you can also use the intelligent shift without the audi@@ ble click of the mouse . however , it requires some practice .
to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ test extension for &amp; X windows needs to be installed . this should be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and is correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter stops . this program is designed for people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome and who are causing pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured in such a way that it wa@@ its for a certain time to start a Drag process before releasing the mouse button . in this way , the drag and drop can be done with the mouse .

&amp; mouth ; is a program that allows silent users to let their computer speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation history sets that are to be re @-@ spoken .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen@@ shot ) you enter the command which will later be used for the speech output of text . for more details , please refer to the description of the setup dialog .
from the text passages , you can select text passages often used without having to type them in . of course , the text passages can be edited .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) you define the dictionary for word completion . &amp; mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . additionally , you can balance the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be included in word completion .
the main window of &amp; mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a delay memory of the already spoken phrases ( the upper white field in the screen shot ) .
mouth ; upright , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence will be app@@ ended to the memory storage . you can select sets that should be spoken once again .
with the settings box mouth ; mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog from &amp; mouth ; this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the Wor@@ ter@@ itory Page and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the flash@@ card language edition , enter the command to call the language generator . in the drop @-@ down box below the input field , set the character encoding , with the text passed to the voice generator .
&amp; mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on as standard input to the voice generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command for voice output depends on your voice generator . you will find this command in the documentation for your speech generator . examples for this are given in the app@@ endi@@ x .
if this is successful , the further settings on this page will be ignored . if this is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . kt@@ ale d language service is a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . selecting this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection box action after selecting a text passage you decide which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the Text passage book or in the box for text passages .
with the selection of Instant Mess@@ ages , the chosen text passage is directly spoken and additionally inserted into the disk space . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is entered first only in the input field .
the second drop of the edit window for text passages allows you to specify whether the text passages book should be automatically saved when closing the editing window .
selecting text passages book will save the book . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text@@ book book will not be saved . select Before saving , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text match book should be saved .
the Wor@@ ter@@ itory Page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for word completion . in the main window , next to the input field , &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box if this list contains more than one dictionary .
with the buttons on the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the name and the language for the dictionary in the input field .
for this source select the desired language ; &amp; mouth ; then reads the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of the individual words is simply determined by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option , you create a new , empty dictionary with no entries . since &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically add into the dictionary , you can create a dictionary with your vocabulary in the course of time .
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are displayed as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passages book , you can only change its name .
you can add actions such as new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either via the selection in the menu bar , in the toolbar , or through a drop @-@ down menu .
you can change the order of text passages or text passages by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new position or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the default memory .
the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the default memory .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the default memory .
if this menu entry is selected , a sliding tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . the toolbar is by default placed above the editing window directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the toolbar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is selected , a narrow bar at the bottom of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; mouth ; displayed if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is selected , a sliding bar for text passages with entries is displayed . by mouse click on the hat@@ ched left side and drag the toolbar can be moved to another location .
you probably did not enter the command for the voice output correctly or not completely . open settings k@@ mouth ; set ... , open the page General Settings and enter the command for voice output on the voice output voice output . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thesizer to see more details . )
the festival is a voice @-@ over@@ s system from the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival will be installed in the / usr / local / festival folder .
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator written in &amp; Java . currently , it supports only the English pron@@ unci@@ ation .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ tray folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following commands :
for the third example , the option must be enabled to send data as default input . ( this is the recommended example for the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a voice generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately Ha@@ di@@ fax would like to swal@@ low the last character of the text , so that an additional character must be app@@ ended . the full command is therefore more elaborate than in the other examples :
/ usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as default input must be enabled .
the voice output dem@@ on from &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
since the voice generator is set only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ ales as a voice service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the settings dialog of &amp; mouth ; when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; mouth ; to successfully use , you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; mouth ; is an application that allows people who cannot talk to print text through the computer . it stores a list of already spoken phrases that the user can always re @-@ spend .
note that &amp; mouth ; does not include any language syn@@ thesizer . a voice syn@@ thesizer needs to be installed on the computer .
for more detailed user documentation , use help : / mouth ( enter either this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or launch k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; - the voice output system from &amp; k@@ de ; - is an existing service that allows every application to read text via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program@@ mers ready to use their applications with T@@ TS capacities .
pre @-@ reading texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; kate , even if it is embedded in other &amp; cate ; applications .
the speech output is used via the speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher program , which uses various background programs such as es@@ peak , festival , and so on .
allows you to generate language editions on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; utility program .
in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for speech mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Met@@ a @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the voice output service from &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible windows that provides T@@ TS services via &amp; d@@ bus ;

a module for web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
a text editor module ; a text file can be read in whole or in part .
in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database by &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ g@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) , there are discussions about &amp; kt@@ ops ; in the k@@ de @-@ automatic mailing list . subscribe to the list via ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ deutsch .
before you can use it , you need to install and configure the speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher application .
during the first start of kt@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card card speaker is displayed . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the card card is displayed in general .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up multiple variations for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up a speaker before you &amp; kt@@ ops ; use as the program speed @-@ dispat@@ cher otherwise uses the standard speaker .
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer can be compared to several printer sp@@ ans for the same printer .
when you click on the tab leader in kt@@ m@@ gr , the card card speaker is displayed . it will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up .
all speakers already set up appear in this list . the preferred speakers will appear in the list above . the top speaker is used for voice output if there is no speaker .
with a mouse click select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
with a mouse click select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to move the speaker in the list one line further down . the order of speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
select a voice type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girl &apos;s voice to choose from .
when you click here , the new speaker appears on the tab Spe@@ aker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can &amp; kt@@ ops ; almost use it . go back to the General tab and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled so that the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; starts . see . now you can &amp; kt@@ ops ; use to read text orders .
if you have set up at least one speaker , you can start the learning system from &amp; k@@ de . click the map tab General to open this flash@@ card . here you can set some general options .
select this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ops ; system . this will start the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card card orders will be displayed and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the marker , becomes K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
when kt@@ m@@ gr is finished , it will run &amp; kt@@ ops ; further , if the field voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ m@@ gr appears automatically when reading in the Control Panel &apos;s system area , it disappears again as soon as the read is finished .
the buttons in this series allow you to start , pause , pause , and resume text orders .
the buttons in this series allow you to read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board , or open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for one job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; click Apply or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; then all changed settings will be applied to all pages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the card card orders will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab and tick the voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . first , check if &amp; kt@@ ops ; runs . then check the text that should be read and select Text text in the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should begin .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ he@@ aders and other invisible brands are also pre @-@ read .
in &amp; Po@@ sters ; the advanced text editor from &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the displayed text first . first , check if &amp; kt@@ ops ; runs . then select the text to be read and select the Text text in the main menu . then the voice output should begin .
this also works when it is embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
k@@ Noti@@ fy is the &amp; k@@ de news system that informs you about the events you set out . you can also read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ons ; read .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program from &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different types of messages . for example , you can set up that you will be notified when a message appears in an IR@@ C channel where your nick@@ name occurs . you can then read the IR@@ C message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program K@@ not@@ fy , a menu entry appears in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for S@@ Noti@@ fy vary depending on the application .
the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is included in the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts , is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the term / local / in@@ box , since it can be assumed in most cases as assumed .
filters are one of the advanced skills of &amp; kt@@ ops ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ops ; filters are not required .
in filters , text is processed before being sent to the speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unci@@ ation to replace false spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker , or to circum@@ vent certain defici@@ encies of speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand the way filters work , it is important to know how the &quot; speech @-@ pat@@ cher &quot; program works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distinguishes four types of texts .
the display of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and keeps those orders . if the output of the screen readers is pre @-@ read , the retained jobs will be resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is subject to hot . a warning has preced@@ ence and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after issuing the warning .
News has the next highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; read a long text on a website , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ noti@@ fications are also news .
the rest are simple text orders . each order you initiate from the card order is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of an application that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that do not have any particular ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , except the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , during &amp; t@@ ts ; just one read , this issue will stop and termin@@ ate .
first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages .
filter edit the text and pass it to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future , there can be even further types of filters .
text boxes replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced are delivered either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ops ; is delivered with pre @-@ defined string set filters that allow the creation of chat @-@ emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for re@@ format@@ ting messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a more understandable form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Trans@@ forms use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . includes some X@@ SL@@ T files for the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
with speaker selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ons ; sent to a speaker . for example , if you have set a female voice on the card tab Spe@@ aker , you can read text from K@@ DE news about it . read it .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules after which it is applied for voice output . if the filter detects that its rules do not apply , it continues to pass the text to the next filter .
when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ notification to &amp; kt@@ ops ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the page below . processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of normal filters that are set up . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filter will be executed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and the following setup di@@ alogs are shown below .
for setting label asser@@ tion filters you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be replaced with the corresponding replacement text . case @-@ sensitive case is not observed when comparing .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it only needs to be distinguished from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the match column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Er@@ bet . the list is executed in the displayed order from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
these buttons allow you to load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries from the file are attached to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter is only applied if the speaker speaks one of the languages listed here for the text job . click the button to view a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ trl key at the click of the mouse .
if a value is entered here , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID running programs will get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers you need to om@@ it . if , for example , q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you may only enter copies .
the string replacing filter is only applied to the text when all conditions with an entry in the box Apply filter when matching . if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the character chain replace filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . thus , the words must be limited by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . but if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; terms can be found in the ambig@@ u@@ ls package .
XML ; Trans@@ forms translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from one format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such trans@@ formations . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
specify the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the PAT@@ H environment variable , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c also suff@@ ices .
the speaker selection filter allows you to send texts to a particular speaker , who is set up on the tab card speaker , or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that text by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text is passed to the filter , it searches for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker properties that the program pres@@ ets , sending the text on &amp; kt@@ ops ; the speaker is selected using the speaker selection filter .
if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; press the button to get help when entering .
to achieve faster processing , try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , that is , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the properties of the speaker you want . if the text fulfil@@ s the filter conditions shown above , the speaker will be selected to match the desired requirements . click the button on the right to show the dialog box selection dialog .
use these buttons to save or load your subscri@@ ber settings or delete all settings .
the filter selection filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply to an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if apply . you must register at least one condition .
the voice @-@ over@@ s API , von &amp; k@@ de ; , with which program@@ mers can give their applications T@@ TS capacities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so &amp; kt@@ ops ; this syn@@ thesizer can be used .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of the speech output API from &amp; k@@ de ; . complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice sharing services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ Interface from &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ops over the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
text of the text for the reading and option is a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands , type :
open two &amp; console ; -@@ windows . only start kt@@ ops in one window , then kt@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers support my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ conversion filter , but web pages are not read when using the module for the festival .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able works at all . you must do that yourself if you do not use this voice for reading websites . also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found through the environment variable PAT@@ H .
certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation characters seem to cause errors in the syn@@ thesizer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only ch@@ ewing cat@@ fish is output . what can I do about it ?
first , make sure that the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be remedi@@ ed by a string release filter . see .

K@@ T@@ TS works with any language syn@@ thesizer that can be started on the command line in a console .
the list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , consult the description of the syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ops ; , for information , which are not yet included in this manual .
the &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; program uses adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you would like to extend it to use another syn@@ thesizer , please contact the developer team .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter but is not absolutely necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to compile , compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) , including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and development files for the program &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ops , from the source code archive for k@@ de@@ bar or downloaded the tar@@ ball created every night , you can compile and install the program using the following commands :
before using &amp; kt@@ ops , make sure you use the speech syn@@ thesizer in your speech syn@@ thesizer at first . to do this , you can use the sp@@ d @-@ conf shell script .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops ; the t@@ t@@ ms@@ gr utility is to be developed in such a way that the creation of speech tools is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer required .
a long text is broken into individual sets . the user can reverse the set or paragraph style , repeat , pause , or cancel the output .
for example , if you specify a speaker whose language is female and whose sex is female , it will be used , otherwise the best appropriate speaker will be used . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ops , select a speaker , look in .
if you click Add tab on the tab card and add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the card card speaker setup will display . as an example , the setup of the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below . for details on the modules , please refer to .
enter the path to the festival program exec@@ utable . if the path to the festival is included in the PAT@@ H festival , just enter the festival .
select the text encoding for text handed to the festival . if voices , the kt@@ ops , are known , this setting is done automatically . in general , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as c@@ zech or Slov@@ ak@@ ian use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ der controls , you adjust the volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select a number of kno@@ bs and display this grey , the voice you have selected doesn &apos;t let you select these settings .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need several seconds to load multiple seconds due to their size . if you select this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that ( with greater memory consumption ) the first set is syn@@ thes@@ ized more quickly .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or click on Apply ) .
if this check box is selected , the program window is displayed at the start of kt@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the kt@@ m@@ gr is visible in the system section after the start , but not the program window . click the icon in the system section to view the program window .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ m@@ gr runs not yet , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to pause or otherwise control the reading .
here are all the jobs listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sets and the currently edited set .
with the buttons in this series you can go ahead or go back in the order selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sentences ) .
by clicking on OK , all changes of the settings ( also on the other cards ) will be changed and kt@@ m@@ gr is reduced to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to view the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also .
here , only text orders are performed and managed . screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . read more about the message types of &amp; kt@@ ops ; find in .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ops , either without support for the corresponding audio module , it is not possible to load the required libraries .
if no output modules are to be used in the audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you will need to install at least one module . if you selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the speech speed here . 50@@ 1 ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ 000 ; for example the double normal speaking speed . to allow these settings to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; click Apply to take over the new settings for the current &amp; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kt@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out which device works with you . in case of doubt , choose Standard .
on this map , you can set up specific actions that will always be executed when the text assignment is interrupted by a higher priority message . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of voice orders :
the display of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . after the output of the screen readers is read , the retained jobs are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next highest priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is subject to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text .
News have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you are &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a website , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who is just entering the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , &amp; kt@@ ops , the audio output will enter the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both the introduc@@ tory sound and the introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played in front of the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card card are valid only for normal text orders . there are no special actions for messages , warnings and expenses for screen readers , if they are interrupted by a higher priority message .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ops ; read K@@ not@@ fy messages , start kt@@ m@@ gr and click al@@ erts . the flash@@ card noti@@ fications appear .
select this check box to disable the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; if this setting is not selected , the other settings are gra@@ yed out and kt@@ m@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts .
if this setting is selected , al@@ erts where a sound is played by &amp; kt@@ ops will not be read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears in which you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message before , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message .
all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ops ; ignored .
use this drop @-@ down box to specify what &amp; kt@@ ops ; do when an event arrives . you have the following choices :
if you have selected user defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter here the properties of the desired speaker . standard select the speaker that appears in the list on the tab card speaker as the top entry .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a specific application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application .
the event All noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list ) . for this , you can set the pre @-@ pending noti@@ fications as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications to a file . use the Load button to load stored settings from a file . loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except All noti@@ fications will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to highlight text for voice output . this standard contains stamps for controlling voices , speech speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . also marks for controlling the pron@@ unci@@ ation for example abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is a part of Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ops ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in the basic functions . the following restrictions are present :
you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) , since this is the standard voice that uses the festival in the output of SS@@ ML .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter ( SD@@ B filter ) . S@@ B@@ Ds sub@@ divide text into individual sets . this allows you to start faster with the read when only the first set needs to be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the entire text order .
here you see the set of pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ops , a set of pro@@ posi@@ tional filters is set up automatically . you can change its settings or add further set @-@ limits filters , but beginners will get rid of them .
the easiest way to learn how to set up the speaker selection by selecting it . select orders , which speaker &amp; t@@ ts ; select orders from the box menu , change some properties and check how the selection of the speaker is changed . of course , you need to have more than one speaker installed , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; then start faster with the read , because only the first sentence has to be processed and not the whole block of text , which can take a long time ,
you can pause or cancel text orders on the card card , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer doesn &apos;t support this function .
for these reasons , the regular pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter is set up automatically when you start kt@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing .
con@@ formance Reco@@ gni@@ tion filters compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ posi@@ tional texts and add a tab@@ ul@@ ator character ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) at the set limits ( tab@@ ul@@ ator characters are automatically removed from the text in front of the filter ) .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages ( k@@ notify ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers .
if you have removed the normal Record identi@@ fier filter from mistake , you can insert it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in the kt@@ ops ;
you can over@@ ride the subscri@@ ber settings for the application on the box menu . the card is displayed when
use of the default speaker ( the top speaker on the tab Spe@@ aker ) . in other words , no speaker properties are specified .
use of the most appropriate speaker that has all the features of a set @-@ up speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker settings , select &amp; kt@@ ops ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ops ; select the speaker closest to the originally set characteristics .
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the properties of the desired speaker here . if this property does not play a role , do not enter anything .
select this check box if the property should have preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set multiple marks here .
since the language is a critical factor in the understanding of the output , it is always treated as the primary property . you will rarely use this property . the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language is available if you know that a particular application sends text in a different language than the one in the working environment .
to use all the properties in the speaker area closest to the following , click the standard speaker button and then use speaker which is closest to the following .
in this case , 0 is for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify a job number . ( without the order number the input 0 is required ) .
kt@@ m@@ gr crashes immediately when it is started . I have compiled de@@ bug support , but I do not get trace@@ ability .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is crashing and kt@@ ops ; it is finished . you probably have to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not solved by this , you may need a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application . if I receive a text order , it freezes . a . on the &amp; Con@@ sole ; appears a message stating : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
there is a problem on your system that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA , which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . please refer to the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the Internet . I installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ m@@ gr shows this voice .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ale d / fes@@ tival@@ int / vocal . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developers .
on the audio card audio there is a setting speed . in order for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and be discover@@ able via the environment variable PAT@@ H . some syn@@ th@@ esi@@ ze modul@@ s such as Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed even on the card for subscri@@ ber devices . depending on the selected voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speech speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ops ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) Dis@@ able either the filter for the conversion of &amp; html ; ( see ) or , if you are very brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ according to the SS@@ ML @-@ per@@ form@@ er@@ filter , and set up the speech speed .
I don &apos;t make it that websites are read with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker , but respect@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . to make festival no errors , the x@@ s@@ l file re@@ jects the GEN@@ DER tags for converting SS@@ ML to S@@ but the GEN@@ DER tags . the same applies to the VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added an own label asser@@ tion filter and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ ops ; no more set @-@ up or going back . on the card tur@@ ner jobs is displayed , the order consists only of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) are not allowed to filter out . instead , use a filter for character limit detection for these characters .

before you &amp; kt@@ ops ; use , check first if your voice syn@@ thesizer works properly . follow the instructions that you have received with the syn@@ thesizer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good and multiple voices and languages are supported .
you need to install at least one language . help find help in the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read web pages , you must install the ( male ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on .
this voice pres@@ upp@@ oses Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stage of development . if you set up the software in festival / li@@ b / vocals / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the voices of MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding as for example co@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions . therefore , look for the festival as the first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech language , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic as for example co@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Syn@@ thesizer . then festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generated from it the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; not a full voice output system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from di@@ ph@@ onic files . you need additional software to create this Di@@ phone . Festival generates this from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also generate from German lyrics Di@@ phone . more information can be found under .
in this process , additional wra@@ pper code is added to the Festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Vo@@ ices to voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ votes are not installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folders but in the Fol@@ der Festival / li@@ b / .
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Vo@@ ices . required is either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival from
instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , playing the error correction is not necessary , you only need to re @-@ translate the festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / li@@ b / sit@@ em@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; which allows management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create a simple interface for the user :
after installation , a new module Network Set@@ ting is displayed in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the network settings module ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network Set@@ ting in &amp; K@@ Menu ;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to allow &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all displays and allows setting of network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices will be installed and installed . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by custom@@ izing the following files according to the kernel version :
the network settings module is loaded when the Network Set@@ ting option is selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; index . when starting the network settings , this attempts to automatically detect the system used on the system .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the dealer selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which corresponds best to distribution and release status . by selecting the setting of non @-@ re @-@ questions , setting can be made permanently .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , meaning the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in system management mode , you can enter the system management mode at the right bottom of the module by clicking on the system management mode . it is required to enter the password .
in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three tabs :
the network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed :
the settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... in the dialog Device setup .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options .
with the selection Automati@@ cally , the TCP / IP settings are taken from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings are executed for the system at the same time with the start of the system services . the DH@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at every system start , therefore no further setting is required . in the selective list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
with the selection Manu@@ ell , without dh@@ c@@ p or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration can be made . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified .
if this option is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface during boot . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog will be shown as the characteristics of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . ping in the console , you can see if the address is already in use . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or disabled , depending on their needs . switching on an out@@ dated network device is enabled by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
network devices can be activated or disabled , depending on their needs . disable an activated network device by selecting from the list and de@@ activating interface ....
specifies the host &apos;s IP address in the local sub@@ net which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network where the gateway computer is located .
a host with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the host requests ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS will trigger this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution part of the name resolution machine allows you to easily manage this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records can be re@@ arranged by selecting an entry or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the kno@@ bs in or down in the priority list .
by clicking on the Add ... button from the batch machine to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will display the New Name Server dialog .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will be inserted in the list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Calcul@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; group choose one entry and then click the Edit button . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of name @-@ known hosts describes the host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address @-@ reference for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used during boot , if no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers .
usually the list contains some known hosts some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . this version of IP which is still in the test is to replace version 4 in the future .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and click Add ... Add the New Ali@@ as dialog .
enter the name of the well @-@ known computer and click the Add button . if the well @-@ known computer has multiple alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a named calcul@@ ator from the list and select Edit ... Edit the dialog you want to edit .
it can be performed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the network settings are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , must be set in a &amp; console ; the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it suff@@ ices when &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the pre@@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with a graphical interface like a package or the installation tool of its distribution .
in this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and other things .
this is recommended only to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile and compile . the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , and in the second section , all configuration files are discussed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf .
this area cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC is conveyed into a small ( home ) network .
IP networks are currently being run with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 6 has never found widespread dis@@ semination . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . therefore , this description is currently focusing on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is to be assigned . in foreign networks , at the &amp; eg ; the network administrator is the contact person who has a valid IP address or , if available , DH@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address cannot be chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up a separate small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , therefore any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be made possible by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , addresses are usually used in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special purposes , i.e. 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called default route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own computer ) .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle .
this section contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connection , so it is not surprising if there is a different content than specified in the case of active DSL connections .

a PO@@ SIX compliant &amp; UNIX ; for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ ron@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX ; to learn time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar , which also provided dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for quick , selective packing . the second purpose was to answer a question my wife provided : how much longer does it take to secure ?
before a tape can be used , it must be mounted by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can happen in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; trains the tape back and reads the pre@@ st@@ ressing information of the tape . detects &amp; k@@ dat ; don &apos;t recognize the pre@@ tension on the tape , you will be asked if the tape should be format@@ ted .
detects &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre@@ fix , searches for the appropriate index on your disk . if it cannot be found , you will be asked if the index index should be re@@ generated .
when everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched by fl@@ aps of the entry for the band .
before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to do this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; indicates by changing the symbol for the tape that the integration for the tape has been solved and displays a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ;
a band type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . if your tape drive requires format@@ ting a tape before use , this must happen before you can be format@@ ted by the tape of &amp; k@@ dat ; flo@@ ppy disk drives usually require format@@ ting of the tape , but DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the band name and capacity , it continues with the format of the tape . all data on the tape is lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the band is automatically mounted and is ready to use .
before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile will be backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select Save ...
once the backup has been initiated , the dialog opens for backup . in this dialog , you can once again check the selected files and change the backup settings .
when you confirm the settings dialog , the dialog appears . the dialog displays the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
right @-@ click on one of the archives and select the menu entry Veri@@ fy ....
once the test process has been started , the dialog for Veri@@ fication will appear . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for the check .
if you have confirmed the settings for the check , the dialog appears to Veri@@ fy . this dialog displays the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can initiate restore , the files you want to restore must be selected . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore in the File menu .
once the restore process has been started , the dialog for Recovery will appear . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery .
if you have confirmed the restoration settings , the Rest@@ ore dialog appears . this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recre@@ ate the index file with the contents of the tape . this process will delete all existing index files for this band . you can create the index in two ways :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder where the backup is to take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder .
for all files listed in backup files , only the files located in the same file system will be backed up , such as the folder . folders that are located on other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be registered separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independently from the others .
to establish which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only files that have changed since then are backed up .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snapshot file before calling tar . this will cause all files to be backed up and create a new snapshot file for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time the documentation was created .
you can set the settings via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must point to the non @-@ re@@ un@@ winding variant of the tape device .
if this setting is active , it transm@@ its &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is inserted , the command is m@@ apped to the drive . for some drives , this is necessary before read or write operations can be performed .
if the option is switched on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; to block the disc@@ ard from the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work for all tape drives .
if the option is switched on , the tape will automatically be dis@@ mounted when un@@ installing &amp; k@@ dat ; do not use this option for flo@@ ppy streams .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . whether this setting is active or not , you must &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case tell the block size for your tape drive .
when &amp; k@@ dat ; a band format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows :
the format of this string is the name : seconds , where the name is the complete name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time the tape has been format@@ ted .
the band id is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives that can be used directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup band . this symbol is only active when a tape is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; ist ein &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to receive information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files . in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users quick access for example on information about issues that appear on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the log files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to receive information about your system or where the system places the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log allows experienced users to quickly access information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore , try to provide some advanced features that can be used to filter and evaluate the log files of certain programs .
the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . this includes :
support for many different types of log files , for the Sy@@ slo@@ g server format , and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log provides functions with which the individual protocol lines of a log file can be easily filtered and sorted . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after startup , try &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first , open the most important log file of the system - the system log . if it is not displayed to you , you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very likely not with system administrator privileges . the log files are usually found under Linux in the / var / log directory , for which normal users usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criterion or input string . the list of the log lines will now be changed automatically so that only the log lines that match the selected filter will be displayed . in the default setting , the sel@@ ector contains the entry in addition to the filter . then a log line will only be displayed when the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns .
you can of course select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term is then matched only with the entries in the selected column . for example , select the process column in the protocol file system log , and also enter the name of a process in the filter bar , so show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all log lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is activated in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . log lines of level errors are displayed with a more con@@ spic@@ uous color than minutes lines of level indication . the color presentation of minutes lines can be disabled setup dialog .
if you want to show only certain process ( for example in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . for example , this can be useful if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case use filter strip .
in addition , you can activate the option to new lines in the main window context menu to display all new protocol lines added .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows you to display multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub @-@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log in the menu to view the display .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ org D@@ ort you will find further up @-@ to @-@ date information on the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; Subversion repository : k@@ system@@ log ; im &amp; k@@ de ; archive
welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the system V In@@ it quickly becomes the standard for the control of the program start when bo@@ oting the system in &amp; Linux ; this is because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it .
I won &apos;t go into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the In@@ it binary file is located under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and re@@ format@@ ting .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ s@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for each system service you want to start when you run the system or change to another running level . system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc . system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls are part of r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be located under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file even if you don &apos;t have much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a serial port on boot .
the kernel searches for in@@ it at different places and starts the first one to find .
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following in the beginning area :
at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the pres@@ et Run@@ level 3 is 3 . if you want to change this , you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . be very careful if you have made changes to the in@@ it@@ tab .
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that in this folder there are no right files . instead , each entry here is a short@@ cut to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how does it start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts manually on the command line like this :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it includes a K , the script will be inv@@ oked with the argument stop . if it includes an S , the script will be inv@@ oked with the argument start .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; a server @-@ run@@ level , which can only run ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; I could also have a user @-@ run @-@ level , the &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not tell tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ ways to start it at this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between run@@ time or change the position within one level by pulling it somewhere else . this will be removed from its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) . this will only happen if they extract an entry from the range of available system services .
note : entries are moved if you drag them into a new area . to only copy them to a new Run@@ level , you have to explicitly select from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste it into the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you will need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service .
note : at present there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the Tab@@ ul@@ ator key to activate the different work areas ( Avail@@ able system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to move an entry into another round @-@ level , move it into the clip@@ board with cut @-@ out ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and add it to the desired Run@@ level with In@@ sert ( using C@@ trl ; V ) .
to manually change the sorting number or name of an entry , press the Enter key to change the Properties dialog . use the Tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before running .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if available . otherwise , they are recovered from &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; recovered . changes to pres@@ ets are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard running level@@ n@@ s. and now the machine re@@ starts constantly . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in the single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have some system services provided with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions is simpli@@ fying the configuration for the proprietary configuration programs of these distri@@ butions but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution , please check if all configuration files are available that are required by the respective system service ( and also whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply end without a message if their configuration files are not present or incorrect .
the importance of the &amp; Linux ; run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , may even be different from version to version . if you use a different distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level , so that it can be added to this manual .
this documentation is based on &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; to begin , it is sufficient to read the chapter adjustment of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after making changes you need to save it . either use the corresponding toolbar icon or the save entry in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two flash@@ cards , the user group and the user group list . for editing , select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry .
some flash@@ cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only if you have enabled space constraints ( quota ) for users , a card card will be created on which you can customize individual settings . other flash@@ cards appear if Shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD Uni@@ xes .
the card card password management will appear if Shadow passwords , such as / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d , are installed as in BSD Uni@@ xes .
this flash@@ card only appears if space limitation ( quota ) is activated and initi@@ alized for at least one @-@ in file system ( recognizable by the file quot@@ as user / quot@@ as group on the file system ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , whereby the space constraints are respectively in KB :
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected using the file system file system with space limitation .
the map group informs about the group affili@@ ation of the selected user . the default group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Pri@@ mary group field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field .
the Di@@ alogue Properties of the Group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the user or group menu or click the appropriate Add button of the toolbar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group will work an@@ alog@@ ously .
with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add , remove and modify the boot password , change time to boot from the standard operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , modify , and more .
