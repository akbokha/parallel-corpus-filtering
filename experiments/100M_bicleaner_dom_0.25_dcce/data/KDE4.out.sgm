<seg id="1">"" "translate the" "" "translate website" "" "to the & konqueror; -menu under Extras website. select from the drop-down list the source and target language of the translation." ""</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated in place of the entire & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translations are only very rudimentary. babelfish produces in the best case a crude translation and in the worst case nonsense.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated to the Babelfish page itself, where you can insert translated texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">Package & package; contains various modules for & konqueror; despite their small size, they provide some additional features and simplify the use of some functions of & konqueror; making them available easier.</seg>
<seg id="6">Further information on how to use & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual on & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror, select Add how to add extensions.... Open the card card tools and select the required modules there.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of default settings from the kde; addons package. please note that there may be more modules installed on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, which contains & konqueror before compiling this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click on Tools crashes. then you can view the page, the & konqueror; crash, or the list of crashes, if available, delete.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Analogue filter module (also called folder filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras Analog Filters. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed web page. as default, the display begins with the top of the document, for example: documentet, all other nodes are subelements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; displays a further view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory on local files. it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & FSView is to graphically represent nested folder hierarchies using a so-called tree map. tree-maps allow representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose area is proportional to its size.</seg>
<seg id="15">With & FSView; displays the size of a file or folder, whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries. in this way, large files can easily be identified, even if they are far below the folder hierarchy. therefore, & FSView can be viewed as a graphic and interactive version of the & UNIX command.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; an entry in the Treemap representation is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your file system. for easier navigation, the rectangles have sensible color and label settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle that is switched over View Color Mode can display either depth for easy recognition of the nesting depth or the representation of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the respective file or folder. for each property, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough room to display it or whether the area of subordinate rectangles should be used (whereby, therefore, representation errors occur by constraints on the sign of the Treemap). furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the label in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">For Treemap configuration algorithms, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. in the Treemap in & FSView, this goal is not always complied with. frames are drawn to display the nesting of the entries, and that frame will need space, which is no longer available for the frame, if the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How segmentation of the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation is left to the implementation. here it is always advantageous for the labeling and avoidance of space losses through frameworks in such a way that rectangles are created that are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are rows, columns or recursive branches.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can set the minimum displayed area for an entry on the menu entry View on area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally, & FSView was intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widgets designed for KCachegrind application.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Picture Gallery module can be found in the & konqueror; -menu under Extras image gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the Picture Gallery module, a dialog opens with which you can set the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field.</seg>
<seg id="26">The images per line has a slider and a rotational field to set the number of thumbnails of each line in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">With the check box File Name of the image, you can specify whether the file names are displayed in the gallery under the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the check box file size of the image, you can specify whether the file size is displayed in the gallery under the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="29">With the check box image size, you can specify whether the size of the images is displayed in the gallery under the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the Folder folder, specify where the gallery is stored and which subfolders are to be included.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the file chooser Save to HTML-file, specify where to store the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the check box subfolder, you can set with a slider or a control panel, to which level the subfolders are included.</seg>
<seg id="33">Copy original images with the check box to see if the original images should be copied to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">With the check box comments file, you can specify a comment file for the caption of images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box, you can specify a different color depth for the thumbnails than in the original images.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; -Settings allows you to easily access the general & HTML; -Settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; -Settings can be found in the & konqueror; -menu under Tools HTML settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">The media playback for the navigation pane can be found in the & konqueror; -menu in the navigation pane window or with the keyboard shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click on the & konqueror's navigation area, and drag the music files you want to listen to in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Change browser detection add a menu entry in & konqueror; add to which you can change browsing and operating system identifiers for individual domains. this is helpful for web pages that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The default browser recognition of the & konqueror; is compatible with Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a web page that refuses to access this browser, change browser detection in one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the encryption feature in MSIE for pages that deny access to browsers based on Mozilla. for example, you need MSIE browser recognition to call the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not correspond to the W3C standard or use your own & HTML; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identification of this outdated browser.</seg>
<seg id="44">With this option, the set browser recognition is used for all pages of the site you are currently visiting.</seg>
<seg id="45">By setting up menu entry... you can set the scope of the information on the browser used and the operating system in the individual.</seg>
<seg id="46">With this & konqueror; -module check your & CSS; style sheets and & HTML; -Documents in accordance with W3C's recommendations and other standards.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into & digikam; download albums. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gphoto2 library. of course, any media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digikam; contains a fast image processing with basic image editing tools. you can use these to view, comment, comment and correct your photos. the processing capabilities can be easily expanded with KDE Image plug-ins interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digikam, easy to use, it provides dozens of professional capabilities. it works complete in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion by libraw, DNG export and ICC color management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with significantly more metadata, such as & eg; on the camera or the lens to search for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs are also digitised; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of end users. they should therefore report problems and improvement opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="60">This opens a dialog with a underlined link. if you use these links, your web browser will open a page in the error report system. all the information you need is entered here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digikam; is a project supported by a community. that is, the user and developer can help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we would like to invite you to other users of & digikam; you can ask here questions to other users of & digikam; however, in this mailing list English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful in this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digicode; visit the homepage to find news about shared versions and other information about & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to get to & digikam; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for signing in the developer mailing list by & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you first boot, you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database. you can specify a local, remote or removable folder here. just enter path names or click the Folder icon folder to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field, you will need to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data log is stored. this path stays the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & digikam; will additionally be used as an alumeric library.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder containing images as a base folder. & digikam; view each subfolder as an album. no picture is being changed. while browsing the folders, you get a progress indicator like this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& digikam; needs recursively the library path in its full depth. you can not close any subfolders unless it is hidden in hidden folders. this allows you to create extra bs & digikam; complete by inserting a dot in front of the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albentab do not have photos as icons. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and putting it on the folder icon. more details can be found in the Album section.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can digitize your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use My Albums and keyword list to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you are using the raw mode of your camera, it may be possible to handle it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the section Roh-DecoderSettings and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into & digikam; download albums. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gphoto2 library. of course, any media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera then appears as a disk drive. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may also use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digikam; uses the gPhoto2 program to communicate with digital camera. gPhoto2 is a free, distributed software collection for digital cameras that supports an ever increasing number of more than 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos are generally large files and transmissions over the serial port are slow, this connection is now obsolete. & digikam; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support so that the thumbnails can be read out reliably by some libgphoto2 camera operators. if the if support is not present in libgphoto2, you might not be able to see thumbnails or the creation might be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things on & digikam, is how simple its functionality can be extended by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI Module: the KDE Image Plug-in Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digikam;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and GwenView. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way how it can be a user. their advantage is that it is much easier & digitized; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes were in & digikam; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB; or change to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drag and drop pictures works everywhere: you can put an image in a different part of the almine, above the horizontal dividing line or into another application window. the only constraint is that a picture can not be put into keywords, date list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to emphasize the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. thus, the filter on the filename only works if this ind or symbol view is also displayed. which fields can be displayed you can configure in the dialog of the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos managed by & digikam; managed are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard disk, sorted by the name of their collection in the album properties or by the date on which the album was first created.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select album Imporate images. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album. select album Imporate screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it. in the pop-up menu, you will need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album properties, right-click on the album and edit the album properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album- collections: are a method to select your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection from you will be used to sort your photos, if you want to add collections from the toolbar or view albums by Collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do so in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The Buttons Elders, Mean, New Year: these set the date on the oldest, the newest picture or the average of the album. to do this, first try to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first have an album in & edited; open, the first image in the album is selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; This is to help you remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album symbol, select the image with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu & quot; As album display "quot;." in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be contained in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digikam; supports typing keywords for individual photos in the My Keyword list at the bottom of the main window. album collections have another effect. the collection always includes all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window provides you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images in this album will be displayed in the image window. each photo will be displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of these preview with the two magnifying glass buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you have to wait a little while the preview images are generated. this can be avoided by regenerating all preview images from the Extras menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information on each image will be displayed below the corresponding preview. what information this is, you can edit the settings; set up. select the Albums Page and customize the preview window to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails feature help windows that appear. the help displays the most important features including all of the keywords in a photo. the screenshot at the top of the introduction to the main window shows a help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are everything about & digikam; works. albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it fits you. the image processing displays your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements. you can select all the functions that came with & digikam; you can choose between viewing the images, a slide show or the editing of the images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by selecting either F4 Picture Edit... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and Edit... Select. in the editing pane, you will find instructions on how to edit your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">It may happen that & digikam; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub-menu of opening. to do this, and how to adjust it to your needs, if your program is not listed, see the & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after processing by other image processing programs, problems with the metadata contained in the picture can occur. some programs do not store these data when you save the modified image. this information is lost from EXIF and IPTC data such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digikam; provides two options for turning. the easiest is to right-click on the preview and select Turning. in the sub-menu, you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, right-click on the preview and select F2 Rename from the context menu. keep in mind that you maintain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you want to remove a photo from & edit it, it will be moved in the trash bin by & kde; F8 Picture Delete or Del if you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift. Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">The view & quot; My Datumslider; organizes your photos using the data. & digikam; uses either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of the last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view to show you only the photos of the selected days.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keyword add a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. once a keyword is assigned a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Keywords can be sorted into a hierarchical tree. this allows you to logically organize your keywords. you can also find parts of the tree & quot; My Keyword listequot; to work together so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and allocated keywords in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG, so you can also use your keywords in other programs. in addition, the key words are re-imported as soon as they are digitized; the images are noticed.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by clicking with the right mouse button either on & quot; My keyword, or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword. if you add a new keyword, after clicking on an existing keyword, this will become the subtitle of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by drag it to the desired position in the tree and drop it there. then a menu appears, which gives you the possibility to move the keyword. a keyword can only be in the tree at a time.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by right-clicking and editing the keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My keyword.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album symbol, you must click the image with the right mouse button and set it as album preview in the context menu. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">This can happen in two ways: as soon as you select the photos that you want to tag with a keyword you can drag them to the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My keyword. alternatively, you can also right-click on the thumbnail of the pictures and select keywords from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can select a photo with any number of keywords. the photo will be shown once you select one of the keywords added to it. in this way, you can select a keyword for each person in a photo, one for the location where the photo was taken, one for the event where it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have completed a photo with keywords, it will be shown in the main window under the preview of the image.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword by right-clicking the context menu of the photo and selecting Remove from the drop-down menu. the menu only shows you the keywords attached to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view shows a timespanable histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection box can be moved using this histogram. to select a timeframe, just click on the bottom rectangle of the selection box to specify the time unit. this will display all associated images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the box below you can enter a title and save your selection. it then appears in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Includes all elements of the database: names, ratings, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and in the future even more.</seg>
<seg id="125">Next to the search box is a small lamp the green becomes when the search finds matches. if you click here the filtering is deleted and all pictures are displayed again. if the search does not find anything, then the lamp becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left sidebar with binoculars. if you open this you get a simple search box as described above. you can save this search here but as a live search, which always filters what you entered as search criterion.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are happy with your selection, hit the head OK and the search will be performed. the search field is used to view my search list in the main window. if you want to change your selection after the search again, you only need to select the corresponding entry from the view My search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">If you select Edit Search, the search form will appear again with the search information previously entered. if you select Advanced Search, the dialog for advanced search appears to change your previous search. here you will find more rules for the search. for more information, see section The tool for Advanced Search.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Delete in the context menu search.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced Search provides you with an advanced search form with many search parameters you can search for in certain fields of & digikam; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the database. an option can be added to this list using search group / search group added or deleted from it. each option can be linked with other via logical operations All..., One..., No... or At least....</seg>
<seg id="132">& digikam; characterized each image by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows images to compare by comparing these signatures. the smaller the difference between two picture signatures, the more they correspond to each other. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area where you can drop each image to find a similar. if you slide a picture from somewhere on the symbol of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar, it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free-hand colour sketch: draw a fast sketch and & digikam; find the right pictures. also here a threshold value can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can zoom in or zoom in or hold it. move it while you press the left mouse button. press Ctrl; left mouse button to move a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your geo filter. it will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a live geodata folder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digikam; creates a luminaire in a separate window that allows you to easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L to add the luminous table from the context menu. the selection will be added to the luminaire and opened its window. if you are back in & edit the main window, you can quickly open the lamp table with L Extras luminaire.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview bar, you can drag and drop the images you want to compare in the left or right pane of the window. if you select Preview Synchronization from the toolbar, and perform zoo and shooting operations on one of the images, then they are also executed on the other picture. so you can compare the same area of both images.</seg>
<seg id="140">A different mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images. if you use pair mode to navigate from the toolbar, the first two images are automatically loaded into the areas to compare. the picture to the right is displayed in the right pane. this simplifies working through a series of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal deletion actions also work directly from the luminaire like e.g. F4 file Edit....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right sidebar of the main window is available for both preview images in the light table. for example, this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom end of each area you will find a built-in pan function that you can see on the crossed arrows. to wave the visible area of the image, you have to click it and hold the & LMB; in the preview mode, then both images will display the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zooming works just like in other views. just use the zoom knob under the images or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out. this happens in both pictures when you are in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital inventory management - away from the fashion word? digital stock management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken to the final issue and permanent storage. each of the photos takes up, scans or digitally records digital photos. most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures, find, protect and use photos. we view the download, rename, remove, convert, group, back, evaluate, archive, archive, optimize, wait and export image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital inventory management takes up, indexed, categorized, secures, seeks, transforms, confuses and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is, in accordance with your definition, data that provides information on or a documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">If you don't even know how many photos you have, then you do not use & digikam. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then use a very fast search and secure archiving that you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate anything into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you have to decide if you want to save them to a dedicated drive or on a network drive & etc.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. vacation pictures can be quickly found about your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place. if you do enough photos, then you will use subfolders like & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; export is then a folder for images you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning of photos, archiving, workflow, constant supply of images to different subjects and a large number of everything. within 10 years, 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? separating file types makes batch processing easier. separate new files from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derivative image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend that you save the metadata in & edited the metadata in the Settings page. this ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are written to the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding item in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change them? edited & edited; they have a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, because you should now assign keywords, captions and an evaluation to each photo. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value. you start best with the rating or ranking. this makes sense, since you can focus on the best photos during further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Now let's continue with keywords, keywords, as you frequently refer to other programs or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digikam; automatically build the tree for you or paste the images to the right place. the sorting of the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can be done easily by dragging a sub-tree to another. the changed words are edited by & digikam; updated while it tracks the subtree.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata is overlapped. this is a very rough representation, since each block of metadata consists of many sections. file names and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to captions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You just want to let most people see your photos, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. you're sure you're interested in how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it closer, then you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you this the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beacherin; in the French Normandie 60 years after landing. wow! you begin to dream of having associations, memories, the historical time span is again present, you may even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who look at your photos, the title may be more important than the picture itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help Him through the motive that moves you has to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is alright if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with an inscription for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digikam, you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as lettering. you can even set it for a selection of images at the same time. KDE even provides you with a spell checker.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find another city without a navigation system? was it Earth not a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of spatial presentation now drives already with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of exploiting geolocation are countless and will become even more profound in the future. I am sure one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your travel by using images with geographic indications.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a pun with copyright and denotes the practice of using copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all modified versions, so also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information on the setup page of & digikam, as information should be stored:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization can be used. this field does not support commas or semicolons as separators.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author's title (synonym for author's line): linked to the author. this field contains the photographer's job description. examples of this may be titles such as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for providers): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer works for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here, which offers the picture to others.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they do not provide protection against misuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or change the metadata embedded in the picture. for individuals, this is only of little interest to the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per picture. & digikam; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: record errors, plate failure, power surges, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, desasterprevention, life time, temperature, data size, spread superstition</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire. these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section we are dealing with problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the world's largest data recovery firm, has some interesting statistics which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs, these cautious issues must be handled and you can't trust you for more than a couple of years. of course, you can also purchase CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers about Gold-coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 that claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can become unreadable but you can reduce this risk by using good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors even when you have just written. that's why they use a checksum mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and checksums. despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CD and DVDs there is a convenient program called IsoBuster which seems to cause miracles for CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks, hard disks, flash drives, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to capture the format war against HD DVD. a dual layer Blu-ray disc can store 50 GB and thus nearly six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that was said on CDs and DVDs is also valid for the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Your manufacturer's warranties include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives on this subject: floppy case study</seg>
<seg id="187">Electronic parts of the controller are the most common error cause, SMART cannot detect these errors. some errors ascertained by SMART indicate the immediate termination of failure. this is especially read errors and disposal counters. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the total loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files, but these losses can usually be recovered without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices do not make much noise, it looks different in devices with computer chips and high-speed processes. these can cause severe damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause blocked keyboards, complete data loss, hardware aging, damaged Motherboards and other defects. protect yourself from the unavoidable loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against spikes is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs a part of the energy heat and grooves the rest. it is usually available in the form of a connector.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also take care that it provides protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">As an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should ensure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are also protected. some manufacturers produce overvoltage contactors which also have a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a laptop, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially designed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the modem protection.</seg>
<seg id="194">While a overvoltage protection protects your system against minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in a complete failure. even a loss of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in a break-free power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltage, these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs. some models allow you to save your data and keep the system shut down. if you purchase a UPS then you should be sure that they comply with the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security in case of electricity problems with the cost of avoiding this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can cost you up to & euro; 20 costs, A 500W USV can be used for less than €40.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can use it as a drive on & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are however very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send the data about the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only a solution to a local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are fed to photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data security, the web solutions are very safe. transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol, and in the large firms it contains a backup and a distributed memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer. all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors. the ZFS and btrfs file system ensures at least the data integrity between the operating system and the hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when this happened in your hardware. all these interruptions remain undiscovered until you have one day open a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise. no one seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, as they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not currently affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle plate errors at low levels and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon be available for Linux; and Windows. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started an own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. this is still in alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms that ZFS is used and is also available for Linux; but it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss on notebook and 46% in workstation systems. in notebooks, the share of thefts amounts to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to lower damage, such as theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no one has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFs and XFS to name the most widespread file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: false, only the speed of the investigation process at a sudden interruption during surgery is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file has not been completely stored before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: false, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical boundaries. it is meant that while technology continues to develop there is a natural barrier to this advancement. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go in the direction of 10 megapixel cameras. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is worse. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard disk will get you today for 100 & euro; so do not blame anybody else for data loss. so backup your data often according to a plan and test this backup before you make any hazardous like re-installing your operating system, the exchange of disks or the resizing of disks.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backup daily on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a lightning strikes you will be lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget airplane accidents: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore disaster prevention is always a non-local storage. bring your backups up the stairs, into the neighbor's house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above, a common cause for data loss despite securing the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Full backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential lock: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot at two time points: the one of the complete backup and that of the last differential lock.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. creates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup has been made.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference of files that have been really changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup key images directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or other optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure allows you enough time to uncover and restore losses. at the same time, you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. any further dilution should happen manually after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata in which image file stored IPTC information, associated XMP files, original retain, memory, scalability, media, reinventing images and metadata, copying images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing tools,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">In order for valuable pictures to survive the next 40 years that is approximately the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be observed:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re-evaluate as time goes by. unfortunately, you should ask yourself how the current system is compatible backwards. the less variants you used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">So virtualization is available for everyone. so if you have an old system that is important to read your images, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist print for the ability to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planed the scalability and want to enlarge the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. with * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and relocate it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new disk was recognized by the system, but don't hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollars; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the disk in MBO; # works with ext2.3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of the drive if needed</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no software that can read it, you can create it yourself. this task is easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you shouldn't use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG is designed as an open source standard which should replace GIF. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16 bits per color channel and full transparency. PNG is able to store Gamma- and Chromaticity data for improved color assignment for heterogeneous platforms.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF is widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). however, with some cameras you can save your images in this format. however, a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The digital Negative file format is a royalty-free and open file format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed based on the TIFF / EP format and committed to the use of metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers are already available DNG and we hope that the competitor Canon and Nikon will use it at some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; image resource block quot; technology of the 90s. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording, mostly in raw format. XMP fits because it stores metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file, and as mentioned above, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization that supports fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in DCMI communities and DCMI communities, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a far-reaching acceptance of meta standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images on the camera are edited, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save it to your raw archive. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For fine editing, you can use external programs. if you edit the images with & digikam, edit, then you should add the metadata again.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the edited images for copyright using a digital watermark. export them then in web galleries, coding in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digikam. in the addition of a photos to an album, you will find a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for importing images to your albendatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digikam; to use, connect it to the computer, switch the camera to the display mode and turn on. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">If you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. if the connection is established, a ready-indicator at the bottom end and thumbnails of all photos on the camera will appear. some cameras do not display preview images. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for the application will be displayed on the camera for each file, photos, movies, music, etc.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the sidebars features and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and the photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The tab metadata shows the internal metadata such as exif, manufacturer notice, GPS, etc of the image. this information is the same as the metadata page bar from the main window of & digikam, or image processing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button download and then download the selection of all. this will download all photos from their camera into a single album in & edited;. downloading the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, you can only select the desired with the standard selection methods from & kde. once you have selected the photos, use the button Download and then download Selected. download the Selected button as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, a new option is available for download. in this case the new images are marked with a star in the preview window. if you select this option, only the new pictures will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you download the All-Download or Selected buttons, a dialog appears with which you can select the destination album in which the photos are stored. you can read the list of the existing albums in the My Albums section. select the destination album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you selected the target album, press OK, and & edited; load the photos from the camera into the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete it from the camera. you can delete all at once by deleting the Delete All button. if you just want to delete some, you need to select them first and then delete selected delete.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera. you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully downloaded into a & edited; they should be completely deleted before you delete them from the camera. if you want to completely delete the camera bug, you should do so via the camera system, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras often do not use very meaningful names as filenames for the photos. the filenames are usually re-used after the photos are deleted from the camera. this can lead to duplicate filenames if you upload photos from different shooting galleries to the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been taken into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for database-based subtitles. if you use this latter option, a folder will be created automatically per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the commit opens three other options, which are performed before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two concern the data on the author in the Standard Car Identity section. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the exif information to the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want a different date format than the standard format, e.g. in the editing field, you can use the prefix photo-%%%% d% H:% M:% S. to do this, turn on the date & time option. for further modifications, you should read the help of the strftime command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera filename, you have the option of modifying the file names in lowercase letters. or in uppercase, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & edited; used for a photo, is displayed below the name the camera provides in preview. your settings to rename are saved and used automatically when you next open the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digikam; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera at the time of recording to perform automatic rotation during downloading. not all cameras provide this information. in the Metadata section, you can read more about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">Automatic rotation is usually switched on, and if your camera does not deliver this information, & digikam, the photo is in its original orientation. if you want to switch off the automatic turn, use the Advanced button and select the Automatic Rotation in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available, & digikam, you can use this to automatically load sub-albums in the target album by downloading. all images with the same date are loaded into the same subtitle. not all cameras provide this information. in the Meta data section, you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually switched off, and in this case it stores & digitised; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to switch this option. to do so, use the Advanced button and select the date-based subverbs at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the download button. then select upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the selection is done, ask & digikam; you see where the images are to be uploaded. select the folder you want and click OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted by your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this means a position indicated in longitude and latitude and can be displayed on a map. determining the data can be carried out by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural firms and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten later where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser to indicate the area. if you want to send a postcard to another, users want to locate the location of the photo, or simply want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position information of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data get into the picture? first you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields such as direction, semitrailings and map references. the question is actually more like the data in these fields? there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via post processing of the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographical allocation (manual) and last via the manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few who work with GPS receivers. either as a card module or by transmitting data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you need to save these data in the gpx format, since this is the only format supported by the geographical allocation module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract and correlate the data of images and GPS. on the following page you can use the same under & Linux; gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know longitude and latitude or other data, then you can use this script that works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the templates created by maps.google for example.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European road maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, that show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& nbsp; tries to give you so much control over his work processes as possible. there are many settings that the behavior of & digikam; change. to access these settings, you need to edit in the Settings menu; set up. the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be set to preview or start image editing. you set the default behavior of & digikam; specify when you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the identity and copyright data. these data are automatically written into the corresponding IPTC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface. also with a database synchronization, these data are written into the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author's title is a synonym for author's line: this field should contain the professional designation of the photographer. this can be designations such as a photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the author field, it must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify the name of the photo. this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here as this is the picture of others & quot;.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the corresponding IPTC field. this ensures that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of & digikam; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be edited and edited without getting lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Image captions saved as embedded labels (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the inscriptions embedded in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse pointer rests over a file in the main window. depending on the selected option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digikam; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digikam; tries to display, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list.</seg>
<seg id="292">You can reset the default settings by pressing the Refresh button on the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the light table by & digikam; can be set on this page to the default values. each time you open the light table these settings are switched on. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available. the option & quot; In the entire image size ladenquot; should you have one, then you can get better visible results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer another color, you can select it here. you can turn off the toolbar if you are using the image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the picture. these colors are specified here. in image processing, this view mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling it is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the colour information. please read this article in Wikipedia for more details.</seg>
<seg id="297">With PNG compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality because PNG is using a lossless algorithm. the only effect is that the image data requires more time for unpacking and unpacking.</seg>
<seg id="298">The TIFF file can be used to compress the default emulsion algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality because the delate algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the adjustment of loss-free JPEG 2000 files, you can save lossless JPEG 2000 files. even if you select the lossy setting, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JPEG. as this paragraph has been written, metadata has not yet been supported but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digikam, the image editing has only been an image viewer for photos. at the moment, it quickly develops into a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog you can change the image editing settings.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default assumption is that all green pixels are the same. if the straight-line green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels on odd lines, this difference creates a grid pattern in the output. this option records the image a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the white balance is not set. standard it is a fixed color balance based on a white card photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensor has the effect that underexposed images in four steps get more details in the sharpness. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default is the pointed lights, so the parts of your pictures that are burned on, due to the inability of your camera to catch the pointed lights, as continuous white. the setting colors will trigger some unusual results because it shows the pointed lights in various shades of roses. last, you can attempt to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general are not so fast saturating like green and red. & dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the still not saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the Reconstruction option, you get the possibility to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably have to set it slightly higher than the default 1. however, this can be done later in the image options of the & digikam; image processing. in order to keep the time for the demosaicing small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the sub-raw data that come from the color-filtered image sensor that has many cameras and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA-Interpolation or colour-construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& nbsp; and Dcraw provide you three alternatives: bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD interpolation. after some tests it looks as if AHD interpolation (for Adaptive Homogenia-Directed) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. however, it produces color artefacts on the edges.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for color grading correction, since it is performed during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again. there is also LCMS and & digikam; information such as the color information from a color space in the others are to translate the colors as precisely as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when a picture is opened in image processing / start color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile Folder Set the folder here, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can save all your profiles. & digikam; examine this folder during startup.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC Profiles You have here the option & quot; standard squot; for your profiles to leave. everything can be changed when opening the raw file.</seg>
<seg id="316">The colour management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures color-managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit the camera creator and model you are using. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which do not contain any color mapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw gamma does not correct conversions at 16 bit depth.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the Soft-Proof-Profile that you can emulate as your image would be given back from a device. this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore have a very saturated color.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite obvious what color profile is provided for. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. of course, this answer is inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile expansion makes it possible to realize the style for the target: F for an exact style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image plugin interface. it is an interface supported by a number of & kde; image viewer and image processing. by providing this interface, & digikam; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has the KIPI modules installed, you will see a list of available modules. select the modules you want to use and these will then be digised; these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information (in English) about KIPI modules, you can get to the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The slide show settings should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between the picture transitions, usually 4-5 seconds good. the other check boxes activate or remove the metadata that are displayed at the bottom of the images during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features show a list of all supported cameras on the left. on the right side there is a button Automatic detection that attempts to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure the camera is connected properly, turned on and in image display mode.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end you can set the path for USB- and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have selected a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera bar.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digikam; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it to the display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">If not, you can manually set the camera model and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera's menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera, which is displayed in the Cameras of the main window. if you have more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the confirmation dialog for moving pictures in the dustbin, you can view & digikam the conversation; to delete a photo in an album. in the sections deleting a photo and deleting an album, you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right sidebar can be used tacitly by & digikam; if you use the option to apply changes in the right sidebar without any queries, you will need to save the changes with the button change.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also display the display of the welcome screen from & digikam, at startup. this speeds up the start-up of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="334">After searching for new photos and digitizing the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos. this lengthens the start time of & digikam; if something was deleted from the base folder, & digikam, you decide if it should delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be edited in & edited; used to customize the main window to your taste. these settings can be selected under Settings Design from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digikam, you will find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digikam; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools. you can use this to view your photos and for correction and improvement. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the display / editing.</seg>
<seg id="338">Image Editing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digikam; so you may not be part of your distribution. more information about the KIPI modules can be found in the Image Processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, the file name, current file number, zoom factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and below the tool bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the image processing change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before using the Save button or the Save button from the toolbar. note that you can't recover the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">You should possibly create a copy of your image before you change it. you can do this with File save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Restore File menu or the Restore button Restore image processing in the toolbar. you will then lose any change that you have done on the photo since the last save.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost every action of image processing can be undone or restored. the last action can be undone by modifying and / or restoring, by selecting Edit Recover from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should use the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z to undo and Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB, press the button or restore button in the toolbar for a moment longer, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu items, all actions in between will be undone or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started editing, you can move between the photos on the same album or the same keyword while using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, picture high, picture down or the entries in the File menu. if you made changes to the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can zoom in and zoom in the photo by using Ctrl; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select Enlarge factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode. you come to the normal view in which you use the Esc key. normally, you can also view the toolbar. if you do not want this, you can view this in the Settings dialog by & digikam; view the main window. see the section for setting up image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, in the File menu, you can print image and get the standard & kde; print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual images or whole phrases. entire image preview pages can be printed from your selection. you just need to select the images using the standard methods and select Print Assistant from the Album menu. if you follow the wizard, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & nbsp; main window has a sidebar at the right edge, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available without the navigation arrows, also in image processing. it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same tab allows the sidebar to appear or disappear again in the margin.</seg>
<seg id="355">The text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the captions are copied to EXIF and IPTC- fields to be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are converted. if you want to use the IPTC label field in other applications, you should consider these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented on it, use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next picture, the captions are then saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the application button, there is a button. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this is always done when you have selected a metadata setting that is always written into the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select it and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC field Urgency. the coding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword list shows a search box for filtering the key words, the keywordpress and a select box with those previously used in this & edited; session applied keywords.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered keyword. you can quickly limit the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword. this ability is particularly useful when you have many key words.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom is a further relief when entering keywords during a series of pictures. if you have typed different keywords, they are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree. all keywords in an image are stored in the keyword IPTC keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword-tree, this will only apply to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection, If you want to add a keyword, please read the Keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The Keyword Keyword filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window. normally, the left sidebar is used with their album, date, keyword and search views. if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two will be displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop keywords. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keyword. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it from the right sidebar and put it on the selection.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day. the Keyword filter is based on No keywords, which reduces the amount to three pictures. they were selected using Ctrl + a, and after that a keyword is drawn from the right keyword-tree to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be disabled under Settings different.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created a rule and note that it should be one or its, you can easily change this by double-clicking on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry that is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, picture, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can set an Advanced search for all elements of the database using the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the group button. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb and Flickr not listed? the free disk space is limited to 1 GB and you won't want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I have mainly adapted it to & digikam; s concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner come with a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor matches those of your camera or scanner and that match the colors you print or publish on the web from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the issue comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you can make informed decisions at any point in the image processing workflows. in addition, you should provide you with sufficient background information on color management. in addition, links with deeper information will allow you to make your own informed decisions to make you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow satisfies all six criteria listed below, you do not have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">They work on a monitor that is calibrated on the sRGB colour space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other picture editions are by email or the web where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should one use another color space and thus have to think about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of limiting sRGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindblooms's excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to stick my monitor when I decided to work only in sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you work in sRGB colour space or not, you need to scale your monitor since sRGB means you are allied to sRGB. if you work as a color space of sRGB then you either need to calibrate your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve one image in most cases. therefore, use it before trying any further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalize, compare, Automatic balance and contrast extend from the menu Correction Automatic correction attempt automatically from your colors to make the best. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the brightness values over the entire image so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point as bright as possible without changing its shade. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed out.</seg>
<seg id="391">Comparing: this method adjusts the brightness-factor of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible. sometimes, the comparison results in very good results in the improvement of the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only garbage. it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in a picture or it destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic comparison: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright shades and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast amplifies contrast: this method improves the contrast and luminous intensity of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the largest possible area and a new iteration of all values in between. this is only visible in washed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool for carrying out white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is slightly limited because of a color space with 8 bits per color. so if you can move too far from the original picture, areas with overexposure may occur. if you can perform the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is copyrighted by Pawel T. Jochym. they start it using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left hand side, both the original image and the preview of the target picture can be viewed. preview will dynamically adjust the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance, then click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target picture has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">At the top right, a histogram shows that dynamic changes are changed once you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels are very small luminance values. with one button you can decide if one of the three colors or your sum is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. shadow adjustment lets you enhance or dimmer the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play stat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. this way the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance to the list of default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will see the combined result in white balance. this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save as and Load buttons do exactly this. any setting of the white balance that you have set you can save it into a text file and load it again later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button returns all filter values to their default values and the associated neutral white balance. note that neutral settings will also result in a different photo than your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better suited for high quality images. however, this coding also requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG formats.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be done by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed instructions for using color profiles can be used to consult the chapter on color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is to find color correction in the menu. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously and allows you to save them for more photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always makes the same error and you always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation, that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digikam; tool color effects provide you with four color effects, a solar installation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was an effect that was created when using a partial pressure of a short flash light and then completed the development of the image. this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. the result was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar process. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. another upliftment ultimately creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar heating effect. the original image is the (1) and edits the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called "Velviaquot" effect. it differs from saturation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simple, it beautifies many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">The name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make it a film of choice for nature photographers.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neon light. in large images the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the luminous intensity of the photos. you can experiment to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjustments can be viewed in preview. once you are satisfied with the result, use the Ok button and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you do a photo in poor light conditions, you can get the opposite problem: a too big saturation. even in this case the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice for reducing saturation instead of increasing it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex mould gradation and the simple luminous thickness / contrast / gamma, the tool is set up to improve exposure. even if the dialog with this tool is very complicated, you only need the area of the slider for the purpose described here. more concrete the three sliders below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of the intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph three sliders are clicked in and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to operate it is to shift the controls and make sure the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right, the original and the preview of the image can be viewed. the preview will be updated dynamically, based on the image settings. on the left hand side, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box it can be set, whether the histogram is represented with a linear or logarithmic y axis. for images of a digital camera the linear representation is often the most useful. in pictures the large ranges of a constant color, the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case the logarithmic division is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knobs: the top one for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle sounds, often called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color brush can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows, middle and bright tones. furthermore, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values interactively as in the input values. for example, the compression of the output values can be used to create a hidden image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons the set values can be stored in the filesystem and loaded later. to do this, the Gimp Levels format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input value is automatically adjusted for all shadows, means and sun shades. check the color pipette you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the input value of the histogram for red, green, blue and luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Overexposure Indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you only get the effect shown in preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of adjusting entry values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand side, half of the original and the target picture will be displayed. the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right side, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel that is changed by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box there are two icons to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images taken with a digital camera, the most sensible is the linear mode. for images with large areas of a constant color, the linear mode produces a wide beam. in this case the logarithmic mode will help.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a shortcut to the right, i.e. the bright tones, you can see that these bright tones correspond to darker tones and that the associated image pixels are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">A red marker is shown on the preview of the original picture. if you want to change this marker to the area you want to change, a matching line will appear on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. each curve you created can be stored in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">When using this method and the three color pipetting buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sun tones. activate the color pipette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The Overexposure Indicator option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if overexposed pixels are found in more than one channel, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you only get the effect shown in preview and there is no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sun shades were placed with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel blender of & digikam; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel blender is another highly developed tool to mix the color tones of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first hint as to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left area of the window will show you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the image has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line in the histogram shows the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are lower right: regulator for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you activate Luminance, the image will keep the general brightness even when you change the appropriate color components. this is particularly convenient if you also use the option Monochrome, since the channel mixer is then THE tool for generating magnificent black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour space. the colour space consists of small noise artefacts that do not appear in the same place in the color channel and their noise pattern in each channel looks different. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the color space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. you can save any blender setting for later and then load it. the file format used is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Overexposure Indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you only get the effect shown in preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the Luminance option is enabled and the original image is shown below (1) and the edited image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your ability to be abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, since color images can easily be converted to the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford Cant4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford Panther Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scene images and fits especially well to portraits against the sky. similarly, like the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filter: simulates black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic sky effects and can simulate lunar scenes at the time of the day. similarly, like the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">This is very similar to the process of bleaching a pressure and the re-development in a sepiate. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With & digikam; apply tool texture you can apply decorative textures to an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, whether it's a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, stitch an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: shifting this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensionality of the texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied on the photo below. the original image is (1) and the changed under (2) to see. the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With & digikam; add tool frame, a decorative frame can be added to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photograph is not an easy task. one way to keep your attention is to set the image a decorative framework. this is a psychological barrier for the looking eye. add to picture frame the module can be started from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image. with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), shkanty surrounds it with a nice three dimensional frame which is ideal for a knock effect and decorative inserts a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: indicates the width of the frame in percent. the value range for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target picture that has been decorated with the frame will be larger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing images, especially if you have used the tool Follow the aspect ratio before.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into a picture at any location. this also goes to several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply insert the text and place it with the mouse. use text direction, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its features as you need them.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press "OK." once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With & digikam; apply mold templates you can place a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The image template menu can be used in image editing can be used to place templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no limitations regarding the size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to reduce the file size of the template. if you want to add your template file, simply send an email in English to the & digikam; mailing list digikam-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your stencil folder with the button base folder in the dialog. here, select the folder where you copied the template files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the templates, a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the Template folder. selecting a folder will automatically update the thumbnail of the templates automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the picture below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this button shrinks the image underneath. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you need to reduce the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below the template. to do so, take the image and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK when you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be adjusted automatically to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digikam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produces, especially in dark areas, grainy pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blurring mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharper. in fact it sharpens no bit, it works rather psychically. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes here a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by copyright by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three because it really improves sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for customization.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitised images require a correction of the sharpness. this is because the digitalisation process must consist of only minimal differences at one color point. this in turn results in sharp edges becoming blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually need more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">JPEG images often have a camera internal sharpening. images in raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a focus filter while reading the image. if you disable it, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with sharpening keying. you can use the menu entry Corrupt sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should be careful with this because the results do not work very naturally: the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplifies the noise. in general, the most suitable technique to sharpen one image will refocus the tool. you will find further information and a comparison of all the techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the picture a little softly is much easier than it is to sharpen. use the tool to soften with the menu entry Corrupt softness and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unintensely masking is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration you can see here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview help to edit the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should be tested first. an increase in the radius or amount will amplify the effect. if you make the blur mask too strong, noise and the impression of grates will produce sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius indicates how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, you should sharpen images best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. thus, one can define a minimum difference in order to apply for one edge of the filters. thus, areas with a soft alternation between tones are excluded from sharpness and therefore avoid flaw errors in faces, heavens and water surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blur masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image the (2). unsharp mask was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digikam; tool refocus refocused a picture by enhancing the sharpness. it used the copyrighted escape filter algorithm of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to focus a picture & quot; refocusing "; in which it reverses the focus. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blur mask.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular splitting works much better than the Gauss's fold. the Gauss's folding has a very long tail, which leads to the mathematical results also from the swelling pixels, which are far from original source pixel. in most cases, the FIR Vienna Inverse of the Gauss's fold is even very strongly influenced by the remote Pixels.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular fold. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should yield 1 good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artefacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: increasing the noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are only rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0, the image quality is very bad. a good value is 0.03. a high value will further smear the image.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the gauss's sharpness. use this parameter if your blur Gauß 'sch is. this is most often caused by a previously introduced blur filter. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value unequal to zero, you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. increasing the size of the die can produce good results, especially if you select great values for the circle sharpness or the gauge's sharpness. note however that the module is very slow when you select large values for that parameter. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try out all cutting, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before changing the image otherwise. the reason for this is that many operations make changes that are not immediately visible, but later leave uncomfortable artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">When you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, non-sharp masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by discarving a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the blur. for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimum Linear Filter. practically, the result of the FIR Vienna Filters is always at least as good as the blur mask. the FIR Vienna filter is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original opaque color image that needs to be corrected. this picture has been made with an analog camera. the unfocussed result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of sharpening in digital pictures you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The slips control the blur of the area which has been darkened in order to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink tinting allows a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction tool is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust filter settings more finely, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail conservation p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of the details. a small value leads to a uniform smoothing over the image. whereas larger values are mainly homogeneous regions smooth and details sharp. a value of 0.9 should keep details so that no sharpness is subsequently necessary.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional dependency alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions while a value draws near to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film grain or CCD space, a high value will generate wave-like patterns. JPEG's artifacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. set this value to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if very much noise is present, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: specifies how often the algorithm is going to go through. normally, 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle step width since [5, 90]: angle dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if alpha is chosen small, it should also be chosen small. make sure that small angles produce a long runtime. so, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrated step width [0,1, 10]: integrated step width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation: the amount of quality you receive by choosing this option is only minor, but doubles the term. we therefore recommend that you omit it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save as and Load buttons do exactly this. correct any hiring of image errors can be saved to a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image errors is relatively fast at work. however, it may take a long time and load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors can be corrected with small artifacts. the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you see there is a strange black artifact in the foreground that caused by a poor film shift during the trip. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">Die & digikam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts, e.g. from dust or hairs on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mosireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grained noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the details of the subwindow and the Advanced Settings window can remain in the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time the filters are used per pixel and can blur the image. the area indicated by the radius moves over the picture and the color in it is smoothed and therefore smaller mistakes are adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the distance between the filter to the front to determine luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be maintained and the noise or smearing occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, it is not possible to remove all noise or noise peaks. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak hiss or jpeg artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend that you change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the colour tolerance of the image. we recommend that you change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas, which are typically more obscured, but it also greets the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of the phase jitter damping. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of the luminance density. if it is increased, the edges appear smoother if it is too high a smear occur.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used exactly for this purpose. all noise reduction parameters you have set can be stored into the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and corrected with (2). noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. fortunately, the solution to draw the picture a little softly is fortunately much easier than to sharpen a picture. use tool to soften with the menu entry Corrupt softness and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digikam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove gauss's noise, film grain, scratches, compression artifacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or subsequently digitalized pictures.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG's artifacts: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away from it. as a lossy compression algorithm, it produces some compression & quot; artifact quot; - small standards that are to be seen in the uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The Save as and Load buttons do exactly this. any setting of photo restoration can be saved to a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is relatively fast at work. however, it can take a long time and load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Stop.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce like a photo with uniform noise reduction. the module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera to an Ilford (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grain on the faces.</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of photo restoration. this time, textures have been applied to an old color photograph that has been read with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts that were caused by the scanner lighting and the photo paper.</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digikam; tool Hotpixel allows to remove Hotpixel from photos with a CCD camera above, eight have been removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are protected by copyright by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high-quality raw-mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixel "and" quot; bright pixel "; on a photo with a dark image subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Load this file into the Wizard with the button dark image. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these will be highlighted in the preview preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important to capture the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the matching dark image to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview will help you to correct the result within the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixels. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of the adjacent pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn up for the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are approached to compute a bi-square surface (2 dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are moved to compute a bi-cubic surface (2 dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure, applied. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected picture is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digikam; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. under exposed corners, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor area. instead, they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter, which may increase the required closure time in such a way that it is impossible to hold the camera by hand. wide-angle lenses should also be used with center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, otherwise blurring effects are caused by motion.</seg>
<seg id="569">It is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image created without this filter. the tool Vignetting correction applies the transformation with a ceccentric filter to an image. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators you can control the Vignetting correction filter and with three further exposure of the target picture.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light absorption at the point of the largest density of the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which corresponds to an optical filter with aperture setting of 1, or by chance a luminous intensity of 2. increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it by a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Brightness, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignette correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you have to adjust the exposure of the image with these options. the controls only provide positive values, since you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer readjustment of the exposure of the target picture, leave the values for brightness / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation out of & digikam; image processing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetting correction applied to a picture. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected picture. a brightness and contrast correction was also performed with the image using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digikam; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses an copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortions cannot be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree covers the general geometric distortions of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, but flattens on the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of the fourth degree corrects the remote corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two combinations, any geometric distortions can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of distortion 2nd degree. negative values can correct tonal distortion and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of the distortion 4th degree. this value appears more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the image. for most lenses the 'corners parameter has the reverse signature of the parameter in general.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and thus corrects first degrees. negative values increase while positive image resize.</seg>
<seg id="583">Lighten: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog box illustrates the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonn- or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or resizing. best do this correction as the first one. if you re-cut a picture and then perform a tonal correction, the effect would be apparent of the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal helpline. move the mouse cursor into an important place, such as the edge of the sea or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. subsequently, you can correct the tonne / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove these with the trimming tool in the Transforming menu from the image processing or via the Zoom control of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some subjects such as images from the front, frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera by hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonal correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate the infrared feature of the GimpGuru.org web page which is reachable under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfra film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview, you can set two parameters setting film grain and film sensitivity (ISO). add the Add Film Fatal option if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO control changes the amount of film grain and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">As the filter blends color channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos because the colour information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is shown below (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the buttoners.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digikam; filter film grain is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film grain on your pictures. this is known by classic high-speed movies such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the makers mix big silver baskets of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film granulation effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past. the treated image acquires a timeless atmosphere released from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street photographic, grained view especially in your monochrome photos, you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">The regulator can calibrate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although higher values are often needed, to ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and the edited the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digikam; filter oil painting creates the appearance of oil painting. it uses an copyright protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digikam; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. nature pictures and style life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controllers to influence this effect. the upper selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images. flatten the smoothing or, viewed from the other side, the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with (1) and the editing is marked by (2). brush size for this 640 pixel large picture is 1 and smooth 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The ink drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a coal sketch. the lines that define the outlines in the drawing are emphasized. images whose gradients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the charcoal filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digikam; filter engraving shapes your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses an copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. it works especially well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important part of the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monstrous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to set the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the edited image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distortions effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divide the image into cells and let it look like it is seen through blocks of glass.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the wave blocks 1 the picture is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with button ending.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of blurring effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom infinity: blurring the image along star-shaped lines emanating from a center. this simulates the blurring a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurring the image by turning the pixels around a center. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Blurring: blurring the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Blurring: blurring the image through horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: photography from a car or train, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Blurring: blurring the image softly in the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and glossy focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or add a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharpness: blurring the image through random shift of pixels and thus simulates the blurring of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blurring: finds the color basins in the picture and wipes it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: shares the photo in rectangular cells and then recreates it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with button ending.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your image. this makes it natural to your pictures a wet appearance. it uses a by Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. since the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes change the optical effect of droplets on the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use & digikam; image processing can hold a range free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the reggae filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the edited image (2) suggests a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can turn it in the right direction by mirroring or turning. the tools can be found in the Transforming Rotating or Transforming menu.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflating is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached? how can you reinvent or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose to change transformations size in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">Changing the tool to size uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to inflate.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo inflate was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the new size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Keep the aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if very much noise is present, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' Turbulbar effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. enlarging any capture for photo can be saved as a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflating is very fast with what it does, but it can still last very long and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with button ending.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo bubbles by magnifying a small color image onto the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard enlargement to compare.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool for putting together a picture. in order to cut a photo you simply need to create a rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will then see this rectangle while moving the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut off. this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by pulling at the corners of the rectangle. create a new rectangle by simply drag it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button The cutting button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file Save or File save under the File menu to save the newly cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview section, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool Follow the aspect ratio, you can specify orientation as a portrait or landscape format. in portrait format, the greater value of the height and width is always assigned to the width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool Follow the aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeter, inch or any other physical size. for example, you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">At the bottom of the dialog, you can use the Max. relationship button to set the area to cut to the greatest possible, depending on the selected relationship and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool Follow the aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the cutting tool the next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation. the modified image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data reflect the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The setup help settings allow you to blend helds so that you can better put your images together. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious Triangles are based on the principle of similarity. like the third elbows, harmonious triangles are a way to divide a rectangle into a similar harmonious triangles at the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden centre: the golden centre is a division that refers to various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it has been used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden center. a composition which follows this rule is considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides liquid help lines when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spirale will bring you closer to your goal to achieve good results for your photos. in comparison with the third-hand gel, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the gaze of the observer along the line of the spiral and creates in this way a symmetric visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">A second rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. there should be something that directs the eye to the center of the composition.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles also derive from the golden spiral discussed above. their vertices are the middle points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not equalateral triangles. diagonal to these lines can make a static object more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame, create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your focus at one of the intersection points and other visual information in triangles.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the Color button you can set the color of the help lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the guides can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines of your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you do a photo, then it happens easy that you do not hold the camera vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are rotated around an angle. you can do this with & digikam; image processing and the tool free rotation. select Transform Free Rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slider angle. the values on this slide are specified in degrees. with the Preferences button you can set the slide again to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the free rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse cursor to position the two lines. after moving it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix this is to use the Transforming cutting from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the picture is the Automatically cut function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the image a bit after the turn. however, note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectival transformations are performed by a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically calculated. on the right side of the dialog, you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty spaces created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty spaces created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Upper left corner: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Right above: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Corner left below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Right below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image is greased a little. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adaptations generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective, you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the image with transformations from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool is used to move a part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. a horizontal line, for example, will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left. this is not rotation, the image is distorted.</seg>
<seg id="679">Select your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. you can rotate horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you press presets, the angle will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target picture will be displayed on the right of the preview section.</seg>
<seg id="680">For your help, a vertical and a horizontal line is displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the scaling, the picture gets a little blurred. for a single scaling, this effect is mostly negligible, but two circuits cause twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the scaling the picture has unsightly triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with transformations of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digikam; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries are compiled. in most distributions, you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependency on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digikam; displays only files in formats to those who know. this happens on the basis of the file extension and a comparison of those with a pre-defined list. if the extension is listed in the list, & digikam; the file in the image processing is displayed. you can edit this list of file extensions that & digikam; see the Configuration section for more information.</seg>
<seg id="686">Virtually all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you even to select the format to be used. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digikam; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression techniques to digital images. redundant information is reduced in order to store image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general, there are better, smoother results than JPEG with the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also save lossless when specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw image format, you can read Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English. you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from & digikam; convert. in the Configuration section you will find further information about the use of modules with & digikam.</seg>

<seg id="701">All image processing tools such as sharpening, soft marks, noise suppression, refocus, unmasking, & etc;. use a uniform dialog box that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image.</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar displays the status of the filter to the current image. to the left of it, five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area. these modes are:</seg>

<seg id="704">Horizontal parts without duplicate. the upper part shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview range.</seg>
<seg id="705">The left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter.</seg>

<seg id="725">& graphicviewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; -graphviz; programs are free layout programs. graphs are used in science, in particular in computer science. so far there was no modern & GUI; program to visualize graphs. the programs, which & graphviz; includes, are outdated according to the program author & X11; - or & tcltk; programs with only a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kgraphical viewer; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& calviz; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; -graph.Graphic; programs are free layout programs. & kGraphic; displays graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & Posters; and & konqueror; (so that a change in graphene in & kate, recomputes the graph and displays it in & kgraphical viewer;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to make the graph in & kate; to open or to open the graphene in & kgraphical viewer; in a & Posters; component</seg>
<seg id="730">Load large graphs (currently there are problems from about 1000 knots and one hack to show more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further required software: & kdviewer; is a & kde; program which presupposes the & graphviz; tool & dot; for displaying the graphs. required in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graph, each in its own sub-window. initially, if you start & capitalize without an argument, the main window is empty as shown in the bottom screenshot. in this case, the toolbar contains only the icon file and the (empty) list Recently opened files. click the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After selecting one or more & dot; -files, the main window looks like in the bottom screenshot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is larger than the canvas. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & Alt; -key);</seg>
<seg id="736">The zooming is limited in both directions by a factor of 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the file has just been changed from another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph should be reloaded or whether you want to ignore the change. & kGraphic; can also remember your decision, so that later it will proceed as well. if you want to change your decision later, you can use the Settings kgraphical viewer; see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">When you open a graph node outside a current & kgraphical viewer; eg, & eg; in the file browser or at the command line, you have the choice whether you want to open a new graphical viewer; or to display the graphs to be loaded in a sub-window of the current instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but also change it with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">When you start the program, you can re-open all graphs of your last session. again, you can save your choice either as well as change it later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how to split the graph to multiple pages. the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen.</seg>
<seg id="743">When you use several pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph, which come to a page, should be adjusted to this page. in doing so, the aspect ratio is ignored. if you keep the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled by the respective sections of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Preview with a graphene divided on several pages without header and with a different font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Renewal Load page gives the option to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive, & eg; from another program. you can specify a default behavior (automatically reload or ignore the changes) or ask the program every time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The Open page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of & clickviewer; specify when a graph is opened outside of a running session. you can specify a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a subwindow of the already running session) or determine that each time is asked.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session management page gives you the option to specify the start behavior of & clickviewer; you can specify a default behavior (open or not open the files of the last session) or decide to be asked at every start.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which usually appears with a click in the main window with the & RMBs; opens up further possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can select from different & graphviz; -layout algorithms. the entries described on the website of & graphviz are:</seg>
<seg id="750">& dot; algorithm, the standard for directional graphs. it produces hierarchical or layered displays of directional graphs. the algorithm places the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as little edge overlaps as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for underivative graphs. it produces images according to the spring model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is equivalent to statistical multidimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm creates a bouncing spring model for unerived graphs. it uses the Frutiger's pure gold heuristics, and includes a multi-lattice for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm orders the nodes in a circle, according to the description of Six und Tolli, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for specific diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command that is then executed by a shell. the command should display the graph file as a parameter, and output the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command, you can give & eg; the & graphviz; -algorithms change the graph before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Determines the type of graph (directed or executed) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type (dot; for directional, & neato; for derivative graphs).</seg>
<seg id="756">If this setting is enabled, the overview will be displayed if necessary. otherwise it will not be shown and the positioning menu is inactive.</seg>

<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and save new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan images: uses the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner supported by the sane project or another source such as Video Streams. to make this work you have to have Kooka and Sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the menu entry Images a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer. select here the source from which you want to fetch the image. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window will appear by replacing the default ducthe default values to select your image accordingly. see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image with the Scan button. the estimated file size will be displayed in the right, bottom corner.</seg>
<seg id="777">Be sure that the window will be displayed completely, otherwise some settings may not be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="778">After you have pressed the button scanning you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the image file options appears. please remember that the type BMP does not compress and therefore creates very large files. you also need to select the folder & # 160; select or create the image to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="779">You can create screenshots after you have selected the screen shot in the Importive- &gt; screenshot menu. a window appears in which you can set the different screen photomodi:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select the complete Desktop to read a single window under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="781">If All its own program windows are selected, the calling program will disappear so that you can see other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, you will read the currently visible work place. if you have selected the entire work surface you will only read the window under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay determines how long screen shot is waiting before it starts. if you need to switch to other working surfaces, you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there.</seg>
<seg id="783">After the screenshot has been created, the dialog box options dialog appears with the options described above.</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management on the Internet. Flickr makes it possible to send your photos to people who are important. you can show your favorite photos of the world showing photos of your camera and show your photos safe and private to your friends and family all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The Flickr module can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time, you are led through the process of generating a token. this is used for your authentication. so, it is virtually your ID to Flickr. a browser is started so you can register with Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After successful registration, the module can send photos to Flickr's website. you will be presented the following page after a successful registration.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after you have pressed Yes, you get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the exporting module is started to Flickr for the second time, you will be greeted with the following dialog which displays the current access permissions that the module displays. for uploading, you will need write permissions. the module currently does not support any other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button Photos should be pressed once you have set all the other options. with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. if you press on the Ok button, start uploading the photos to Flickr Server.</seg>
<seg id="803">The keywords field can be filled with a comma-delimited list of words. these are added to the image as keywords during upload.</seg>
<seg id="804">The Public, Friends and Familly options allow you to set access permissions to your images. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you change the option Modify the size of the photos before uploading, the photos will be changed in size before uploading. the size is taken from the value registered at maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images. the size is modified so that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>
<seg id="807">The KIPI module gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server</seg>
<seg id="808">The KIPI module gallery export has no documentation right now. if you are interested in writing this please contact the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographic localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographic data are stored in the EXIF data of the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI geographical localization module provides tools to localize images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and width are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographical data, you need a GPS track as an XML file in gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsapi.dll may download and convert data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Picture Geographical location Korrelator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. the top-looking dialog appears then. to create a possible correlation over time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed which indicates the coordinates in red. GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera direction must be converted with the GMT. this can be done with the time zone. set your camera time here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for maximum time variance indicates the upper deviation for the GPS time and camera direction. if the deviation is below, the data will be merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have trace data from a location for pictures you can manually edit the gpx file and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolating and difference in minutes can be used if you have no suitable data. if you know that in reality there is a location in a big time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlating to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same place. since the dialog is the coordinates of one call to the next, you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the displayed map. select the appropriate region and enlarge it. choose this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the map can be changed between map mode, satellite photo and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the images. here is a small script that uses the exifttool to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI Module picture gallery is a tool for exporting a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums which are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded by UTF-8 to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The menu has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted. the Rider selection allows you to select all the albums which are to be exported to HTML. you only need to select these albums. the three buttons on the right hand side allows you to quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the Albenvorschau and the text appearing in the header of the HTML page will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab Appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this tab is largely self explanatory. the option For each picture one page creates a gallery in which each picture also gets its own page. if you then click on a picture, a new page is opened in which the image is displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your standard picture viewer, & eg; Kuickshow</seg>
<seg id="825">The tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all your associated images. select a folder where you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLExport which contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth you can change the default color depth. of course, it also influences the file size. all other settings are self explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The Rider thumbnail allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for preview images, which are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window tells the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">When the module has created the pages, the window will not be automatically closed. you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors have occurred during production. the web browser is automatically launched at the end to preview the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI picture viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rotations, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and folders. it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its features.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is displayed in full screen mode by default. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of the loss-free storage is that the file size increases as there is no compression of the color information. this can be found e.g. in the PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI digital camera client is a tool for you to connect your computer to a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing these, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the kde-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the Import function of the metadata module you can copy data from one image to another. to do so, select the image you want to copy in the main program and then open the Import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the image, so the image to which you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work for all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not write into any destination format. JPEG is supported when writing. please look at exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodiver module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodiver module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the Mjpegtools and ImageMagick packages. you can also add a basic image transition between the individual images. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV of the slide.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can select a background color for the slide show. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You first need to select the images to be packed into the MPEG Diashau. after that you can create the module via Extras MPEG Diashau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you have selected are then listed among image files in the Portfolio, where you can also change the images or contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to replay the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV Standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is pre-set and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should specify the time in seconds a picture is displayed. the speed of the image transition is specified below. a low value creates very sudden, a high, very smooth image changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in case of doubt, you should leave it black. the name and path of the generated file can be set under the name of the mpeg output file.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adapted all settings to your preferences, you can start the creation of the movie with the encoding button. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now quickly or in all rest enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slide while you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a critic appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can customize the paths to the Mjpegtools and ImageMagick packages using the Settings button on the right.</seg>
<seg id="852">The Print Assistant lets you print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp. this is, for example, useful for you to improve or print directly with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import and convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw of Dave Coffin. an original quote from him is: do not expect from dcraw that it produces the same results as the software from your camera creator. sometimes you get with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file that you want to convert and start the module. the Raw image converter window then appears in the mode for a single image. with the Preview button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides if the camera settings are to be used for white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-color RGBG conversion can be selected for you to use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG-switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it.</seg>
<seg id="859">Tagged Image Format, TIFF, keeps all the information of your image and uses lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you plan to process your images frequently or otherwise use them later, you should not choose the JPEG format, since it allows only a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose to save JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is included in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start the conversion with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch converting mode allows you to convert different images at once. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, they have the possibility to overwrite existing file automatically. this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar indicates how far the conversion has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to recompress all images in one album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images on an album. you can set the prefix, the start number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce or enlarge the image. to do this, four types of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 dot.): normal size change in one dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio remains unchanged. for example, you can use this option to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: no proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Print preparation: prepares the image for the photo printing. the user can set the print resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target picture, including background size, edge size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your favorite email program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the image window will be displayed with the images you have selected. by clicking the Images button, you can add more images using a file selection dialog. for the last selected image, a preview is displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop images to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">The images will be removed from the list of images to be sent with the button.</seg>
<seg id="876">After selecting all the images, press OK to open the new message window of your e-mail client. you only need to add the addresses and the subject here. the pictures you have selected are already attached as attachments.</seg>
<seg id="877">Make sure not to send too many pictures at once. most email accounts have limitations for the size of the sending emails. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and used every time you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you will need to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you must first install the Gmail agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in an attached file, the comments to the images are added to a text file and the mail is attached.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. therefore, you should use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG images in JPEG format and the original images are in JPEG format, then the original EXIF data will be added to the images you want to send.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be automatically closed so you can view the status messages, searching for errors. your E-mail program will be started automatically at the end. you can close this window with the button Close.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Slideshow a window with questions like you would like to show your slide show appears. you can choose between the albums selected by you and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL-Transitions option in the presentation mode selects very elegant image transitions by means of OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The Display option flag makes sure that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner of the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop flag makes it possible to display the presentation in an infinite loop. you can then manually cancel it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option to randomly select images makes sure that the images are displayed in a random order. so it is not used the order of the pictures in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The distance between the images can be set between the images. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect.</seg>
<seg id="891">There are over a dozen transition effects between which you can select. randomly, each transition between the images selects another effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During slide show you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop and restart the presentation, jump to the previous one and stop the slide.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the left lower edge of the screen you can see the current filename, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module Time & Date has no documentation right now. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the work surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module uses the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as a background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">As soon as you have your pictures and videos with annotations, you can with & kphotoalbum; browse them, see picture. how you can see through a comparison with the picture are now available in each group, so in people, places and in group keywords.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window, you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your pictures and videos with annotations. in addition, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current preview images.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse on the entry people the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">When you select another person, only the images are shown on which both persons can be seen. through this selection method you can limit the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few individual images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the people, places, and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view the images of your sphere of activity.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture every person has the same symbol before their name. however, you can use & kphotoalbum; however, for each person you can save your own thumbnail, which of course also applies to places, keywords and other categories you have defined yourself. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the name, select the button located on the right side of the toolbar. in the pop-up context menu, you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can view e.g. symbols with images of individuals and at the same time a list of keywords (if you do not have suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you need to specify which image to display for each individual person. to do this, you will need to view the image acquisition window (in more detail) and select the image for the respective person in the context menu. here you can adjust the image for the respective person. in the selection window, you can adjust the magnification factor according to your wishes and choose which part of the image should be displayed or cut.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you visit the Search item in the main window, a dialog will show you which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the label or description, the captions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to be searched; the date can be either a part of the total date, i.e. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two dates, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window, you can browse all the images by certain names as you can see in the picture. here, the pictures where Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & photoalbum; if you don't like to read handbooks, but rather want to try out functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and watch the quick entry, the screenshots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and in the first dialogue, select the demo if you start & photoalbum; start for the first time, or select from the menu help menu entry kphotoalbum; -Demo. as a result, some sample images will be loaded and you can try out the functions of & photoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & photoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar can be seen here:. as the name suggests, this bar displays date statistics on the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can show you several different time units. each bar then displays another unit. you can switch between classes years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 minutes sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be interactively used in the following ways: you can change the displayed items preview view from the database (if you select a date, the first image of that date will be displayed in the preview) and the timeline always displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures, if you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a range of timeline by holding down the mouse button and drawing the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time data. if you select an area, only images of that period will be displayed in the preview view. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you two options available to create HTML pages with your pictures. one is in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other is available as a module (see). in the following part of the user manual, the in & kphotoalbum is described; integrated version described which you can create via the menu file HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages, you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and destination. in the following, each area is described more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the title and a description that will later contain the HTML file. on kphotoalbum, HTML-example pages you will see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & kphotoalbum; -Export file should be created which can be seen on the overview page.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages. by doing so you can avoid that information is displayed to the viewer without description. for example, that all images are from a party. note that & kphotoalbum; currently all images are exported. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section, you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why it is not specifically dealt with.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images. this means that those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 do not have to download any images that have a resolution of 1600x1200 for example.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewers of your page can change the resolution at any time you have set. so you can browse your images with low resolution, leading to a lower transfer time. if you want to get a larger image larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, you specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best select a base folder for all your HTML files and create a new subfolder for each successive set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored. this folder is saved and automatically added at the next time. this allows you to select the location for all future images. here you can either select a folder or a log supported by KDE, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">Once you have created your images, you can check if they are all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser will start after the pages have been created. otherwise, the URL you set here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you have to manually copy them there. for the import function, see, properly works you need to specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings that I have just described have moved to base folders and URLs. a subfolder is created in these settings, whose name you specify in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or anywhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; coming together, you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the images. however, if you have spent a lot of time applying the image information, persons on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you must with & kphotoalbum; this work will not do again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. you can import others to your database. the image properties are imported and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in the fact whether the images themselves are stored with the file or whether the file is only a shortcut to images. the advantage of storing all images in the file is that you have all the images together and that you can transmit this file as independent. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can either export a .kim file directly from the File menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file looks for the images in two ways. first, it searches the images that are located in the .kim file's folder. if the corresponding images are not found, the images of the URL you have provided when creating the HTML files will be searched. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following describes the dialog for exporting images that you can invoke from the File menu... menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">With option Manual close to the .kim file, you have to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option Automatically copied to the .kim file copy & photoalbum; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most images have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worth compressing the files. if you want to do so, simply select the Export File option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size. if you send images to your friends, you may not want to send the images in full size because the .kim file would otherwise be very large. for example, you can limit the size by saying that each image should be maximum 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you import a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File menu... select, & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in description.</seg>
<seg id="943">The import assistant consists of four steps. first you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folders the import pictures should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category people of the file to be imported (if you are a domain) while this category is in your database. therefore, you will be asked in the third dialog box, which categories the file to import should be imported and which categories they correspond to your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. for an example, see the image.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and view images: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump within different picture groups & mdash; for example, if you look at pictures of your holiday in Italy and discover a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will go through the various steps of (1) setting the information about your images, via (2) searching and viewing, up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum has been started as a program to manage your images. however, it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual is talked about pictures, but often this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; saves all of its information in the file index.xml in the topmost folder of your images. this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a disk or revisions in CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; note the folder in which your images are stored and will automatically re-use it in future starts. if you want to read another database in & kphotoalbum; so start a different folder tree with pictures, you can & kphotoalbum; with the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / Pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry Settings kphotoalbum; set up... you can access a window that allows you to change the settings of & photoalbum; in the following section of the user manual, the various settings options are explained to you.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols that allow you to preview and view options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which can be accessed by pressing a button on the F1 key and clicking on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can set different properties for each image, e.g. persons, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups, such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog used to process existing groups. for each existing group, you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories have already been mentioned. in the Options dialog, you can set up complete members groups, e.g. all members of a group at a time in a group, rather than all groups of a mediate as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the list above you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window there is a list with the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; shares its module system with other graphics applications, such as digitising and GwenView. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image Plug-in Interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be accessed via the modules menu. the modules can and are not described in this manual since they are not part of & kphotoalbum; however, most modules have a help page, which you can access via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used by several applications together, it may be that the modules were tested with & kphotoalbum; only very little tested. therefore, you should always test new modules with the demo database before you use them on your own images The & kphotoalbum; demo database can be accessed either via the command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu.</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that the modules over KIPI share in common are very different, making it possible that some modules with & kphotoalbum are not working. this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between photoalbum and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications make their pictures in albums: an album is simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this type of order is not supported, it simulates order for some modules to make use of the functions with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">It simulates & photoalbum; the current album that simply fits the current view, so all the pictures that show you the picture preview at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album & kphotoalbum, the modules also have to pass a list of albums. here is a photoalbum, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s Browser shows the contents of a category, e.g. all persons, each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you specified in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you are using the category people, & kphotoalbum, so do so, so if you would have selected people to view it and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Because some modules with & kphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. to do this, launch the Settings dialog and select the modules to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start your photoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used to from any other KDE application, you will see a menu and toolbar at the top. at the bottom of the toolbar you will see the window with which you can browse your image database.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to include any picture with annotations. this includes information about the persons depicted in the picture, where the picture was taken etc. you can set each image either individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time. if for example, on all pictures Jesper is pictured and all pictures taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want, you can see these notes if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view, you can see three lists with a text box by selecting people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; because you will always use them when you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on moving images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and on all 50 images the same 5-10 persons are depicted, you can, through that the used names are moved up, find people faster and assign them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click on the title for sort by date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected annotations for each image individually, you may want to edit all the selected pictures and add these pictures with annotations. in this case, simply click on the front and back buttons below the preview of the picture on the right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have taken several images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and to use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the USA. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles are California.</seg>
<seg id="977">In the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as an overboard. to show you that it is a subgroup, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the Comment dialog context menu it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new subcategory. in addition, you can also drag an entry to a category and drop it to make it a sub-category of this entry. attention, this presupposes that you just sort your categories alphabetically.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bar that form the top edge of the frame. you can also make your own window from a frame by dragging it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs, that you are satisfied with the settings, click the Options... button, which offers among other things the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also fade out a frame completely. if you want to see this window again later, use the Options button... and then hide / hide windows. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select View imagery in your browser, you will get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected pictures, or all images in case you do not have a filter. an example for this is shown here. you can configure the thumbnail size by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image will be set as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this will be shown in the picture viewer. if you have not opened a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the preview preview. simply select the respective images you want to delete and press either the Remove button or select Edit Selection from the Edit menu. now the window that you can see in the picture will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use with & kphotoalbum; namely images also without having you saved on the hard drive. of course you need to have the pictures stored anywhere so that & kphotoalbum; you can view the view from & photoalbum; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images in which the upper right corner is truncated are not stored on the hard disk. however, for the images 5-9, the thumbnails are present so that & kphotoalbum. you can also view these images with the picture viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see, this feature requires you to copy and copy files from the folders and copy them back again. so if you want to avoid annoyance, like messing up your images, please buy a larger hard drive to save all the images.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the Pictures menu, you will find a submenu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the images in such a way that at the end those who want to make others inaccessible and click Update Lock in the Privacy menu. alternatively, you can also control all the images that your little sister may see, and lock the menu entry Anything out of the current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">This allows you to decide which images should be hidden in the case of the case. if you now give your little sister to your laptop, simply select the menu entry Add images, so that all the images you have locked will be hidden.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select password in the Privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">On the one hand, all images on the hard disk and on the other hand anybody who can access the file index.xml can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection serves only to deny the view of private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you spend all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and describe hours over hours with it is of course that you want to look at them sometime. for this reason, & kphotoalbum; via an image _ and video viewer. you can start from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. of course it shows the picture, but additional all the information you have to enter about the image, such as who is on the picture, when and where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the info box on the top part of the image you want to see, you can simply drag it with the mouse and drop somewhere else. you can also configure what information is displayed and if any information is to be displayed. all of these options are available right click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">If you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you would have selected people from your browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have multiple images loaded in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image up and down. you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and end. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slide show. & kphotoalbum; then loads a new image after a few seconds. how often a new image can load can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer from & photoalbum; to be able to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the entire space on the screen. simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer, you can simply drag a rectangle into the image. with the mouse button you can simply zoom in a rectangle. with the minus button you can zoom out again The Plus button zooms in the middle of the image. shows how a zoom angle is selected and shows the outcome of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the item button you can reset your zoom so that the image is not zoomed. with the "" "" Sync "" "" button sets the zooms, so that each pixel matches a pixel of the image. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work in videos show that they are in and out with the plus and negative button.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the turning functions from the context menu, you can rotate the image. this does not work for videos. you can make notes on the current image with the menu item comments from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">When you look at pictures it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to place on the picture. in the moment you can look at it and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter these names.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you look one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to paint pictures with features while you look at them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter. in this you see a picture where the characteristics A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">As soon as you have features placed on your images, these are available in your browser. so if you have all the images you edit, print or whatever you have selected, simply add any notes. this is described in. after that you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view. if you display categories in the special preview view then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the character for the feature after the image was selected. this can be seen here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case, you will be allowed to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The mixture is not saved with the image, but in the database. in this way you can undo your gems later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to enable the painting mode of & kphotoalbum; switch on the painting from the context menu. to finish the painting, simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovremoer; you need to use the program & Povray; not completely master, but the documentation to & Povray; should you absolutely have read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wire model views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the subobject of an already selected object, since all sub-objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position on which you want to insert the object and either click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following pop-up menu is displayed for you to choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">With deleting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button you can remove selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have modified properties, click Apply to take these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message with error description will be displayed. then you can correct the input errors and click Apply again or discard the changes with Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1019">When you enter the path to & Povray; -user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press thumbnail in the property view and a small sample of the scene will be rendered with the selected texture. as default, the whole texture is rendered, even if you want to render only a part of the texture (for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), tick it locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can move these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse inside the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a Visibility level as a wire model. you can indicate this value relative to the level of visibility of the parent object or as absolute value. objects are displayed only when they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility level chosen in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">The object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window layout or if you need a different arrangement, you can set it as you like. you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window over or under a view, drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then displays the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the starter to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other, drag the beginner in the middle of another view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the tabs at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement is floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from anchorage, drag the starter on the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing upwards in the fascia strip.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the fascia strip. to prevent closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can add additional views to the main window. in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor it anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can be saved with View Window Order... save. it displays a dialog where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you created a scene, you can render it. & kpovremoer; used & Povray; 3.1g to render, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovremoer; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click the Rendern sign The Rendering icon in the toolbar or select the Scenes menu item.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode meets the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and the quality of the rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of render modes, from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or in the View Render Modi... menu, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the box size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you only want to render a small area of the image, select the check box below and enter the image section for rendering to the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the quality combination field, you can select the properties that are used & Povray; this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuse retro-reflective illumination. a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User's Guide to & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If an image is rendered with only one beam each pixel, different errors can occur. these images often have a Moiré pattern or tier effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not shown when they are smaller than one pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. generally, images with this feature look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you switch on anti-aliasing, calculates and combines & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. the standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling is the adjacent pixel. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively, because each pixel is continuously separated and adapted because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method, POV-Ray will follow a beam of each pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the specified threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference then is:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are further tracked and tested for further subdivision.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the ray process called Jittering. if you turn on Jittering, modify & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; which calculates diffuse light reflection. it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can specify whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the associated rays have not hit any object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly finished, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; scene file, select Import menu entry... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supported & kpovremoer; not yet the full command of & Povray; when importing error messages or warnings, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source text in & kpovremoer; want to import this source text between the two particular comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds the source code of the object to the opened text file in the editor. to import objects to the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">Copying and pasting in & kpovremoer; and in your editor you can insert source code for & Povray; also.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovremoer; a scene changes. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on Help in the property view, open & kpovremoer; the & Povray; user documentation to the displayed object. insert here the path to your top and the version. supports versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example height field data) in the paths to the & Povray; -libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you also need to add the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used to display the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used to display the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects such as the sphere you can set the level of detail separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">When you tick high detailed fidelity for advanced projections, all wire model views are further subdivided if the camera uses an extended projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and vertical projections. this feature gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time for rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you flag a wall, a wall is rendered behind the objects. the wall is represented in a checkerboard pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the floor, a floor below the objects will be rendered. the floor is represented in a checkerboard pattern of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick edge smoothing, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold value. more precise information on the parameters can be found in the Render-Modi section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders. in the window instructions section, explains how to create and save window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The drop down selector standard window arrangement: displays all existing window orders. & kpovremoer; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders. a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and select a selected order with the Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Every window ordering is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement. you can add new views with the Add button and delete selected views with the Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">With new column, you create a new column on the right side of the existing windows, with unts you anchor the window under the existing window, with card card you will get a card map view together with the previous view and floating anchoring the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just & Povray; and & kpovremoer; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this tutorial, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, very popular among beginners: a sphere on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules can be applied for rendering, as a result you get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your entire scene is in the dark and you will only get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything correctly, see the first start of & kpovremover; the following pre-set window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and symbols of the toolbar. please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols frequently so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">To follow this guide, first you need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the Edit menu item. you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create. in particular, you notice that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the various parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation to & Povray; see further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera. simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you use the Apply button or the Enter key, the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the camera's point of view.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. you could, for example, insert a quad (insert Endress Body quader) and adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a complicated method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovremover; offers actually a simpler way. you can use an infinite layer as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply button or enter the Enter. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now also shows the plane, though at the moment only as a finite finite plane. when you render the scene, the plane stretches to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look carefully at the object tree, you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor when you click on the symbol + in front of the object. in this case, you will only see the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the ground to the exercise one unit below the horizontal line, just to get to know some of these parameters. choose shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but at the moment choose something simple.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog opens where you can select how to insert the object. please select first subproperty. the pigment will then be displayed in the object tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = floor pigment), click the thumbnail button to see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the pigments preview only shows a matte black material because you have to enter settings for the pigment again. therefore, always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on thumbnail.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see a color on the header and the ball in the preview, just click the Apply button and then enter the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the symbol, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">In the color list you need to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. then edit this entry twice (you can also do this more frequently, but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, select monochrome each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should be done simply because you should have understood the basic working method of & kpovremover; the ball can be created just as easily as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In view of the object properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (do not forget to press the Enter key or the Apply button), so the ball has contact with the floor. otherwise, the ball would float above the ground as you have shifted the floor by one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, rendering now results in a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface appears like a matte black material. in the following step, put a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign it to a material. as on the ground, give the sphere a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select first subobject and change the name for example in sphere pigment. click on sphere pigment, then select Unicoloured and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screenshots and click Apply or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings of shine effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome-plated surfaces even when metallic: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities are available to you & kpovremoer; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracing is a render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you cycle a scene, the renderer shoots hypothetical beams from the viewer's perspective (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the render counts how this ray is reflected and broken by the objects, the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog effect.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source, you see nothing, the picture is just black. obviously, every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog, you can select a file that you have previously created with & kpovremoer;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file is inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you will need to enter a name and a disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Recovers the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last saved version are discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">You can only select this menu entry if you do not have any saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last command. this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit Refresh.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or override an existing order.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovremover; here you can change the look, the shortcut and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcut. with this option you can change preset short commands for & kpovremover; modify commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up toolbars. with this option you can add and remove toolboxes for & kpovremover; add and remove commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump map is a way to simulate rugged surfaces without having to model every diffraction on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for both a bump map and a texture mapping.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic elements are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are made of dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture mapping is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis by applying an image file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files that can be displayed by clicking on the & LMBs; or the return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can specify whether each image should be displayed in a separate window, or if all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file type, type the first character of the file name in the browser window. then, a small input field appears in the right lower corner. if a matching filename is found, the file will be highlighted.</seg>

Select.</seg>
<seg id="1182">You may set up existing multimedia buttons to work as & Amarok; short commands work. this will make your keyboard to & Amarok; control center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general functions that are usually found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP features of collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlist browser and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports command line options from Qt and & kde; additionally, Amarok has some command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependency. please check in your script, if all required modules are present and use kdialog so that the user knows why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Require require 'Corundum' Rescue LoadError error = 'Corundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script.' 'kdialog --sorry' # {error} 'exit end</seg>
<seg id="1187">In scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the base for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, you can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command; any KDE installation should be included.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow executing external programs and commands. for this purpose exec () is usually used. in this way dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here's an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; send notifications to all running scripts. for this reason, strings are written to the standard input of the script. for this reason, scripts should continuously monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script can also ignore the events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Weightens the script to display the setup dialog. to save and load the setup data, each script must take care of itself. if a script is started, Amarok puts the working folder on the folder where all the data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signalizes that a new piece is alluded. the script now could & zb; with DCOP-Functions, further information about the new piece can be retrieved (for example the metadata or the piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume Change newVolume signalizes a change in volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle paths includes the path to the selected files of the playlist, when a user-defined menu entry has been clicked. submenu and itemTitle are also passed to allow the script to identify the clicked entry. to remove an entry, you can use dcop Amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (Submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; it ends, or when the user stops a script, it sends Amarok; the SIGTERM signal to the script. this signal should be processed to do e.g. cleaning tasks. this includes, for example, storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install script packages that the user & eg downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically standard Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2).</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the caption of amaroscript. for this reason, you should name your script packages correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file permissions:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is finished, you can add it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki scripts page of & Amarok. for your entry on kde-apps you should use the category Amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok; you can simply drag music into the playlist, rather than having to work through endless menus. maybe you just search for a certain title of thousands in your collection. with & Amarok; 's collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Maybe you already have some playlists, but can never decide which you want to listen to? then the playlist browser is the right thing for you. and if the decision is still difficult, the dynamic mode and smart playlists will automatically select the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers ifp and many generic USB devices. besides, many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose to listen to your music. Amarok is intelligent, sexy and chic - just the right thing to rediscover your music!</seg>
<seg id="1204">Usually you have to enter the following in the basic folder of the Amarok Sources to compile and install Amarok:</seg>
<seg id="1205">Since & Amarok, autoconf and autoconf, you should not have trouble with compiling. if you encounter problems, please report them in the & kde; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& Amarok; like most applications, has some options to enable or disable the compile time point with the configure script. this is a list of available options.</seg>
<seg id="1207">For some of the compile options certain dependencies must be fulfilled so that they can be used. for details, see the system requirements section.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Activates Debugging Symbols. you have the choice between yes, no and full. if you want to help in the development of & Amarok; you should use full.</seg>
<seg id="1209">& Amarok; it can be set up without difficulty using the setup dialog. the setup dialog has several flashcards to set up the various functions of & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1210">If the option is switched off, only the playlist window is displayed.</seg>

<seg id="1214">External browser: lets select which browser of & Amarok should be started when a browser is needed.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Use other browsers: here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1216">Save playlists to exit, stores the current playlist automatically when you exit & Amarok;. enable this option if you don't want to lose the current playlist when you exit.</seg>
<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually saved playlists: when you enable this setting, & Amarok; relative paths to music files, starting from the location of the playlist, will be used. otherwise, the absolute position of the music files is stored.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Keep the current piece visible when changing parts, so that the playlist window will roll up / down to keep the current piece in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">Changing the context browser automatically shows the context browser as soon as the next piece is played.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section you can customize the look & Amarok; the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the font section, you can select the use of different fonts in & Amarok. by marking your own fonts use the otherwise gray outlined section. you can select fonts for the following area: playlists window, player windows and context browser. click Select..., so you can select a desired font from the drop-down dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1222">With the Selection color scheme you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme. to do so, use the color selection activated, for foreground and background color.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Playback at start means that & Amarok; after program start playback automatically continues with the piece in the place with which it was stopped at the last stop.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Set up the on-screen display panel allows you to turn on the OSD. if on-screen display is attached, a preview of the OSD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click Select... to select the desired font for the OSD from the dialog. the check box shadows causes the text to be shaded in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Using your own colors gives you the option to adjust the OSD colours for writing and background. a click on the color areas will open the dialog for color selection. if your own colors are not enabled, the default colors will be used; colors will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The Display Text input field displays the text displayed in the OSD. by entering space holders, the OSD can be adapted to your own needs. below you will find a list of available placeholders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The Display option is intended for Xinerama users, so you can specify on which screen a multiple monitor environment should appear on the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The card-card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop-down box. some drivers still activate other settings in this flashcard.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The card bundle collection is used to set up all settings for your collection. this includes the folder and type of database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folder, the & Amarok, to search for music files. to include a folder in the collection, select the check box next to its name. this section also contains check boxes for setting how to process with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Browse recursively: this causes & Amarok to browse both the selected and their subfolders for music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitoring changes: allows & Amarok to monitor the selected folders for changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). in addition, an incremental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import Playlists: causes & Amarok to add all found playlists to your collection folders (.pl- and .m3u files) to your collection. the playlists added automatically appear later in the playlist browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The collection database is used to select a database for the collection. the drop down selector driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further setup is required in the MySql subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="1236">The MySql device section is used to set up the database for & Amarok; on calculator: will enter the computer on which the MySql database is located. after that the network port is entered, under which the database is reachable. name: is the database name to which the connection is established.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Use Username: and Password: to enter the data required for connection to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1238">The last.fm file card provides support for last.fm. & Amarok; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last.fm server and if necessary create music recommendations regarding the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1239">Here you enter your username and password for your Last.fm profile. if you don't have a profile, you can register one on the last.fm website.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Send played pieces and so update the profile: this setting makes it possible & Amarok to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last.fm profile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">Retrieve similar interpreters: after activating this setting, & Amarok; a list with similar interpreters to the played piece. note: you do not need a last.fm profile to use this function.</seg>
<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (like & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok needed only the package kdelibs and no other KDE packages. you need to have kdelibs installed (including the included programs, because & Amarok; needed some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts).</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD require that your window manager stick to the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. so Gnome will work, but fluxbox will cause difficulties, for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt, because these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">You can locate the file by browsing in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this bug to the Taglib developer under bug.kde.org and also append the broken file that caused the crash.</seg>
<seg id="1246">It is mostly due to the fact that taglib crashes when reading the meta-information from this file. please report this error to the Taglib developer under bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for it in & Amarok; is a little more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all of & Amarok; used libraries with the same compiler version have been compiled. if, for example, compiles with GCC 3.4, Tag Lib but with GCC 3.3.X, this leads to crashes when editing the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd, then disable automatic switch off if inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least do not use a value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by e-mail (the e-mail will automatically open in case of a crash). if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error is guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 into the meta-information, but do not mark them as Unicode. the following Perl script resolves the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl "" The file $ARGV [0] does not exist "unless -f $ARGV [0]; use MP3:: mplib; my $mp3 = MP3:: Mplib; my $mp3 = MP3:: Mplib; my $MP3- &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>

<seg id="1255">If you get this error: symbol lookup error: symbol lookup error: symbol lookup error: undefined symbol: _ ZN11KsystemTray9setPixmapERK7Qpixmap, then check if Amarok uses the correct Qt library.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this bug, you may need to remove any conflicting Qt version or / etc / ld.so.conf so that Amarok finds the correct version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">Most installation problems are most easily explained by the help of an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search for help with other users or developers. use the forum and IRC under irc.freenode.net in Channel # Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugzilla is not suitable to look for help. please insert only one error, if you have something about fixing a bug in Amarok itself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & Amarok; only appears an empty playlist. how do music pieces come in there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is easy. use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To keep the surface intuitively, the start subwindow was converted to the Statistics window. you can find it under Extras statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars represent the evaluation by the user while the points are calculated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To evaluate plays, the evaluation columns must be displayed in the playlist. click on the title bar of the playlist and select column Show review. click anywhere in the new application column to specify the score for one piece. you can also use the Quick-Command Windows + [1-5]. this also works if Amarok is in the background.</seg>
<seg id="1264">Select the files you want to remove and then press Delete on your keyboard. or right-click on your selection and then select from the drop down menu from the drop down menu.</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you are using the Streamer driver with the Alsa sink, the device must provide a blender. a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio. this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer (e.g. SBLive) or by the dmix module for Alsa (software mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you search for the problem matter and a solution. for GStreamer you may need to specify another ink (e.g., sink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">This does & Amarok; already. do not forget that media must first be decoded. you can not just send an MP3 to ALSA, you would just hear a white noise. GStreamer is the best choice for most people if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead. GStreamer reads the file, decoded it and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">XMMS also decoded the data first. GStreamer can output directly to ALSA, just as xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open control center Sound & Multimedia Sound System. enable sound servers with highest priority (real time priority) and increase the size of the sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure artswrapper SUID is set:</seg>

<seg id="1331">& Amarok; presupposes the installation of some software packages. the required packages are listed below. in addition, some additional packages are listed, which make work with & Amarok; more pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="1332">If you install these packages using a package management system (e.g. RPM or apt), you must also install the development versions of these packages!</seg>
<seg id="1333">& Amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. like any regular multimedia player has also & Amarok; however, a playlist that is superior to all others. the playlists window contains several browsers with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection.</seg>
<seg id="1334">In this chapter, it explains how all the functions of & Amarok are used; including creating a collection and playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The Player window is your one-click & Amarok; control center. at the top of the window there is a running text display showing the currently running piece or the current stream. just below is the area, the playing time, bit rate, and samplerate of the current play. a click on this area changes the display of the remaining play time for the remaining play time of the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, including the runtime display. you can switch by the available Analyzer by clicking with the left mouse button on the area.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the Player window. press d on your keyboard and the current Analyzer is displayed in an independent, magnifiable window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">The PL and EQ buttons can also be found under the scroll bar. the PL button activates or deactivates the playlist window, while the EQ button is used to set up equalizers.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the play position slider. use the slider to adjust the piece position or the volume. with the playback buttons, you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or last piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">Using the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets, from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own presets.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To view the equalizer, use Extras Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you select the Equalizer check box, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The Playlist of & Amarok; is the most advanced playlist of all for & kde; available multimedia players. it has many features that are not available in any other player. but don't be scared of the abundance of features, they're all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The Playlist window can be split into two main sections, the left-hand side is the navigation pane. in the navigation pane, you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist, such as the context browser. on the right, you find the playlist itself.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser displays various information regarding the current piece. its appearance can be adapted using context browser designs. the context browser contains three sub-windows: music, text and interpreter. these three subwindows will be explained in detail later.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & Amarok, you might notice that the start window has dropped off. the information presented here has now been distributed in other parts of & Amarok; the information can also be viewed in the Statistics window (Extras statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music subwindow displays information about the currently running piece, as well as the interpreter and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this subwindow displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, artist and the album. among them you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a MusicCoinz symbol. click on this icon to track the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">See here how often and when the play was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To show cover images in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png are supported. the file formats can have any name, but pictures with the word front in the name are treated preferentially.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on any of these pieces, it will be played instantly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this performer. this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current performer.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set which information should be displayed in the music subwindow. right-click anywhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the artist, lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will work out and you will see the contents of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on any of the pieces in the individual fields to start playing immediately. you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">This function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self-written scripts. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, try & Amarok; to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if no text script is running, you can choose which to start.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button enables you to edit the lyrics. the modified version is then stored in & Amarok's collection database. no running text script is needed for this.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Search button opens a search on google.com after the song text for the running piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Artist - groups only the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter. albums or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Artist / Album - First the pieces are arranged according to the interpreter and below it is performed a further split by the respective album. if you want to see compilations or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Various Interprets.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping Artist / Year - Album - Sorted to Interpret and then after the year of the album in descending order (the latest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All the albums of your collection are displayed in alphabetical order and the interpreter is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping Genre / Interpret - your pieces will appear first sorted by genre and then by interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping Genre / Interpret / Album - This setting works just like the above, but is also sorted by album below the artist.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can adapt and combine the grouping as you like.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically collect your collection once you change something on the selected folders. if you own a lot of pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">Directly below the tool bar there is a search filter. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. hints for using this filter can be found in the section to the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter you find a selection box with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection. you can also select different time windows, starting from the last 24 hours to a year. in addition, you can of course select your entire collection, so that the filter is switched off practically.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser, you will receive the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This will empty the current playlist and add the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Attach to playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on one entry, you will achieve the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Tune the pieces in the queue - This function will add the selected pieces to the queue. this will play you next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as playlists. you will be asked for a name under which the list should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1373">To transfer the pieces to the Media Player, add the pieces to the Media Player. for more details, see the section on the Media Player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this performer / burn to CD - This will cause the selected pieces to be sent to K3b and burned either as data or audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - opens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(n) Modify files in the dustbin... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Marking as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation, and it appears in various interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Digging up a compilation flag - Changes a selected album back into a normal album. after that, the album is no longer listed under Various performers but again under the respective interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlists browser makes it easy to handle many playlists. among other things, it also contains intelligent playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The bottom part of the playlist browser contains the smart playlists. they use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created smart playlists are possible. click Add Smart playlist to open the dialog to create a new Smart playlist, where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The Media Player subwindow is used for the connection of & Amarok; for example, using your portable media player (e.g. iPod). to be able to use your iPod with & Amarok; in / mnt / ipod. if & Amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod by performer sorted in the top list view of the media player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the required titles from the playlist and drop them to the Interpret list. if you are done, click Apply. this will upload the pieces to your iPod. if the transfer is completed, quit & Amarok; and release the drive binding for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar you find a search area with which you can search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can get music from a given URL. if you type tar: / home / mike / musi.tar.gz and press Enter, you can listen to music in the musi.tar.gz file. now you can drag the music from there into the playlist and drop.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, the attachment of files by simply dropping can be difficult. in this case the holding of the Shift key can be helpful: in this case dropped files are automatically inserted at the end of the list, and not at the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">The playlist contains all the pieces attached to play. you can change the order by simply drag the entries into the desired place and drop. as soon as you enter letters, only the pieces that contain the characters will be displayed. to reset the filter, press the back button until the text field is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter delimited search terms by whitespace, & Amarok, search for entries that contain all search terms. for example, if you enter one two, the search will find all entries containing one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you enter OR between the search terms OR searches for entries that contain either the one or the other search term. for example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces that contain one or two or three (or a combination thereof) are found.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries that contain spaces, then enclose the search term with goose feet: Mike Oldfield. this is the search for entries that Mike Oldfield contains, but not for entries like Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a specific search column, you can also search for bigger or smaller ones. for example: rating: &gt; 50th This searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term, set a minus sign before the search term: -something looks for pieces that do not contain something.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variations as you like. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bathroom. this looks for all pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bath.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the sequence of entries by pressing the Ctrl key, and then click the entries with the right mouse button. the entries will then receive a label with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some features of the playlist. on the left, you will find the Add button to add the playlist to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons follow undo and restore, so you can undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the middle of the tool bar is a unique, magnified analyzer. the refresh rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the analyzer.</seg>

<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information on the playlist. it displays the title of the current piece, the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces. furthermore, the status for Random mode and Recover, a slider for the play position and the playing time of the current piece are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. disable the status bar option in the General Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking on the menu in the playlist. using this menu, you can reach the settings of & Amarok;</seg>

<seg id="1409">The queue management got your big move in & Amarok; 1.3. with this function you have even more control over the playlist. after you have set a piece into the queue, the playlist will appear next to the title. this number represents the order in which & Amarok; the pieces will be played: 1 will be played first, 2 as second, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1410">Queue management. when you want to add a piece to the queue, select the item in the playlist and then click +. you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist. you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management.</seg>

<seg id="1463">This dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project. the only difference is the additional button firing, the & k3b; the burning dialog can only be opened when the project already contains data.</seg>
<seg id="1464">Opens the Properties dialog for the current project. here you can make many project-related settings. each project type has different possible settings, most of which are described by the What is that? (accessible via the right mouse button).</seg>
<seg id="1465">This entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. it causes & k3b to import files from a previous session into the current project. this is useful when you compile files for a multi-session CD. the data from the previous session is always included, even if this function is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1466">This entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. this function causes & k3b to remove imported files from the current project. all other files remain in the project. this function removes no files from the medium, it only discloses the previously imported files.</seg>
<seg id="1467">This also allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file. alternatively, you can only create a copy of a CD which you can then burn later on. besides, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of a normal copy. you should prefer cloning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Alternatively, you can only create an image of a DVD that you can then burn later. furthermore, the converting / indexing of a DVD with the help of the copy dialog is not yet supported, so the target medium has to be large enough to record the entire (video) data of the source medium in the original form.</seg>

<seg id="1475">Shows a list of toolbars of & k3b; if an entry is enabled, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">If this is checked, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not checked, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">If the view is enabled, its contents will be displayed in the table of contents. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info, locking and blocking of the drive or ejection of the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The content view enables you to select and drag files into the project view. the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive was selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The header is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the header bar has no real function, it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the view.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog box to change the key assignments for & k3b;. after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part, you can adjust the key assignments for it further down.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This starts k3b; setup wizard. this allows you to set the correct authorizations to burn CDs and DVDs. for this, system administrator privileges are required, so you must enter the system administrator's password when starting the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Open the settings of & k3b; here general program settings can be made. almost all functions of & k3b; should work straightaway. this dialog is intended for personalization and fine adjustment of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; applications also, equipped with a & DCOP; interface. using this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled, for example, via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; functions, you can either use the dcop command line program or the somewhat more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in functionality, so your taste and nature of your task is key in addition to which of the programs you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume you use the dcop command line program. to use the & DCOP; functions, you must first make sure that & k3b; then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions that all & kde; -program have in common, supported & k3b; mainly two more parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP-interface of & k3b; provides functions such as copyCD, formatted DVD and other functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createMovixCDproject () DCOPRef createMovixCDproject () DCOPRef createMovixCDproject () DCOPRef createMovixCDDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDDProject () void copyDvd () void burnCdImage (KURL url) void burnDvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project using the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then get a reference to the project using # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectinterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above K3bProjectinterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectinterface, which can only be applied to data-projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (Qstring name) void createFolder (Qstring name, Qstring Transparent) void addurl (KURL:: list urls, Qstring Transparent) void renameItem (Qstring path) void renameItem (Qstring path, Qstring Names) void setVolume id (Qstring id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to complete a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple folders and then inserts files into the new folders:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDproject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT scan url / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; reader for & kde;. with it can easily be read audio CD; s can be read out and stored in MP3 or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on the hard drive) and by many encoders who encoded these wav files (these encoders must still be installed from the Linux distribution).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First the title of the & CD; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these wav files (usually one per title) are compressed into the MP3- or OGG format or in other formats like lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders must be installed. all of these programs are generally available for any Linux distributions, so it is very likely not necessary to compile anything yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format should be used? chapter Welcher Kodiver gives a small introduction about encoders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, uses & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia to read out the audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to crack any copy protection. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device the protection surrounds, it is not possible to bypass the mechanism of copy protection. simply avoid buying copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up the setup dialog can only be done once (but the setup dialog can be called as often until a suitable configuration is found), the daily handling of the reading of a & CD will be explained. this will (hopefully) lead to an understanding of the lean approach of the user interface, which you will often stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert to many formats - depending on which encoders are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the freedb from the Internet or can work completely without a network, with everything manually collected.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of commands from the main window. step by step Example you will find more information about how this program is used as well as screenshots with descriptions of tabs for the configuration of the program.</seg>

<seg id="1508">Opens a submenu with a list of available encoders, so that the selection can be read with another encoder than the standard. it must be noted that previously the encoder in the encoding settings tab has been configured in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager, so that an already loaded file for encoding is selected instead of a full & CD; to read and to code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notifications (such as protocols, piepsen) for program events (such as reading the & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog by & kaudiocreator; with different flashcards (like Encoder, to set up the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoders, and compression ratios and helps you to choose the right encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC there are also other such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'that may be available for this distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Under the audio formats that lost information through data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate differences are less important as both encoders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O 'not so' free, lame is nevertheless supplied free with most distributions, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high up to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared with OGG slightly lower quality at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG recordings is available.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special auto-stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has already quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a bit less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices require CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a song. good enough for music of teenagers, portable devices and car stereo systems. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the size of the file, choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is entered manually or retrieved by the program from the freedb over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / use it with & kaudiocreator; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with encoding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoders and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; add titles to the keywords (English: day) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title must be added by & kaudiocreator; the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs, so that all others can download this information instead of entering the computer. it is to be noted that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, Artist, Name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (meaning the author) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; information that is publicly available on the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed. any information can be obtained anyway with a stroll through a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is actively an check box to select (Send a address). for the use of freedb it can be used with another (fake) address as the data set up in the system. in this type of configuration, it seems, the email address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (This can only know the programmer who reviewed the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if it is set up to use freedb, the geographically located mirror server should be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit at freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; information during the reading of a & CD; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which file program is used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more exactly, search in the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CDs; see note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the read WAV files, the encoder and the desired file format can be selected. at the first opening, pre-defined lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) can be found on the tab to set the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoders package must be installed by the respective linux distribution before the encoders can be used. this is also required for the predefined encoders. more information about encoders can be found in the chapter Welcher Kodiver.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder, more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and write permissions on it and if both cdparanoia and the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want a copy-protected audio CD; check out the cover of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything but are still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and our first & CD; read out. we'll use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) of 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">Both programs should be installed as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found, for example, with a search engine, as it is considered as non-free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can do of course.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission (eg; by trying to copy something into the konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic set up of & kaudiocreator; something that will probably only be done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each output & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoders to be used for compression of the music (lame) and the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting audio quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps).</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change it at any reading of a & CD; change once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name will be transferred to the reading program so that it can read the & CD; data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your disk. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is present, you can also view the file / etc / fstab and try with the entries of the device names for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card-card General Settings. here there is not much to do. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything is left / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Select only if you have incomplete information, so that you will be informed when details about creating keywords (tags) are missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card-card CD; -Settings. just select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the internet while reading the & CD, so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection box is easier, a & CD; entry is found, immediately starts reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can easily be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1558">You can work with freedb locally in offline mode if you download the database before. however, this is over 620 MB big, consider this twice if this is worthwhile. to freedb in the offline mode, the two choices must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freedb. these are settings for data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freedb server over the internet. how does the system know what data the CD should be received? read the freedb section.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB-Server: please go to freedb.org and look for a mirror server near you. on this path the load is distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equally as far as the server is concerned, but since many firewalls attempt to boot the protocol 8880 by default, there may be more luck with protocol 80, as the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we do not want to send & CD; data to the freedb server. disable the first check box should suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the / tmp directory does exist on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author doesn't know, therefore simply try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; discard the last piece: tick this to the & CD; discard at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then / must the path / folder where the wav files are stored. this can be useful if there is only space on another drive. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything in the same way as on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something must be browsed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as mentioned earlier, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is average about 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the '--id3v1-only' entry for restricting the generation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags may also be deleted if needed. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as shown in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoded wav files: at a dualcore or quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to code more than one wav file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we've just finished the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; this configuration is used as a standard for any reading of a & CD; used. if you have wisely chosen the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section we describe how the process of reading the & CD; runs on the hard drive. we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard drive, was written in the previous section and set up. first, a connection to the Internet is constructed as we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freedb must be retrieved.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not yet included in freedb, the screenshots look a little different from those for a & CD; with successfully fetched data. therefore, you will learn the & CD; data manually, rather than pick it up from the Internet. comments will indicate the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' output of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet done, now the & CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as shown in the screenshot. this only if the & CD; as an audio CD; can be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, look for the help section in the FAQ section, or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully fetched from the freedb, all titles of the pieces have already been filled in and the name of the artist and the album are also displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; key for your & CD; there, a window will be displayed, and you can select the database entry that best fits your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not select the check box for automatic retrieval of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you do not have a local database, but get the data from the Internet, you will need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD Editor - Input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Current Title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer has to be entered in the 'Current Title' input field unless you have a collection of different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for individual comments inidividual per piece, the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name (e.g. whether all words with capital letters begin or not...), but also to check if there are any undesirable comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment area. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudiocreator; maximum allowed. this option is set on the encoder settings section; take a look at the 'Basic Settings' section.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor at any time. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders or file formats. see the help of the encoder to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the tapered CD; in this example, this is not important as we do not transmit the & CD; for more information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK', go back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The CD editor window appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current item.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD; entered.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear if you download the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed above the piece list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece on or off. make sure all pieces are selected, or press the All items button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">When you click on the button Select the selection selection process, this window will appear to confirm. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab Order to switch to the job window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly below the buttons of the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window for controlling orders. the first piece is just read out on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message appears when you try to work with a code that you haven't installed yet. pieces that have not been successfully encoded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folders are not what we have entered here in the example. have you checked if you have write access to the temporary files and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: assignment # 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3. this allows you to read out and code parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that appears configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding. in the case of low-performance machines, the result is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last song is read, while another piece is encoded and a third order is placed in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is encoded, a small window with a message is displayed for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator;, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1621">Supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files (recesses or textual events). kmid automatically determines the procedure used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Session support. when you finish playing a song, kmid will start again next time with the same song.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it will pop up the usual file dialog with which help you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; -windows in the & kmid; window. this also works with multiple songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the Play button in the toolbar, select the entry from the menu item, or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece will automatically start as soon as you drag it onto the & kmid; (in several pieces it will be added to a collection and then played one after the other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once you play a piece, you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and moving back and forth with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click the arrows on the left and right of the TempoCheck to change the playing speed. to get back the original speed, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar acts like pressing the button Pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu, thus interrupts the play. press the space bar while no play is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in one piece of music in two ways. some pieces use text event, others use lyrics and others use both. some pieces do not have a text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid, you can set which events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined which uses a song, so you don't have to manually set the automatic text selection. however, you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set an event type, select the entries and / or song events from the Settings menu. the same function also has buttons 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you put together. these are played back in series. in this section you can see how you can efficiently use collections.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you can find it in the menu Collection below the item Organize.... Click New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copy and then specifying the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original ones.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the desired items in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection is not saved. remember that if you add lots of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the Collection Manager. there, you can add a song using the Add button. again, the file dialogue appears, with which help you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting Automatically add to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic add to the collection is enabled, a piece will automatically be added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If Automatically add to the collection is not enabled, when opening a piece, the temporary collection is activated and emptied. this collection will then be added to the pieces that are still open.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the sequence from the submenu of the player sequence of the menu collections, the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the Collection Manager, or use the drop-down menu above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select the Next song button, select next song from the menu item or press the button arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the button Previous piece, the entry Previous piece from the menu item or press the button arrow on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to delete and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter because it is not saved when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers, which are not general-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map translates general-MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map, which converts all events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the type Change patch to Trumpet and can therefore always be heard when playing a piano.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have one sound card, you don't need a MIDI map because all the sound cards are GM compatible (including Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI maps. so you need to edit the appropriate file manually (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that stores all necessary settings for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once except the Keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, it is necessary for each occurrence to have different text id (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define Keymap "Name of the Keymap..." END Define Keymap "Another Keymap"... END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as email so I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can be for devices that are not General-MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section you specify how the patches of General MIDI are mapped to your specific keyboard. general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equation sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and also leave no row for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to set the sound with the number M on the sound. if your keyboard doesn't support a gun (GM-Patch 127), you can use a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which sounds similar to a gun. to do this, enter the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if now a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 (gun shot), it takes Patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here is the term drum patch of the patch, where every sound is a different percussion instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas & etc;) and not the one where the sound is the pitch of the always same drum (as some keyboards have it).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The Keymap section is used to specify how tones are mapped to a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important as well as their presence. so you must create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keymaps for each channel and instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to map sounds on the percussions-channel. look at the provided keymaps as an example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and the second channel, just make it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However these settings are more useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a particular channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section therefore has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel which is mapped to the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the Keymap with the name name is needed for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events that attempt to change the patch on this channel will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1674">For example, the ForcePatch can be useful to always use the percussions-patch on the percussions-channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio indicates in what ratio Pitch-Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch Bender event with the value n, it is converted to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then passed on. the value 4096 is used to prevent decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is used because GM pretends that a pitch Bender event is supposed to play a pitch higher with the value 4096. unfortunately, however, some keyboards attempt to play two tones up to one octave up. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, just open the MIDI Settings dialog. you can find it in the Settings menu, point MIDI Settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole row of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you can see which sounds are played straight.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button lights no more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (up to now) two different views to display the played sounds. view the View menu in the Settings menu under the Point Channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. for example, if you find a song too fast to follow the lyrics, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & etc; that the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anyone to use kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; this happens because & kmid; it has been compiled without AWE support. to remove the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example by kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I do not want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">OK, therefore supported & kmid; drag and drop. just open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all the files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Check the Auto Add to Collection previously. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key to the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the default tempo, you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & kde; -Desktop with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (when I play a MIDI file) or attached (when I play a karaoke file) or I want to play a file, just change to the & konqueror; -windows and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid; drag.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you only want to listen to a file quickly without adding it to a collection, turn the setting Automatically add to the collection, and the new; file is added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. First you only want to play the first file. so, set the Automatic Add to Collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection will then contain exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, that animates me to continue programming.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrose.Jimenez; from Maacute; laga (Spain). I'm studying mathematics at the university of Maacute; laga. currently I am in the third year, so I do not have much leisure time for my hobbies but I try to take a bit of time.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files if you have a question, an error or an idea for an expansion of & kmid; or if you just want to make me happy, write me an email: larpink @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrais.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">If you send me a postcard from your home or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will count among friends of & kmid; if you want to send a MIDI file, you should contact me, since I may already have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid, completely written in my spare time, and no one has gotten money on it. I would like to stress that I can only be more programmatic because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch was too high for AWE cards.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks also to Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the AWE support, Ignacio Garcia for testing the AWE support, Has Petter Bieker, Marc Diefenbruch, Peter Gritsch, Magnus Pepa, Urko Lusa, Peter-Paul Witta, Thorsten Westheider, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who provided me with a patch, an error correction or just a supporting email.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course, my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the web, who give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition, it can be found on his homepage, which is located under http: / / www.arracis.es / ~ rlarpink / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, search for information and look at pictures. you will also find links to pages with other karaoke songs, & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, since the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same if you are using a FM radio device or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you need to compile & kmid with the MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYCUAL parameter. it then runs as if you had a sound card, except that you can't listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & kde; -Mailing lists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple interface for MPlayer, Phono and ffmpeg. the program is used to play video files supported by MPlayer or Phonon supported formats, as well as to play DVD's, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappend; it was not finished as & kde; installed on this machine.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help please check the page The KDE Website for new versions, or send the question to The & kde; User Mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. alternatively, there is the window with the playlist. and finally, there is an information window that is displayed only when information is returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred links under the bookmarks menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category of continuous playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to create an additional hierarchical level. if you click on an entry, its group and all its subgroups will be copied to the current category and the playback begins with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The different files in the directory ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer /, can be changed by an editor, but also by the application itself. simply click on a name of a category to select from the View menu and next editing mode. by clicking a subgroup, only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to choose playlists from the playlist and choose either the editing mode or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without using the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the ease of the author of & KMPlayer; some features can only be activated by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation for starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayer errc and modify [General Options] No intro = 0 oblige option on '1'. if the option is not present, it can be easily inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during startup does not need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. however, this would be disturbing at the end animation, the user can therefore finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite picture: & lt; & lt; body; & lt; img dur = "intra radius" src = "file: / / / home / Koos / mum.gif" fit = "meet"; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / / / home / Koos / mum.gif; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / / / home / Koos / mum.gif; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / / / home / Koos / mum.gif; & lt; / stats; & lt; / / / home / Koos / mum.gif; & lt; / / / home / Koos / mum.gif; & lt; / / / home / Koos / mum.gif; & lt; / / / home / Koos / mum.gif; & lt; / / / home / Koos / mum.gif; & lt; / / / home / Koos / mum.gif; & lt; / / / home / Koos / mum.gif; & lt; / / / home / Koos / mum.gif; & lt; / / / home / Koos / mum.gif.</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the 'Console' button in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here is the output of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this rendition in the Configuration dialog from & KMPlayer; everything must be configured by manual editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayer errc, just like setting the backend via mimetype. here is an example how a 'flash' is played with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & KMPlayer; it can even insert the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">To use the & KMPlayer; 'flash' in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module must be specified as service provider for the Mime-type application / x-shockwave-flash in the setup dialog file assignments of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; is in a console application to start and search for error messages concerning loading the browser module library. if there are no errors, the backend issue is within & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu to check).</seg>
<seg id="1726">To always use a given backend for a particular mime type (of course, only if this has been determined), this must be done by changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayer errc. for example, Phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play from TV cards, either using a MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be watched, the device to be used and the TV channels need to be configured. to do this, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configure the VDR (video data recorder) settings in the KMPlayer is the dialog in the settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there, ports should be detected, one of which is selected. the code to be used must be found (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a dvb in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of KMPlayer can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the videoforlinux extension must be functional for the X server. therefore, the XFree86 server must contain the following in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally by KMPlayer, different names are used for the sources. at the time of the creation of this documentation, this is dvdnavsource, dvdsource, exitsource, versource, pipesource, tvscanner, TVSource, url source, vcdsource and vdrsource. if enabled, they start playing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Is there any way I can make my CDROM volume quieter when I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command HDPARM -E 8 / dev / cdrom is the root user to run the device. it is absolutely necessary to make sure that / dev / cdrom drives on the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine only starts up slowly, why must my CPU be tested for its performance every time?</seg>
<seg id="1734">Note: the answer is overtaking. kxineplayer will automatically need the last stored value, only the first time xine will check the CPU.</seg>

<seg id="1765">When using the check-up search, the elements of the DVI; file are linked to the editor and once clicked on an element in the DVI; file, the corresponding section in the & latex; source text is clicked.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used for working with multiple files. with a master document, work with other embedded .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set to project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Fast Construction: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (unless there are any errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File surveillance: in this mode, the DVI; file will be "waking over" in no time, no call from & occulars; after the fast construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the Edit tool bar, the three large selection fields should be visible. the selection fields have been developed for the quick classification of the document into parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex; -instructions for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The other selection box is for inserting items such as keywords, nodes or references. the available options are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: this command will create a name for a section, a picture or a different item.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: is used for reference to a specified term (selection via a selection box possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">The author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can also be written in & Kile; manually.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-down box with the name Gray is used for the definition of the font. it can be set the characters for the main text, the vertices, etc. the following fonts are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & Kile, there are two choices available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting document type and setting the settings.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets after the command\\ documentclass contain the settings for the command. the [12pt] set defines the font size. if font size is not set at the beginning, this can also be done later in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the source code above has been entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is to use the Menue building or the quick-release button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved prior to compiling. & Kile; it automatically extracts the file.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compiling of the document fails, it should be searched for errors in the logging process. when using Fastening should & eyepiece, it should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be observed.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font size 12 is created and only a few columns should have a different font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} will then have the validation of the lettering within the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are only overdone within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}. there is no narrowing (number) for changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the legibility and user-friendliness of the document. for example, you can add certain fonts, bold prints, cursive prints, subtitles, etc. these commands either end with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for recursive expression and is valid until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or any other environment.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quotation in the document. the quote starts with\\ begin {quote} and ends with\\ end {quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background to writing the source code with the & latex; markup language was presented, now follows a step-by-step instructions for creating a document in & dump;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">As soon as a bit of text was entered in the wizard, some adjustments should be made for the better readability of the document. at least one quotation, a few passages in bold and italics, and a poem should be used to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, the editor view or Ctrl-E can be converted back to the editor (internal viewer).</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file has been created, the document can be printed or converted to a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try out and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent file format. these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF -converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file, the same steps as for the creation of the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI; file was created from the & latex; source code, the conversion into desired other formats can begin by means of the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The pre-search request allows direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position inside the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; offers a suitable setting for all & latex; - binaries. for this purpose only Modern can be set up under Settings...</seg>
<seg id="1794">To select the preferred search, the mouse pointer must be positioned in a line of the source text and then clicked on for pre-search. the jump to the corresponding location in DVI; the viewer is then taken.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the respective & latex; -document by & Kile; opened and jumped to the appropriate line. to do this, & Kile; in & eyepiece; set as text editor (Setting up eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If you don't open the & DVI, you can have an error. if there is an error, it will be displayed in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file lists the source text error source. in the editor, the buttons Previous LaTeX errors and Next LaTeX errors can be used between the errors. the log file always specifies the line in which the error appears. to view the defective line, it must be clicked on the error in the logging and & dump; jump to the incorrect line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once clicked on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window appears to select the template to be used for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting an empty document, a document can either be rewritten either from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document. more information can be found in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">HÃ ¤ufige users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be stored in & dump; created, stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or a new file must be created. & Kile; can create a new template using an existing document and selecting File Template from document...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a file called New, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set in Settings boxes... settings can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings are substituted by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is substituted by entering the document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {items}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created this way, the following steps must be executed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, its own template can then be selected instead of the standard one.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the internet and the steps described above are searched.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Posters; used as an internal editor. & Posters; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility to read and emphasize many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;). lots of settings for & kate.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about posters and its possibilities, the manual should be consulted to Kate. users of & Kile; can begin there directly with reading the chapter's work with the editor of & kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; offers a very practical & latex; command reference which can be called via the menu help LaTeX Reference. it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands which can be found in & latex; and its syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double click with Ctrl key to select the & tex; this means that by clicking on\\ par\\ par\\\\\\\\\\\\ par\\ par\ par.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with a pressed Shift key, parts of the source code can be selected in the editing pane.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to search for different kinds of source texts and emphasize them. for example, the natural latex; -commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can add additional jump marks. this is a special type of bookmark within the text. the menu entries Edit bounce brands or the corresponding keys allow the jump to the next or last jump mark. this is also highlighted by this jump mark, so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as & Kile; though & makes; already excellent possibilities, were added in & dump; important functions for writing a & latex; source code is always added; special commands for their selection. under Edit Select the following commands for selecting text:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Heats a complete paragraph (group of lines containing an empty line on both sides). this extended meaning does not include tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code. the only bent thing in & dump; is that the paragraphs are separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Choose the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning since this command also provides & latex; -commands with a return line (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">For listening to a part of the document, it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Delete key. & Posters; offers the key Ctrl; K with which the whole line is removed. & Kile; offers with own commands here for a faster possibility. under Edit Remove the following commands to delete the text are included:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & Kile; is included in the description to Edit Select Inserts paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarified that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & Kile; for further orders under Edit surroundings for a very simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command will jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command will jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to lieg the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is located before or within the\\ begin {environment} command, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested environment commands, the overview can be lost quickly. this command completes the recently opened environment, so that the nested environment structure is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups which are determined by braces {...}. under Edit TeX group are some important commands that correspond to those from the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command you jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command will jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the curvented clasp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is located before or behind the braced bracket of a & tex; group #, jump to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">With the input of many nested, brazed groups-clasps, the overview can be lost quickly. this command completes the last opened group, so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple quotation marks are used as a seal. for the beneficial implementation it is used in & Kile; the mark "is used for two simple quotation marks. also for the end of the mark the mark" is used. & Kile; knows this case and adds two final touch marks for natural latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic insert of the double quotation marks can be set under settings Kile... LaTeX can be turned on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">You can also use dictionable settings (e.g. German or French), and therefore German or French call marks. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When pressing Shift key; enter & tilt; an intelligent line break. if the current position is located within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & Kile; not only a newline but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>

<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange the columns in tables environments and all Et characters (amp;) each other. & Kile; tries to make this possible. while pressing Shift + Alt; amp; searches & boxes; after the next tab in the upper row.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & Posters; already offering a good source code completion, this has been expanded in & Kile; three different modes are installed. three of them are working on demand and the other two are for automatic execution. all of these modes can be set up for different ways of working under Settings... Completely adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="1839">At the beginning a new environment is started by the command\\ begin {environment} & dump; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the back button, the last letter of the input is removed and thus the complete list of characters is possible. on the other hand, the list can also be reduced by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions are removed from the selection of a command. alternatively, jump marks can be inserted, so that a simple jump to these positions can be possible using the jump-mark NÃ ¤thest jumping mark and the desired parameters can then be added.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings Kile; set up... boxes; complete settings can be made to these lists. you can select different wish lists for & tex; - and & latex; -commands as well as library books of the general language use.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not useful for the completion of environments. there must always be a few letters with\\ begin to be entered and the invoking of the completion mode will result in a large list of environment commands. on the other hand, the environments are so often used that & dump; a special mode for completing the environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the finishing mode over the menu edit environment or buttonkey Alt + Shift key, the command to run the environment is automatically frozen and it appears\\ begin {. afterwards, the environment can be continued in the simplest way and ended by pressing the input key.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this has been completed, the environment will be automatically closed again. as soon as & Kile; realize that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command will be added.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings box; set up... boxes; complete settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the list of complete termination mode for & tex; - and & latex; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Kile; supports custom lists of backups that are immediately replaced by older strings. the lists can be set up under Settings boxes... boxes can be set up. as an example of a drop-down list, the file example.cwl, in which for example the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is entered and the word processing mode is initiated over the Edit menu or the keyboard Ctrl + Alt spacebar, the letter L is replaced by the character string\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large quivers are not helpful for automatic completion. however, it has been found that many killers are written more than once in a document.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the menu settings... boxes can be destroyed. here, the threshold value can also be specified for the display of the completion.</seg>

<seg id="1852">The dialog box displays graphics as easy as possible. to overview the basics to the graphic formats, the sections should be considered and noted.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as well-known as PDF files, but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages. if the PDF output is required, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; tools and then converted with ps2pdf into a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">In order to examine the result of the work, the source code must be compiled. all building tools are compiled in groups in the creation, compilation and creation view.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source code for viewer like & eyepiece; or the further conversion can be used the keyboard individual Alt; 2. afterwards, the DVI; file can be viewed in the default viewer using Alt; 3, using Alt; 4, the DVI; file can be viewed in a PS file and by means of Alt; 5 the PS file.</seg>

<seg id="1912">Local and global variables are shown on an index card in the Xsldbg Inspector dialog. the following example shows XSLT source code in which a global and a local variable is declared</seg>
<seg id="1913">Clicking on a variable from the list gives a summary of the information in the dialog below. if a variable expresses a particular expression, for example</seg>
<seg id="1914">Then a new XPath can be selected by entering a new value for the variable expression and clicking the Print button.</seg>
<seg id="1915">When clicking a variable entry in the list, the text pointer will be placed in the main window to the corresponding line of this file.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The version 3.2 of & quantaplus; contains many new & XML; tools and functions. these tools are unique in their integration in & quantaplus; all of these tools use commanders as surface and libxml2 and libxslt as a base. the combination yields fast, efficient, complete and productive tools.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Anyone who has worked with the & kde; documentation knows my proc and how outstanding it is. let's take it a bit, we give it a graphical interface! no more dependent on a terminal; simply clicked the icon for the XML processor and done!</seg>
<seg id="1918">This application expects an index.docbook in the folder. if index.docbook is located in the desired folder, then leave the current work folder. if not, then remove the selection of current work folders and specify it in the other folder's field.</seg>
<seg id="1919">Output files are stored in the same folder as the source files. all previous & HTML; files will be deleted every time my proc is started.</seg>
<seg id="1920">As I said before, anyone who has worked at the & kde; documentation already knows how helpful this application is. and with & quantaplus; there is now a great graphical interface for that.</seg>
<seg id="1921">If the opened file is index.docbook, then just leave the current work folder. if not, then select the current work folder and enter the folder where index.docbook is to be found.</seg>
<seg id="1922">When it comes to output on the screen, your file is faulty. please check the reported errors and try again.</seg>
<seg id="1923">If the file to be checked is already marked in & quantaplus, then they simply hook up the current file. if not, they will delete the checkbox in the current file and select the file to be scanned using a different file - file selection.</seg>
<seg id="1924">If you just want to know if the well-formed file is, click the Well-formed check option.</seg>
<seg id="1925">To use a & DTD; specified in the & XML; file, select & DTD; (default), otherwise & DTD; (External) and specify the location of the & DTD; file selection. both for the & W3C; & XML; schema as well as for the Relax review is the definition of definition URI; file selection required.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Yes, & quantaplus; has also a & XSL; processing tool! this uses the xsltproc tool from libxml2 library.</seg>
<seg id="1927">If the file to be processed in & quantaplus is already selected, then it is easy to select the current file. if not, remove the selection from the current file and select the file to be processed using the other file's file selection.</seg>
<seg id="1928">Enter the name of the file as the result should be named. the file is usually stored in your home folder.</seg>
<seg id="1929">The plug-ins that & quantaplus; invite, have with & quantaplus; even possibly do little to do. this makes the plugin system very powerful. you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone uses the desired in & quantaplus; plugins can be used in a large number of & GUI; elements.</seg>
<seg id="1930">To install a plugin or a part, we start with the Edit menu. this opens the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows you to manage all of the included plug-ins and add new ones. we describe each & GUI; -element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plug-ins without a location, & quantaplus; this path to searching the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often on a project several people work in a kind of hierarchical relationship with each other. & quantaplus; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured using Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the nickname of the user and is used for unique identification purposes.</seg>
<seg id="1935">A member can have several roles in the project, such as team leaders and sub-project leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can select from the list of team members who he is. this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the Setze button. the currently selected member (their identification) appears bold after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the setting of your own identity are important in terms of news and comments. see for more information on comments.</seg>
<seg id="1938">Apart from an overview of their team there is another advantage by capturing members of the team: an event that can be created for information to the team leaders when something specific happens. see in for more detailed information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something specific is happening in the project. an example would be recording the opening and closing of the project so that later you can see how much someone worked on it, or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that takes a file to CVS as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the event configuration of the Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog, events can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email is sent to the addressee selected in the recipient list. the address can be a team or sub-project leader. see how such conductors are set up.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Comments are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by the following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">To enter comments is simple. either the note entry can be selected from the editor context menu or the @ annotation keyword can be entered in a comment area followed by comment text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Notes can be sent to a specific member of the team. in this case, the syntax is @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), with nickname being the nickname of the team member.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roles names are case-sensitive, but spaces around the brackets and the: make the note invalid.</seg>
<seg id="1946">& quantaplus; is a development environment for scripting and formatting languages that is an agnostic and supports web-based formatting and scripting languages.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The settings can be reached via the Settings menu. here, only about & quantaplus; -specific settings are treated, a short description for the others can be found.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The settings can be set up by means of Settings Quanta... This dialog covers a number of pages which are treated consecutively.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behavior of & quantaplus; regarding tags including auto completion can be changed. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / lowercase of tags: large / lowercase of automatically inserted tags. normal / lowercase means the tags are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tagrXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / lowercase of attributes: large / lowercase of automatically added attributes. normal / lowercase means that the attributes are inserted in such a way as they are described in the XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically include: if checked, for tags, for which the closing tag is optional, this will be inserted immediately after & gt;</seg>
<seg id="1953">Do not include optional tags automatically: as above for all other tags except for simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Automatically update the start and finish day: if enabled, the corresponding closing tag is changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic creation of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into the corresponding encoding while typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for the detection of different types of files. the default settings can be restored using the Default button.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file Open opened files (where the encoding of the file can be skipped).</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD was not recognized. however, this setting will be affected by the same in the project features if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Create a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates backup copies on a regular basis, so that during a power failure or crash at the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup. this is not the same as saving the file. even for unsaved documents, a backup is created regularly according to the set time.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in your own view (or the documentation in a tab), which makes it possible to view the documentation, preview and source text at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Reset the window settings to the default back at the next start is useful when the user interface is confused by changing the MDI Modi and andocken / dependencies of views. it corresponds to the --resetlayout command line parameter.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning message area is used to control the possibility of switching warnings from non-polluting alerts.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The location to change the behavior of & VPL; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the VPL- and source-text view in shared mode.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree, representing the representation of parser nodes in the document, can be set into details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structure tree the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the Structure-Tree-Settings section, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the updating frequency of the tree when editing and how deep when changing the structure tree is to be opened automatically. empty nodes are the empty spaces in the text while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Shortcuts are grouped into groups, each can be valid for multiple & DTEP; s. this means there can be a valid group for PHP, in which the ifcation short abbreviation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Here the plug-ins can be managed. plugins are KPart applications from third party, which can be reused by any KPart-enabled application, the most known & konqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following must be stated:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not located at a standard like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plugin at startup, so it can open the current file, the associated folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">"" "load" "" "Read Only" "" "mode: check if the plug-in refuses to load." "" "only" "" "read-only" "" "parts normally refuse loading if this option is not selected." ""</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if this is enabled, then test & quantaplus; if the information entered is correct. choose to save the item even if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, troubleshooting has been completely redeveloped. the support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) debugger has been set, as well as support for the DBG debugger.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plugin is available, supporting the use of & gubed; inquantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable Debugger plugin in the project settings. with the Options button next to the Debugger plugin selector, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all holding points are listed with line numbers and conditions. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as in HTML) of the debugger is shown. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action the connection to debugger, if necessary, or it tells the plugin to listen to debug requests. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened, which uses a debugger, so normally it does not have to be taken care of.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to debugging session starts the session. closes the connection to debugger or terminates the listening according to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a debug request. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and running information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens, while the script is stopped, the execution will continue.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without sending information to oversaw variables and the current line number. if this happens, while a script is stopped, the execution continues.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger executes the next statement in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger executes the next statement in the script, where possible in functions and include is corrected.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to skip the statement and proceed to the next as if there were no current ones.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered, which should be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog, a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1991">& kxsl; is a work by Keith Isdale as well as this part of the documentation. & kxsl; ist ein & kde; front end and a KPart of xsldbg, which they can find on http: / / xsldbg.sf.net with many more works by Keith.</seg>
<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how you can & quantaplus; adapt to your needs and how you can and quantaplus; help to become better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type editing packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus. they allow & quantaplus; they enable & quantaplus; their simplicity and flexibility makes aus & quantaplus; their simplicity and flexibility makes aus & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages or & CSS;. & DTEP; s consist of two parts, the tag folder and the tool bar. tag folders contain two file types, the tag folder and the tool bar. tag folders are handy, symbolic boxes of picture buttons (above the editing window), which insert text and instructions more quickly into a document than a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how to create TagXML files, then the descriptionrc; and also tool bar. in short, one & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog, the & quantaplus; for the day. the & descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars allow a quick insertion of tags into a document without risk of spelling error.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folders. they only contain the descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folders carry the name of the description language and version, so present. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the tagged XML and declares whether they are necessary, or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information in working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about possibilities and limits is presented in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but it contains nothing else than just element type.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when used, attr &gt; is an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only for the class class. the name of the base class for this class. (family only)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Applies only to the type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (family only 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tag can be added to any other day. (only family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text into the dialog. this text is defined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">This element can only occur once for each attribute. it sets the name and type of the attribute. in addition, it contains additional tags describing how this attribute is to be displayed & etc; This is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source code used to fill in the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; is used to achieve the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus; is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a interface and a method name. the arguments passed to the method can be empty or% tag name%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag that group together the elements of a list. it can occur for an attribute description only once. it is an element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Defines the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tag that is to be defined. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that terminate a tag. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with a & XML; -declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces do not affect anything, but be aware of & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; especially in elements such as & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt;. to refrain from doing this will not cause a leg interruption, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is open at the top of the & quantaplus; window to start and check TagXML. another dialog will appear, whose simple instructions are to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, it is only checked for loading the TagXML files in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2021">The following is an example of a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this TagXML file should be schema.day.</seg>
<seg id="2022">The following is an example of a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file, a & PHP; overload function is described. the filename of this TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt; tag name = "overload" type = "function" returnType = "void" &gt; & lt; attr name = "class _ name" type = "optional" / &gt; & lt; / tag &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The file descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for using DTD edits DTD settings. with this, diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] version = turn 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD statement. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN) Nickname = The simplified name of the DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with settings actions... clicking on New action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The shortcut assigned to this action. by clicking the user defined button, a shortcut can be assigned; with Kone, the current keyboard shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the defined settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that change the document or use it as input (or parts of the document). examples from & quantaplus; even the quick start dialog or the various see in... actions for (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be given. example: SH / home / myhome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. This way tries to find the script at the following locations: $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / scripts in its path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we are replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file: / from the document name is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with PGD of the current & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text will be added unique to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; it is used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above listed methods, a script input from & quantaplus can be found at the default input. in the input box input can be determined what to send to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is normally only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be redirected. there are two types output: normal output, written to the standard output; error messages, to the standard error output. it can be specified, what should be done with the text written to the standard output by setting the input field output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create an own toolbar for each group. in the given case, it is not too many, therefore you can create a toolbar with the name of the markup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar has been added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings to set actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts the editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "complete all and, if the tag has attributes and you plan their use, enable" "" "Edit Details" "" "dialog when available so that an input while using the action is possible." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">Undo! is this a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let us replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that represents the action better, we will use & kiconedit; select from the & KMenu;, Graphic More Programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixels by default, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit Size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the start of the tag, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually called los, starte, further interpreted), or at least, a message to the user will be indicated that clicking on this icon will be displayed & lt; tag in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it still needs to be connected to the action. this happens via the menu with settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. in addition to the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored icon is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the user button and continue with other tags, as there are still some, or confirm with OK to finish.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some usual & quantaplus; add functions to the toolbar or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview by some separators.</seg>
<seg id="2052">After selecting the element to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to have a quick way to access the Konqueror Preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support the grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by halving all the symbols to make sure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Back up in the right folder. after reXML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your tool bar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust their descriptionrc; so that their toolbar (s) will be loaded (s) when a file is opened by the respective type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language that you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how to create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; repository if someone has done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / scripting / etc; -language. then you need to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, for example php42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for these documentations e.g. & PHP; 4.2 Documentation Section 1 = Section1.html... [Context]</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see now in PHP & PHP; documentation like this:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config file [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the depth of the box (except for reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">You notice that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top of the tree view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces do not affect anything, but be aware of & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file that is used to design context-sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function should be displayed. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (context list) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of context elements delimited by underscore (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your file docrc to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local and global usage. then create a folder (as you specified it in your docrc file) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation to it.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worthy to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation was used to use the & quantaplus; -community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the disk resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or else to whom. at different places there is an e-mail menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, tool bar tool bar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Resources can be uploaded to our main archive, from where all other & quantaplus; users can download it. to make a contribution we recommend to sign the resources for which it needs a GPG / PGP key. this ensures the origin of resources, both for our team and for the future users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for their private GPG key after their passphrase (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can select one. in Dialogue New Resource you need to fill in the input fields (URL preview can remain empty) and click OK to start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The upload can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP), upload tool bar toolbars, and start in the context menu of files and folders in the template and script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, we investigate and quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signification. in case of problems it warns and it can then be cancelled. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the indication of the resource of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages currently not supported by & quantaplus; however, creation may be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files in XML format might be necessary. there's the easier way to convert a DTD into a DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD menu and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description to be used. after that the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Destination Name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype definition line: the string that appears in! doctype tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, & quantaplus; after conversion the descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. in order to understand these and full benefits from and quantaplus, one must first familiarize themselves with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to explain them exactly these concepts without their understanding & quantaplus; little use.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project related. this distinction affects a number of components in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for anyone who uses & quantaplus. from toolbars to actions, everything that is selected as global is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool bars, actions and patterns in the global tree that are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that only this user can personally use them.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are available only within a specific project. this can be anything from & CSS to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply said, this is the most constrained size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which empowers the common use of special tools and samples from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the Editor window, the builder window, the boxes with information and the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the tabs with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, such as closing the current, other or all tabs, reloading, deleting or uploading of the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS orders to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click in the editor range leads to a further context menu with regard to the edited document contents, such as basic processing steps (cut / paste / paste), edit the tag under the mouse cursor, or open the file when the string is called a file under the mouse cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editor window, the tool bars of the editor are located. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional is a standard for which a set of tool bar is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and thus connected user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of tool bar is really easy. if you want to insert a single tag, e.g. & lt; insert it into your document, then click the icon that represents the tag. now you can insert the data for this just inserted day. if you want to insert a tag that has several attributes (such as anchors), you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The tree views (QIT;) allow you to navigate and browse the information to & quantaplus. in the presentation with tabs stand for files, project, pattern templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation tree views.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus. this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouseclick. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting files from the storage media can be done with the displayed context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website, etc; There are all possibilities open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used. the category depends on the & quantaplus; work area. global templates are always available, local templates only for the corresponding user and templates in projects are only usable in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of breakdown in global, location and project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button you can access the information available to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, one displays the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right clicking an element opens a list of commands related to navigation and refresh of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. with it, it can quickly change attributes and namespaces. the application system that is aligned with the content allows to change all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project, project-specific documentation can be added, edited and considered.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two tabs at the bottom of the window, can be accessed via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab shows information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to the DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the current document markup. & quantaplus; -scripts that are executed give all error messages (so which ones) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the tool bar is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; send the tool bar as compressed Tar Archive via & kmail;. if they receive a toolbar in an email, they can secure and load them in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the & quantaplus; for this autoconf has a number of options which can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are simple to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems when starting & quantaplus; if you have problems with starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 is located in the PATH in front of their bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE desktop. & quantaplus; optimized for rapid web development and combines a well-engineered development environment with a variety of powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML; editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus; an independent, extensible markup language editor would? well, this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer on pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now widely on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then should & quantaplus; therefore the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be held that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & Co. developer community. & quantaplus; follow, in good use of free software, the idea of Why develop what anyone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; framework is not only this all possible, but allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document interface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of automatic actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is almost every task possible.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it has been designed for fast web development and has been quickly expanded to a well-engineered editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is not in any way connected with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">To find out more in the details, use help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; or khelpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and maintained by Eric Laffoon sequencing @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, and the oldest record is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use. look in the section on templates. if they attempt to save the selected file / text outside the local / project file folder, only one error will be reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts when inserting from the clipboard there special characters for & html; -write, so that they are displayed correctly and are not misunderstood by the browser as a formatting instruction.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard to & URL; -write which is the correct way to insert specific characters and spaces in & URL; s. primarily for inserting & URL; s in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Enables you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful when your & PHP; -script releases error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window where you can see the display of script actions and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">The problem reporter on the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as you change to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Shows the symbol column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next, depending on the cursor position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other open documents appear in the menu according to the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from disk. & quantaplus; projects will be saved with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Displays a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. that allows you to copy video files to your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project to the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde, and whether you have downloaded further input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus; the project manages. in chapter & quantaplus; projects you will find the details explained.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbar. these are stored in project tools / toolbars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your tool bar. allows you to select the type of tool bar: locally or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. that just creates the name. actions need to be added by settings actions... added. tool bars are saved by toolbar toolbars or you will be asked when you exit, if you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. this does not delete it from disk. if you haven't yet saved the tool bar, you will be asked if you want to do this.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team so the toolbar is available in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows the uploading of toolbars to the main server, where everyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Loading a & DTD;, which has made you or anyone else and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP are to be freshened up without renewing the whole & DTEP; if this is global and there is no write permission in the global KDE folder, the load fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbars. if the default (HTML;) tool bar is loaded, there is a sub-menu standard in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current tag settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always available in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific sub-menus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activating or deactivates the smart insertion of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent insertion means that & quantaplus; the insertion is refused by means of toolbar if this tag contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plugins menu, the available plugins are listed under the menu items listed above. click on them. clicking on an activated plug will deactivate it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Selects the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on the type; version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop. select Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; tidy by external application.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Instant switching between the different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching sometimes may need time or cause unnice graphics. the flashcard mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains an entry for each open sub-window. selecting an entry activates the corresponding subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Enables the display of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog will affect any application using the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Set the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & kate, you will find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbar or which you can add and change sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should generate a help according to the environment of the mouse-pointer, but is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project, developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be filled up from top to bottom, as the entire directory structure for the rest of the project is automatically completed, e.g. after completing the project name. all of these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift; F7 Project Properties Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering name, file is filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here is the server address of the machine you want to access, except you edit local data. either a name (hostname.fr) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If this field is empty, the default settings of the selected protocol will be used. depending on the remote host setting, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates are saved for the project. it is a relative path to the project and default templates. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the tool bars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows you to insert files from the local filesystem into the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. for server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Let it be checked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included. if a project is started from scratch, do not hook up.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an exact selection according to your credit.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the files you want by tick or by removing the checkbox from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that make your work easier. in the Project Properties menu, these settings can be uploaded to the Project Properties menu in the menu tree in the menu tree or Shift + F7 keyboard shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the Project Assistant and are described in detail. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (placeholders possible), which are ignored for project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, also files listed in .cvsignore, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This can be used to select the desired debugger. currently, only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger plugin can be set with the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the Profile Upload section, upload profiles (see in) can be set, as well as the display of a tree view for each profile by contacting your own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the Team configuration window, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow, event actions can be disabled and these actions can be added, changed or deleted. event actions are executed when a pre-defined event occurs, such as backing up a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, open & quantaplus; the last project that was open. you can't influence this behavior at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Open Project... from the Project menu or the Project icon Open from the toolbar. the dialog Open Project will be displayed and allows selection of a project. projects have .webprj as enlargement.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file is automatically saved. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project tree view gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folder behave as well, but the opening and opening entries are missing with the right mouse button on the right-click context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here different profiles can be selected. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removal of the current profile. if there is only one profile, the button is blinded to prevent removing.</seg>
<seg id="2183">This option is useful when frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather unsafe password on the disk save option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus; many upload profiles can be created and the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. editing or creating a profile will display this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server on which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should select from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this does not have to be changed, except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your angst wave, this is either a time-saving feature or a danger. use it at your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so that it cannot be read easily, but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and toolbars. there can be a lot of views in a project, i.e., by simply changing the view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be opened, opened or deleted from the Project or Project Toolbar menu, accessible from the tool toolbar project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with which one has the most to do. this not only helps increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of and quantaplus; to their own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, tool bar lists are stackable in & quantaplus. the best thing about the tool bar menu can be set. the addition of tool bar is treated below in the Adding tool bar section.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The tool bar and the symbols on it can be set either by context menu (right-click on the toolbar), in which New Action, a New toolbar can be created, other actions such as tool bar can be removed, tool bar rename or toolbars can be executed, indicating which actions should be visible on this or other tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, the entries will be removed and action edited, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and actions on them can set up toolbars in the Settings menu... and set settings actions.. set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially document skeletons, code snippets and files to link. & quantaplus; used templates basically like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or link any existing directory into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the limitations one imagines for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template prior to use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually included in documents using links (e.g. pictures with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. more information on the template tree is available in.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be of any type of text. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. normally, more specialized documents can be found in appropriate subfolders. a few examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. see in for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of template is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should always be inserted in the documents. you can include everything from a comment to a final grade to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl. some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for whole web sites. they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure as you like (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and select File As Template Save As Local Template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this is done, note that (even if it has been saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As Template Save Selection as Local / Project Template. alternatively, the selection can be easily dragged and dragged to the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. all file management functions can be used for it, such as pulling and dropping or pasting over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder on the right in the file tree or in the Project Files to create a name for the template and back up. by default, it is saved in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very goal-oriented approach. you can give headers and footers or dynamically with & PHP; design, add files or link them with them. additionally, you can keep some things in mind when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates / share / apps / quanta / templates. each of these folders is one of four types of containers, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder, right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is dazzled when parental attributes have been verbalized.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits all except the regular folders in the template overview. if a root folder is set so it would generally disable templates in this path unless they are explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like a text module. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows for a predefined or re-represented text for templates in this folder. this could be general headers or footers for all templates for a specific project and allows for copying of content templates to a folder with special headlines / footers to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">You can also use the context menu (to show right mouse button) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and pasting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; provides two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & source text editor that can be accessed from the View menu. the first mode replaces the source text editor by the VPL; editor and the second subdivides the editor window into two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor. then you can edit and turn back to source code editor, where the changes made in the VPL; editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor at a document containing & PHP; a small green symbol shows the default of & PHP; it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor. to edit & PHP; there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first one except that the changes are visible both in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor and the cursor in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor is running in sync. pressing F9 activates the active cursor from one window to the other, maintaining the position in the document.</seg>

After selecting VPL; -View, you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation can be set automatically: a small span for fast hosts and a large span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Assuming you want to change the title of the website, it is possible to choose tools document properties. this allows editing invisible tags when working with the VPL; Editor. the document properties dialog will also be called as soon as a new document is created with the VPL; editor. this can change the following:</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. why so & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see exactly what changed within those lines. and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a little nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could show differences within one line and changes to white signs. later, any number of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and paste it into one of the comparison windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the same and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a fully-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two persons work independently on one piece of code and make changes. the merge editor among the differences windows allows to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; when merging the folder:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of current color monitors. if you frequently have to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabs are displayed visible. if rows only differ in a certain number of white characters, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more trouble if someone changes indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal and the other one is different in one line, then the color indicates which file is different.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but are in different folders, then you can ease the typing work by just writing the filename of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 -o target folder kdiff3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 folder 2 folder 3 -o target folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The Open dialog allows manual typing of filenames, selecting the file browser (file...) or selecting a last opened file from the drop-down list. the opening dialog tells your selection and displays it again next time. you don't need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of the differences will be done with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">By selecting a folder, you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the merge or merge of folders will be initiated. if for A a file is selected, for B and C, however, a folder, then used & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merging is enabled, the input field becomes active for the target and can be edited. however, it is not absolutely necessary to immediately set an output file. you can also do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Settings button opens a dialog with Settings. here, you can set options before starting to merge / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts then immediately. in opening dialog, you do not need to select files, you can close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What is the idea behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you only need to create two corresponding files, upload them to & kdiff3; then you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: at the moment, you can't exclude anything from & kdiff3; only dropping text into a comparison window will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program than cut and paste (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Each info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, leave the mouse over the line for a while.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these default settings can be changed using the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, you can see the color, which file differs. if both files differentiate, the default color is red for it. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. this is in the next section (merge) well to see.</seg>
<seg id="2306">When differences are found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + +, for example, white signs are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in a few rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no rows. if the line break is enabled, the line is represented on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the reference windows) also has an info row with the text output:, the filename and [changes] if you have edited the result. usually, it contains text by automatic merging, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is downlighted!!! (use the Springe buttons to the next resolved / unsolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, each difference is also a conflict that needs to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows, the group belonging to the line will be selected in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes there is no other line left in the group by automatic merging or manual editing; this is only a placeholder in the event that you change your mind and maybe choose another source. this text does not appear in the final stored file, nor in a marking that you may copy and insert somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflicts; however, appears in the clipboard when you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources ignoring the options or ignoring C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, up, down, side up, start, end, Ctrl-start and Ctrl-end, Siw as you can also use it from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the output window, you can also use the other buttons for editing. with the Insert key, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns will synchronize the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the merge section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can skip to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous difference (Ctrl-picture to Move / Ctrl-Image Away) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the mark to the clipboard, you have to press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). if enabled, you automatically copy whatever you mark, automatically copy it to the clipboard and skip the manual copying. however, be careful with this option because you may overwrite the contents of the clipboard accidentally.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use carriage return + newline\\ r\. Kdiff3 does not keep the line end of the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not with binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of last used files will be automatically saved when you exit and will be restored at the next start. (menu Settings - &gt; Kdiff3 set up...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">Activating this option displays differences in italic script. if the selected font does not support this representation, nothing happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be rendered astert.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is enabled, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the Tab key. otherwise, a tabulator character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When pressing Enter or Return, the indentation of the previous line will be used automatically for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is enabled, each selection is automatically copied to the clipboard. the manual copying to the clipboard is no longer necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line type you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used choice on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, & kdiff3 first to find all the fully identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step, white signs are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a carriage return character '\\ r' and a newline '\' at the end of a line, while others only store a newline\ '. usually ignore & kdiff3; the car return label, but then files with different sizes in page-by-page comparison will look identical, although they are different. while merging, this option must be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the default setting, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated signs ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. as a result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated as white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">This option is disabled in default. changes in comments will be treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Search for even smaller differences. the option is activated by default. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slow with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the automatic jump mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next unresolved conflict continues.</seg>
<seg id="2335">This is useful when white characters are less important in many files. if you need this only from time to time, then use the Select A / B / C functions for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that automatic selection also applies to conflicts in numbers or comments when options ignore numbers or ignore C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are handled in the chapter for scanning folders and executing a merge. for details, see documentation for directory comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already an older version exists, the original version will be appended to the suffix .orig. if such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Changes the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the currently running program. you must & kdiff3; quit and restart to make the change active. (this option is not available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally via the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set for each entry separately. if you activate this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Over the drop-down boxes for encoding appears a short notice what the local encoding is. (this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted. since coding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different encoding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding is to be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files could be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of preprocessing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress highlighting of changes in white characters in text or overview columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments when options ignore numbers or ignore C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are shown in a color-coded overview column. but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you'd like to use the space available on the screen for long lines. just skip the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you look at the differences and then decide to merge the files together. a simple click starts the merge and uses the filename of the last source file as default name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart merge, then the name of the last used output file will be maintained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own pre-processor that exactly meets your requirements. you can use this function for example to cut out disruptive parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command is specified (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this preprocessing command.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind this is to provide the user with more flexibility when setting up the diff-results. however, an external program is required, and most users don't want to program it by themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for newlines to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\) /\\\\ 1 / 'This. * is an ergo expression that matches any string and in this context all characters are listed in one line.\\ 1 in the creation string is related to the found text in uppercase.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated character strings (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). all follow the same pattern $keyword-generated text $. now, a pre-processing command for line reconciliation is required: SED's /\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you may start to understand it and maybe you may even like these regular expressions. you are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in Kdiff3. but it is good as an example for another pre-processing command for line aberrs. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each hit is replaced by nothing, so quasi erased.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the replacements from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead, you can also use something else such as perl -p -e's / regexp / Regexp / Regexp / Regexp / Regexp / Regexp / Regexp / Delete / SCHALTER 'However perl only needs (and) without the preceding'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor are retained for display and merging. further operations only change the data that the newline algorythmus looks like.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when using a normal preprocessor, the newline preprocessor will see the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers in a folder need to edit a lot of files. for this reason, you can compare and merge entire folders recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for each object to merge; you can adjust the proposal before starting,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate merging and displays the simulated changes without actually performing them,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging individual files. you just need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are merged, folder 1 will be used as a base. if no target folder was specified, use & kdiff3; folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically, not merging. to start merging, you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (see more details.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, you will find a small message window about current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folders, only the files that were compared to that time are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is finished, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded up. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / -, or double clicking on the object or by using the arrow keys for left / right.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double-click on a file, the comparison window will start and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the Details window to the selected object. in such a case the merge action cannot be automatically selected. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed about any problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the picture above, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In identical entries, however, the color is identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical when their entire content is identical. then, folders also have the same color. with folders, the age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirtydiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf, which is only green, then yellow and later when it is old, becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical but not A: copy A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same type of file (e.g. if A is a folder and B): error: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, the merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same type of file (e.g. if A is a folder and B): error: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, the merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The synchronization mode is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified, and if the option is synchronized to directories. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action out so that both folders are identical. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but are not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible filename for the output file only B; copied directly after the merge & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are merged, and the option New file instead of merging (unsafe) is enabled, then explores & kdiff3; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy. if the files are different, but the date is identical. if such errors are not removed, the merge of the folder cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While merging, one file is processed after the other. it displays the status column when the merge succeeds, and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurs. if the merge is complete, you should make a final check and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">When in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full analysis, KDiff3 will display additional columns. these contain the number of unresolved, deleted, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (File or Odner), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the merge actions (also in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have not specified a destination folder, then C will be used as the target in the Three-Folder-merge mode, B is chosen as the target, and A and / or B are used as the target when synchronizing.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check that all entries that should be in the destination folder will also be displayed in the folder structure. there are some options that may be skipped in the folder structure. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select the directory merge and continue in the list menu or press F7 (the keyboard shortcut). to only merge the current entry: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If invalid combination actions still exist by conflicting file types, a message appears that indicates erroneous elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog box appears with the options through, Simulate and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simuate if you would like to see what would happen without actually making any changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; execute specific actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merging a single file), a merge window opens (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are finished with a file, select another directory merge, continue or press F7. if you haven't yet saved it, a corresponding dialog appears. then you will execute & kdiff3; its work continues with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If you encounter a bug, a message and detailed status information will appear. at the end of the list, you will see some error messages that will help you eliminate the cause of the problem. if you continue merging (F7 key), you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in a different way before you continue merging.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged together, you notice & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and will not merge them again at the later compilation of all entries. even if the merge has been skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered finished. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Menu Settings - &gt; Kdiff3 set up...) now has a section called Folder merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. multiple patterns can be entered. separate the patterns with a semicolon;. valid wildcards: '*' and '?'. (eg * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders do not have to match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many self-formatted files are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this file can be set with a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a hidden attribute. in other file systems, a preceding dot indicates a file as hidden. this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">For links to files: if the option is switched off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is disabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">When the option is switched off, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is switched on, the links will be treated like normal folders and recursively searched. (note that & kdiff3; does not check for possible recursions. a link to a folder that contains a link on itself would lead to an infinite loop and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is disabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns. (the number of resolved, unsolved, non- white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files containing no text. (enter a corresponding anti-sample.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders through a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the modified date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security. please use caution. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the date of change. there is no real comparison. the files are considered identical when they are equal. this can be useful, for example, when the change date has been lost. please use caution. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Enable synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected so that both folders are identical. also the results of merging files are saved in both folders. this option is disabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging the copy of the newer file will be suggested as an action. (this is considered unsafe because the knowledge is provided that the other file has not been modified.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, the original version will be renamed and will get the .orig. If an old backup file with the .orig extension already exists, it will be deleted without further backup. this also affects the normal merging of single files, not just the merging of entire folders. this option is enabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">You can move the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want it, you can split the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want it, you can split the menu option & Text window to main window in the window menu and switch between the two views using a change between the directory & text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge. to do this, use the current file merging from the merge menu. to do this, use the current file merging from the merge menu. to do this, use the current file merging from the merge menu.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost when you re-read the directory: directory -Menu: read new</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open, located on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. you should consider a few things:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. contain. that is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, Space &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes through the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows. then a file is always accepted as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or modification dates. therefore, the permissions or modification date deviate from the original. (note the option Confidential of Size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently the difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP first always starts the built-in difference viewer. to start Kdiff3, press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In Kdiff3Part display from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally needed & kdiff3; two complete input files. if it is applied as a part, & kdiff3; assuming that the input file is a patch file in unified format. then removes the name of the original file from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then start & kdiff3; the patch program to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the konqueror, you can click on a patch file and select PrePreview into - KDiff3Part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exist. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the creation of the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kdiff3; as a part, it supports only comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now it's compact) already exist. furthermore, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff3 from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a very long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who went this way or would like to go this way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from the sources and probably didn't tell the configure script the correct prefix to KDE. in the default configure configure in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated as identical first; however, if only a non-white character is different, the line will be treated as not identical.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notices for every difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. this is necessary to easily resolve a conflict by clicking in the source code and selecting the A / B / C button. however, this important information is lost when the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort required was so far too large. you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to process larger amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly bored; No src is left; and the text can't be deleted. what does that mean and how can that be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses already many colors to highlight differences. even more highlighting would be confusing and misses the purpose. please use another editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information about how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of recent changes can be found under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the ChangeLog file in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde, use the following command in the base folder of the & ks3; -distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir will specify the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and autoconf, you should not have any problems with compiling. if difficulties occur, please report to the & kde; -Mailing lists of them.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift-Delete) copies to clipboard and deletes the selected text. paste (Ctrl-V or Shift-Paste) inserts the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position or replaces the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Show only differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, after changes to these options, you must re-read the folder with the Update function.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries that show differences. this also causes identical files to not be copied to the destination folder when merging. if the target folder doesn't already contain these files, they will be missing after merging. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">If you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be appended to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the lines are already present, they will be removed when clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. differences in single characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; displays a thumbnail of all virtual desktops. it is quite handy to see the running programs on working surfaces, change their size, end them or postpone them. this works both inside a desktop as well as several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual desktops as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and on the other.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; the movement is possible in both a desktop and on other working surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & Kpager; clicked, the context menu has only the two entries to set up pager... and exit. if however on an application inside & Kpager; clicked, the icon and name of the application as well as the Minimize, Maximize, On Desktop and Finish. the commands create the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows can be moved within the & Kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">If this field is enabled, the name of the virtual desktops will be displayed in the & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field allows the & Kpager to display the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is enabled together with name, the names are provided with folder numbers, & eg; 1. desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is enabled, the background of each desktop will also be displayed as background in the & Kpager; displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is enabled, the current programs will be displayed as small windows in the & Kpager; otherwise, only empty spaces are displayed to allow them to be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the windows with their standard icon and pixmap displays a small view of the actual program window. note: pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; -main window can be determined: classically & Kpager; in a 2xN raster appear, as from pager applications in some other Windows managers; horizontal, all virtual desktops appear horizontal and vertical in a vertical range, which is very good for displaying sideways on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, display and move the windows as symbols or with their contents. in addition, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click inside & Kpager; and then select switch set up... allows the dialog to appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vice versa. if you do not have any write permission for the file, you must log in as user root or turn to your system administrator.</seg>
<seg id="2467">As & Kpager; part of the package kdebase, you need a functioning installation of the KDE base packages.</seg>

<seg id="2480">& kmag; is a screen loupe. you can use & edit a part of the screen as if you read a magnifying glass for the print or the exact viewing of a photograph. this application is interesting for different users: this includes artists, web designers and people with visual impairment.</seg>
<seg id="2481">& kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly updated to include new features. it is optimized for use on high performance computers.</seg>
<seg id="2482">When you start & edit, a window appears as shown above. the main window of & kmag; displays the enlarged area of the screen. in the following, this window is called a magnification window. the image that is displayed in the magnification window is an enlarged area of the screen and is described as a selection window in the following.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default setting, you can & k the area around the mouse cursor as a moving magnifier. alternatively, you can & k; this causes a selected screen area to be displayed in the magnification window (selection window mode) or the environment of the mouse pointer at the edge of the screen (eg; at the left edge of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged window, select the cursor position. please note that & kmag; currently it is not able to see the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the default node; / Qt; mouse cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the selection window mode, you can adjust the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse cursor in the magnification window and keep the left mouse button pressed, so you can capture and move the contents of the magnification window. this also works with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you additionally press the & Shift key, press or the & MMB; use, you can move the selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">With this combination you can change the size of the selection window. note that the upper left corner of the drop-down window remains fixed and only the lower right corner is to move.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& kmag; has a lot of functions. you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer, save it into a file, copy it to the clipboard (to insert it later into other applications), rotate the image and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Start or stop the display. stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the update rate (Very low, Gering, Medium, High, Highly high). the higher the update rate, the more CPU time is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In this mode, a selection window is displayed. the selected area is displayed in a window.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulate a mouse click once the mouse-cursor continues for a while at the same position. it is thought to help people who suffer from the repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and each mouse click causes pain.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without any pain. unfortunately, pain caused by the use of your computer may also cause pain. if you suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer, you should consult a doctor if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To clear it once more: even though & kmousetool; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic aids, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click once you pause the motion briefly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">Move the mouse, wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button. in this way you can drag the mouse with pressed mouse button. this allows you to drag the mouse with pressed mouse button. the intelligent shifting requires a little exercise, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must be stored after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool, a click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Smart Verses is enabled, the time of rotation (1 / 10 s) is activated. here the time is set, the & kmousetool; after pressing the mouse button, wait before releasing the mouse button again if there is no moving of the mouse in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="2505">This moves will be saved in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool; the first time it is started, but can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound is delayed, you can & kde; move to shorten the response time. go to Sound & Multimedia, select Sound System and here the Rider General. there is a slider sound buffer that will set you to a lower value to shorten response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool is started; at each start of & kde; this function is currently only available under & kde; available. for GNOME or other window environments please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically there.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Set all settings to the values set when you open the dialog. if you already press the Apply button, the settings will be reset to the stand after the last press.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first, use the default settings. in particular, the smart move should be switched off first. if you then get used to the automatic mouse click, you can later move the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it might need the response times of & kde; to decrease with sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that does not show a link does not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse clicks you should clean your mouse. this is usually pretty simple. the trick is that you don't just clean the mouse, but also the rollers that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you need to take the mouse out of it. as this happens, mouse to mouse is different. however, it should be clear when you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you'd have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used. you can scrape the dirt and dirt easily with a flat blade or finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts the execution of the kmousetool; if you are using the smart move in this case, this means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer stop by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool, using another window manager and postpone a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can carry out a mouse click. this will reset the status of & kmousetool, and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and place the cursor in another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor where you want to have it. but leave the mouse on a neutral zone of the desktop, if you want to make a keyboard input. thus, accidental moving of the mouse cursor can cause unintentional reactions. secure zones for the mouse cursor are & eg; the grey areas around the toolbars and menus and the headlines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with intelligent shifting, but I don't manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent move is an advanced feature of & kmousetool, and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very probably possible to copy text, copy it to the clipboard, or to execute any other action you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. here are some advice:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move if you just start using it & kmousetool; instead, select text like this: at one end of the text area, select a mouse click and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this means that every time the mouse button is played, the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when the move time starts when intelligent. later you can also use the intelligent shift without the audible click of the mouse. however, it requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & kmousetool, the Xtest extension for & X windows needs to be installed. this should be the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and is correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointer stops. this program is designed for people who suffer from RSI syndrome and who are causing pain.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured in such a way that it waits for a certain time to start a Drag process before releasing the mouse button. in this way, the drag and drop can be done with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced skills of & ktops; for normal work with & ktops; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In filters, text is processed before being sent to the speech-dispatcher. they are useful for improving the pronunciation to replace false spoken words or abbreviations, to select a suitable language and speaker, or to circumvent certain deficiencies of speech synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the way filters work, it is important to know how the "speech-patcher" program works with a text. & ktts; distinguishes four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The display of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and keeps those orders. if the output of the screen readers is pre-read, the retained jobs will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor is subject to hot. a warning has precedence and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after issuing the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News has the next highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you & eg; read a long text on a website, you can with & kmouth; someone who just enters the room. & kde; -notifications are also news.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each order you initiate from the card order is a text order. KSayit is an example of an application that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that do not have any particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queues, except the output of Screen Readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, during & tts; just one read, this issue will stop and terminate.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; -messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter edit the text and pass it to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future, there can be even further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Text boxes replace parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced are delivered either as words or as regular expressions. & ktops; is delivered with pre-defined string set filters that allow the creation of chat-emoticons such as: -) by text or for reformatting messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a more understandable form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; -Transforms use an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from one format to another format. includes some XSLT files for the translation of & XHTML; in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With speaker selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to & ktons; sent to a speaker. for example, if you have set a female voice on the card tab Speaker, you can read text from KDE news about it. read it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has adjustable rules after which it is applied for voice output. if the filter detects that its rules do not apply, it continues to pass the text to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; -notification to & ktops; sent, it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the page below. processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>

<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter and the following setup dialogs are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For setting label assertion filters you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern. if these patterns are found in the text, the text will be replaced with the corresponding replacement text. case-sensitive case is not observed when comparing.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name as you like, it only needs to be distinguished from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the match column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Erbet. the list is executed in the displayed order from top to bottom.</seg>

<seg id="2677">The "speech-Dispatcher" program uses adaptable module architecture for voice synthesizers. if you would like to extend it to use another synthesizer, please contact the developer team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The program xsltproc is used for the support of SSML and for the & XML; conversion filter but is not absolutely necessary. Debian users can install xsltproc with the command apt-get install xsltproc.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile, compile, you need a current development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or newer), including packages kdelibs and development files for the program "speech-Dispatcher."</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have downloaded the source code from & ktops, from the source code archive for kdebar or downloaded the tarball created every night, you can compile and install the program using the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before using & ktops, make sure you use the speech synthesizer in your speech synthesizer at first. to do this, you can use the spd-conf shell script.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktops; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of & ktops; the ttmsgr utility is to be developed in such a way that the creation of speech tools is directly possible and the script spd-conf is no longer required.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is broken into individual sets. the user can reverse the set or paragraph style, repeat, pause, or cancel the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">For example, if you specify a speaker whose language is female and whose sex is female, it will be used, otherwise the best appropriate speaker will be used. if you want to know more about how & ktops, select a speaker, look in.</seg>
<seg id="2685">If you click Add tab on the tab card and add a speaker to the list or click Edit, the card card speaker setup will display. as an example, the setup of the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below. for details on the modules, please refer to.</seg>

<seg id="2687">Select the text encoding for text handed to the festival. if voices, the ktops, are known, this setting is done automatically. in general, Western languages use ISO 8859-1, Eastern languages such as czech or Slovakian use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these slider controls, you adjust the volume, speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you cannot select a number of knobs and display this grey, the voice you have selected doesn't let you select these settings.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like MultiSyn voices need several seconds to load multiple seconds due to their size. if you select this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD so that (with greater memory consumption) the first set is synthesized more quickly.</seg>

<seg id="2703">On this map, you can set up specific actions that will always be executed when the text assignment is interrupted by a higher priority message. & ktts; processes four types of voice orders:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The display of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders. after the output of the screen readers is read, the retained jobs are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next highest priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor is subject to hot. a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text.</seg>
<seg id="2706">News have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that speaks news. if you are & eg; just read a long text on a website, you can with & kmouth; nevertheless someone who is just entering the room.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to highlight text for voice output. this standard contains stamps for controlling voices, speech speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch. also marks for controlling the pronunciation for example abbreviations. SSML is a part of VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supported & ktops; SSML only partially and only in the basic functions. the following restrictions are present:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the rab _ diphone voice (british male), since this is the standard voice that uses the festival in the output of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog is not set to 1001;%, the SSML text is usually spoken very monotonously.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and punctuation filter (SDB filter). SBDs subdivide text into individual sets. this allows you to start faster with the read when only the first set needs to be synthesized, not the entire text order.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the set of punctuation filters. at the first start of & ktops, a set of propositional filters is set up automatically. you can change its settings or add further set-limits filters, but beginners will get rid of them.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn how to set up the speaker selection by selecting it. select orders, which speaker & tts; select orders from the box menu, change some properties and check how the selection of the speaker is changed. of course, you need to have more than one speaker installed, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktops; then start faster with the read, because only the first sentence has to be processed and not the whole block of text, which can take a long time,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can pause or cancel text orders on the card card, even if the voice synthesizer doesn't support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the regular punctuation filter is set up automatically when you start ktmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, only removed. do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Conformance Recognition filters compare text with a regular expression for propositional texts and add a tabulator character (decimal code 8) at the set limits (tabulator characters are automatically removed from the text in front of the filter).</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; -messages (knotify), warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal Record identifier filter from mistake, you can insert it again by loading the standard _ sbdrc file contained in the ktops;</seg>
<seg id="2736">You can override the subscriber settings for the application on the box menu. the card is displayed when</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the default speaker (the top speaker on the tab Speaker). in other words, no speaker properties are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most appropriate speaker that has all the features of a set-up speaker. if you do not delete or edit the speaker settings, select & ktops; otherwise select & ktops; select the speaker closest to the originally set characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the desired speaker here. if this property does not play a role, do not enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Select this check box if the property should have precedence over other properties. you can also set multiple marks here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in the understanding of the output, it is always treated as the primary property. you will rarely use this property. the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language is available if you know that a particular application sends text in a different language than the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the properties in the speaker area closest to the following, click the standard speaker button and then use speaker which is closest to the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 is for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify a job number. (without the order number the input 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Ktmgr crashes immediately when it is started. I have compiled debug support, but I do not get traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crashing and ktops; it is finished. you probably have to register GStreamer. if the problem is not solved by this, you may need a non-compatible version of GStreamer. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output via ALSA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application. if I receive a text order, it freezes. a. on the & Console; appears a message stating: Unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">There is a problem on your system that conflicts occur at ALSA, which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. please refer to the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the Internet. I installed it and can use it in festival, but ktmgr shows this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add the new voice in the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / ktale d / festivalint / vocal. if this is successful, please send a patch along with the & URL; on which you have found the voice to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the audio card audio there is a setting speed. in order for this to work, the program must be installed sox and be discoverable via the environment variable PATH. some synthesize moduls such as Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed even on the card for subscriber devices. depending on the selected voice, this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the speech speed are ignored when & ktops; & HTML; read. (this is because the HTML is converted to SSML.) Disable either the filter for the conversion of & html; (see) or, if you are very brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -according to the SSML-performerfilter, and set up the speech speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't make it that websites are read with a female voice. I have set up a female festival speaker, but respectts; reads the web pages with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta, the tag Sable GENDER does not seem to work. to make festival no errors, the xsl file rejects the GENDER tags for converting SSML to Sbut the GENDER tags. the same applies to the VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added an own label assertion filter and now I can go in & ktops; no more set-up or going back. on the card turner jobs is displayed, the order consists only of one sentence. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">Punctuation marks (point, question mark, exclamation mark, comma and semicolon) are not allowed to filter out. instead, use a filter for character limit detection for these characters.</seg>
<seg id="2757">ALSA (Advanced & Linux; Sound Architecture). ALSA is on most systems with & Linux; already installed. (www.alsa-project.org)</seg>
<seg id="2758">GStreamer in version 0.8.7 or newer. note: make sure that the GStreamer modules are registered by using GStreamer in & ktops. (HTTP: / / gstreamer.freedesktop.org)</seg>

<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizers whose source code is open. the quality of the voices is generally good and multiple voices and languages are supported.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You need to install at least one language. help find help in the instructions provided with the festival. if you want to read web pages, you must install the (male) voice rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices you need to compile an additional module, so you need the source code of the festival. the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This voice presupposes Festival 1.95 beta or later. the voice is still in an early stage of development. if you set up the software in festival / lib / vocals / russian /. if you set up the Russian voices, you need to enter the voices of MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone. select a cyrillic (8-bit) encoding as for example coi8-R.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; which allows management of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a uniform, integrated interface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be accessed by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package has been designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; create a simple interface for the user:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module Network Setting is displayed in the & kcontrolcenter; the network settings module (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network Network Setting in & KMenu;</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to allow & knetworkconf; the device at all displays and allows setting of network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices will be installed and installed. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by customizing the following files according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network settings module is loaded when the Network Setting option is selected in the & kcontrolcenter; index. when starting the network settings, this attempts to automatically detect the system used on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be recognized, the dealer selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to choose which corresponds best to distribution and release status. by selecting the setting of non-re-questions, setting can be made permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. previously, all options are displayed gray, meaning the settings can only be viewed, changing is not possible. in system management mode, you can enter the system management mode at the right bottom of the module by clicking on the system management mode. it is required to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. it is divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. from the network interfaces, the following tasks can be performed:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface... in the dialog Device setup.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the selection Automatically, the TCP / IP settings are taken from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings are executed for the system at the same time with the start of the system services. the DHCP- or BOOTP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at every system start, therefore no further setting is required. in the selective list, either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection Manuell, without dhcp or BOOTP the TCP / IP configuration can be made. in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this option is selected, the system initializes the network interface during boot. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog will be shown as the characteristics of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. ping in the console, you can see if the address is already in use. in case of doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or disabled, depending on their needs. switching on an outdated network device is enabled by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface.</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or disabled, depending on their needs. disable an activated network device by selecting from the list and deactivating interface....</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the host's IP address in the local subnet which conveys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface must be selected to the network where the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A host with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the host requests http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS will trigger this name to an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution part of the name resolution machine allows you to easily manage this list. entries can be added, removed or changed. DNS records can be rearranged by selecting an entry or downgrading in the list with the knobs in or down in the priority list.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking on the Add... button from the batch machine to name resolution, a DNS server can be added. it will display the New Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry will be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">"" "from the group" "" "Calculator" "" "group choose one entry and then click the Edit button." ""</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of name-known hosts describes the hostname-to-IP address-reference for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used during boot, if no DNS servers are available. in small, closed networks, it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Usually the list contains some known hosts some entries, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses support. this version of IP which is still in the test is to replace version 4 in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the well-known computer and click Add... Add the New Alias dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the well-known computer and click the Add button. if the well-known computer has multiple alias names, press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a named calculator from the list and select Edit... Edit the dialog you want to edit.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be performed one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the network settings are not immediately effective in the system. to activate the changes, must be set in a & console; the following command must be set.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it suffices when & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the precompiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with a graphical interface like a package or the installation tool of its distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; not, but in addition, the development packages are needed with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only to experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile and compile. the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology is given, and in the second section, all configuration files are discussed by & knetworkconf.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about the integration of the PC is conveyed into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently being run with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv6 has never found widespread dissemination. IPv6 is expected to continue in the near future. therefore, this description is currently focusing on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is to be assigned. in foreign networks, at the & eg; the network administrator is the contact person who has a valid IP address or, if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address cannot be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up a separate small (home) network, the IP address should be chosen from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, therefore any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be made possible by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses are usually used in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special purposes, i.e. 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called default route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = your own computer).</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to its own so-called loopback interface that works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">This section contains the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf, and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connection, so it is not surprising if there is a different content than specified in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another stand as expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar, which also provided dds2tar for quick, selective packing. the second purpose was to answer a question my wife provided: how much longer does it take to secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be mounted by & kdat; this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; trains the tape back and reads the prestressing information of the tape. detects & kdat; don't recognize the pretension on the tape, you will be asked if the tape should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects & kdat; the prefix, searches for the appropriate index on your disk. if it cannot be found, you will be asked if the index index should be regenerated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">When everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was integrated. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched by flaps of the entry for the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; indicates by changing the symbol for the tape that the integration for the tape has been solved and displays a corresponding message in the status bar. the band can now be ejected without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape can be used by & kdat; it must be formatted by & kdat;</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band type must be formatted before you can be used to store data. if your tape drive requires formatting a tape before use, this must happen before you can be formatted by the tape of & kdat; floppy disk drives usually require formatting of the tape, but DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and capacity, it continues with the format of the tape. all data on the tape is lost! after completion of the formatting process, the band is automatically mounted and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you need to select the files to be secured. this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select Save...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been initiated, the dialog opens for backup. in this dialog, you can once again check the selected files and change the backup settings.</seg>
<seg id="2909">When you confirm the settings dialog, the dialog appears. the dialog displays the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. only the selected file or folder will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click on one of the archives and select the menu entry Verify....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test process has been started, the dialog for Verification will appear. in this dialog, you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for the check.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for the check, the dialog appears to Verify. this dialog displays the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can initiate restore, the files you want to restore must be selected. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive. only the selected file or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the restore process has been started, the dialog for Recovery will appear. in this dialog, you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the restoration settings, the Restore dialog appears. this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recreate the index file with the contents of the tape. this process will delete all existing index files for this band. you can create the index in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder where the backup is to take place. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all files listed in backup files, only the files located in the same file system will be backed up, such as the folder. folders that are located on other filesystems can be registered separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar independently from the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">To establish which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only files that have changed since then are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Delete the snapshot file before calling tar. this will cause all files to be backed up and create a new snapshot file for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; and lt; files were not fully implemented at the time the documentation was created.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set the settings via the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (normally / dev / tape). this path must point to the non-reunwinding variant of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, it transmits & kdat; before the tape is inserted, the command is mapped to the drive. for some drives, this is necessary before read or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is switched on, try & kdat; to block the discard from the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work for all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, the tape will automatically be dismounted when uninstalling & kdat; do not use this option for floppy streams.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, try & kdat; not all drives support variable block sizes. not all drives support variable block sizes. whether this setting is active or not, you must & kdat; in any case tell the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">When & kdat; a band formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">The format of this string is the name: seconds, where the name is the complete name of the system on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time the tape has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band id is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives that can be used directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup band. this symbol is only active when a tape is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; ist ein & kde; -Viewer for system logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to receive information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files. in addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users quick access for example on information about issues that appear on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the log files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to receive information about your system or where the system places the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog allows experienced users to quickly access information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore, try to provide some advanced features that can be used to filter and evaluate the log files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">The current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. this includes:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the Syslog server format, and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog provides functions with which the individual protocol lines of a log file can be easily filtered and sorted. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After startup, try & ksystemlog; first, open the most important log file of the system - the system log. if it is not displayed to you, you have & ksystemlog; very likely not with system administrator privileges. the log files are usually found under Linux in the / var / log directory, for which normal users usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criterion or input string. the list of the log lines will now be changed automatically so that only the log lines that match the selected filter will be displayed. in the default setting, the selector contains the entry in addition to the filter. then a log line will only be displayed when the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can of course select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term is then matched only with the entries in the selected column. for example, select the process column in the protocol file system log, and also enter the name of a process in the filter bar, so show you & ksystemlog; all log lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. log lines of level errors are displayed with a more conspicuous color than minutes lines of level indication. the color presentation of minutes lines can be disabled setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show only certain process (for example in the system log or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. for example, this can be useful if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the samba server. in this case use filter strip.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the option to new lines in the main window context menu to display all new protocol lines added.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows you to display multiple protocol files in separate sub-windows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub-windows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log in the menu to view the display.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org Dort you will find further up-to-date information on the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>

<seg id="2956">Welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init quickly becomes the standard for the control of the program start when booting the system in & Linux; this is because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I won't go into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binary file is located under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and reformatting.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for each system service you want to start when you run the system or change to another running level. system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc. system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls are part of rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be located under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file even if you don't have much use for it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a serial port on boot.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches for init at different places and starts the first one to find.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following in the beginning area:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the preset Runlevel 3 is 3. if you want to change this, you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. be very careful if you have made changes to the inittab.</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder there are no right files. instead, each entry here is a shortcut to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts manually on the command line like this:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it includes a K, the script will be invoked with the argument stop. if it includes an S, the script will be invoked with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have & eg; a server-runlevel, which can only run httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; I could also have a user-run-level, the & kdm;, network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not tell trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runways to start it at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between runtime or change the position within one level by pulling it somewhere else. this will be removed from its original Runlevel (or its position). this will only happen if they extract an entry from the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved if you drag them into a new area. to only copy them to a new Runlevel, you have to explicitly select from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste it into the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you will need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: at present there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the Tabulator key to activate the different work areas (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another round-level, move it into the clipboard with cut-out (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired Runlevel with Insert (using Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To manually change the sorting number or name of an entry, press the Enter key to change the Properties dialog. use the Tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before running.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if available. otherwise, they are recovered from & ksysv; recovered. changes to presets are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard running levelns. and now the machine restarts constantly. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input key to start in the single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services provided with & ksysv; for execution under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc available only in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions is simplifying the configuration for the proprietary configuration programs of these distributions but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution, please check if all configuration files are available that are required by the respective system service (and also whether they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) simply end without a message if their configuration files are not present or incorrect.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of the & Linux; runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, may even be different from version to version. if you use a different distribution, please send me information about the runlevel, so that it can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation is based on & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To begin with & kuser; to begin, it is sufficient to read the chapter adjustment of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After making changes you need to save it. either use the corresponding toolbar icon or the save entry in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two flashcards, the user group and the user group list. for editing, select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings. only if you have enabled space constraints (quota) for users, a card card will be created on which you can customize individual settings. other flashcards appear if Shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card card password management will appear if Shadow passwords, such as / etc / master.passwd, are installed as in BSD Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This flashcard only appears if space limitation (quota) is activated and initialized for at least one-in file system (recognizable by the file quotas user / quotas group on the file system). here, parameters can be changed for each user, whereby the space constraints are respectively in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system is selected using the file system file system with space limitation.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The map group informs about the group affiliation of the selected user. the default group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the Primary group field. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The Dialogue Properties of the Group contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the user or group menu or click the appropriate Add button of the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or group will work analogously.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can install the LILO boot manager, add, remove and modify the boot password, change time to boot from the standard operating system, add, remove, change operating systems, remove, modify, and more.</seg>
