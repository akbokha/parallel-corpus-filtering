although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012 , I would live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American authors and operated his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was primarily a journalist because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can Brief , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as a Jura student , uncovered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was as if that was the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only intensified .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose variety is so inviting that you can always be who you are , and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I had even written a very black@@ ened love letter about his great@@ ness .
then came Donald Tr@@ ump .
much was written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me , how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never keeps his mind behind the mountain , as one says so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague put it , and publicly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , the people responded to his statements and voted in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can prim@@ aries was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever reached .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ?
I couldn &apos;t reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters to the people I met in Phoenix during my time .
for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism programme , which receives people from all over the world , a deep dev@@ out person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
also , Tr@@ umps did not agree with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er .
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the Phoenix S@@ uns in the game .
also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , she fights the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
she still fits the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me and my colleagues with a lot of patience and grace to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love of America .
while Tr@@ ump took his way to the nominated repub@@ li@@ can presidential candidate they offered me a footh@@ old and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
it turned out , however , that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly wh@@ ites , gave the presi@@ dency to a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they either shared their rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to design@@ ate the tr@@ ump @-@ voters as ra@@ cists .
arran@@ ging people , one of my friends said , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , most of whom know , voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , they might say that they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comment@@ ates on the cruel decision to lift a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different from him .
this &quot; whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( O@@ B . ) : as much as &quot; rebellion against all other ethnic groups &quot; ; word play from white in all@@ usion to the white and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as the great Van Jones called , has killed just what America has made so great .
millions of people around the world value the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have , America welcomes everyone .
for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan whose history , as he himself says , would never be possible anywhere else in the world .
with the election Donald Tr@@ umps , however , there is a huge part of the White America &apos;s promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole notion of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
at a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd responded with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried and their voices became lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would anyone who is not like you , have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land for which his son was pleased sent him a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now tr@@ umps country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan could no longer find a place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

from the misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music through rub@@ b@@ ish
the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what did the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community have in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Paragu@@ a@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura together ?
that the music played at both places has not only changed the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is at the edge of a large land@@ fill site , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; an old colonial town , which is very popular among tourists , but worlds apart from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now La b@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music band ) plays in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , located in one of the poor@@ est province of Mexico , is known for its abuse of drugs and the violence of the gangs .
but this changed after a chance encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth thus offered a rare g@@ lim@@ mer of hope .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Noti@@ ci@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always arrive laugh@@ ingly and with shiny eyes and play in the hu@@ stle you learn day by day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga to play .
music from garbage
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village located practically at the top of the biggest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paraguay &apos;s capital - are based on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ conditioned instruments consisting of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers under the direction of Fa@@ vio Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez have begun to turn parts of waste into instruments .
instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , contra@@ b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums , all made out of the garbage .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin @-@ American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , from Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article from the Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez , a local econom@@ ist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , re@@ members :
first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in garbage . children didn &apos;t know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed when Fa@@ vio was shown something he had never seen before : a tr@@ ash produced by tr@@ ash .
today , there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments from re@@ processed material and is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary named &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance :
every year , the world generates about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish .
those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries demonstrate how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on international , practi@@ sed solutions for environmental problems .
the re@@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the joint use of content .
in West Africa , it was known then that this ship had already caught illegal fishing in the Liber@@ ian waters before it was investigating the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were accordingly upset about this and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this species on their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambique and the Seych@@ elles quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to hire one of their ports and refused to grant them a permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused to do anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior officer of the Ken@@ yan fish@@ eries authority . he is part of a team who discovered and persecuted the ship at his time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : he was not able to catch fish there .
in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , due to pil@@ la@@ ging fish stocks in the country .
the core of this initiative , which sec@@ ts criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal Fishing ) .
apart from Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that the Prime Minister had expelled from their waters at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries who are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and stand at each other where it comes to illegal fishing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this project offers F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , and therefore it is extremely difficult to detect . this makes illegal fishing a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
due to the deliber@@ ate violation of existing laws through which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the sn@@ ail emp@@ athy , with the information between individual countries , actions happen in real time , with trace@@ ability to F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communications platform .
there , the individual countries can exchange for example lists of existing licenses , news about suspi@@ cious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i also carefully monitors the activities of ships when they move on the open sea using satellite data .
this makes it possible for the authorities to identify ships fishing in forbidden areas - such as those that indicate that a ship charges its caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the involved vessels have a fishing licence , where they were on the road and possibly also whether they have a criminal law .
countries which are against illegal fishing may then refuse to accept such ships in their ports , which means that ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there is considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worth the money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , managing director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm who advoc@@ ates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue , which the eight members of the H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network are losing each year because of illegal fishermen who inv@@ ade East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries , which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from around the world .
their practices include , among others , actions such as sailing under false flag , fal@@ si@@ fied license documents , imag@@ inary names , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an un@@ interrupted control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You must@@ n &apos;t run my port &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; yet another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to Me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now , the closed front has been working .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 suspi@@ cious vessels .
it has uncovered criminal networks that spread fal@@ si@@ fied roy@@ alties in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has tra@@ cked and found fle@@ eing vessels .
F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i is able to share and maintain information on illegal fishing across great distances due to its co @-@ operation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authorities for comb@@ ating crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Ber@@ gh says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more accurately .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps detect the illegal vessels that would like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to cross , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO who also deals with fish@@ eries data and offers technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland therefore helps build a system that connects different levels of information . it is designed to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to find criminals with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations really influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , president of N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has jointly opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oce@@ ana Sea Protection Organisation : a platform that provides satellite data and displays the position of every single track@@ able vessel in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; coming together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to pool their resources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only det@@ ain criminals , but also deter them .
ships that used to fish previously without a license and had hardly any consequences , now know they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i are now seeing a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries sales since fishing boats buy more lic@@ ences .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i had helped Somalia to track down Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors on board found tra@@ w@@ l nets which were banned .
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have become a subject of study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 six countries have joined forces , called the West Africa Task Force . they too combat illegal fishing , according to the exact same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With certainty , the goal is to make even more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s latest member country Somalia was able to report its first big triumph : in October , there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship under the false flag . and not only did the ship travel without a license and were used tra@@ w@@ l nets which are now prohibited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 marked a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ber@@ gh says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a special collaborative working method for the protection of the oceans actually works in the whole world sea .

their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; rec@@ la@@ iming the country &quot;
the street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the im@@ pe@@ achment of President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

after the Venezu@@ el@@ an government rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on im@@ pe@@ achment , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country fell into empt@@ iness by gathering on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the refund of Venezuela ) both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found .
the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - among others in the Bar@@ inas low@@ land area , in the An@@ de@@ an regions MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a , in the centrally located Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o Bun@@ de@@ state and the Margar@@ ita Island in the Federal State of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country is deterior@@ ating continuously , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans through an acute lack of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition saw in the inauguration of the current President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro an opportunity for a fundamental change ; in the end , however , the holding of a new election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , co @-@ founder of Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis in which the inflation and violence rates are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum in favour of many is the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the prot@@ esters called Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ Ã¡@@ tica or MU@@ D ( for example : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined forces . in addition , a twelve @-@ hour strike on the following day and a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an Government seat , were to continue to block the referendum on im@@ pe@@ achment .
the call has been commented on Twitter as follows :
it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil fight and on 3 November all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the action programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Recovery of Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the images of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most frequently shared images shows a demonstr@@ ator calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wilt thou kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cried the Venezu@@ el@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter , pictures that talk about confron@@ tations , as well as reports of oppression and abuse .
especially large waves broke the news about police repression in the centrally located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there , the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves against the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government according to their own statement .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an state T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a don &apos;t wear coats because you could see something that many national Gu@@ ards don &apos;t have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic makes the round showing the amount of repression per day :
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the call for an im@@ pe@@ achment procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ ek &apos;s Media Lab@@ s :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ dado are claiming that 1 % of the signatures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your im@@ pe@@ achment !
on the road !
others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which , from its point of view , did little against the devastating economic crisis and would rather have occupied critical voices :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches always increase in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or going shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ Ã³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , who was published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , an Argent@@ inian news page .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to view the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of CÃ³r@@ doba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now spoke against his father as part of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial in the province of CÃ³r@@ doba .
in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship were investigated .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
starting with the burden of wearing the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the prison of La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the family secret for himself .
in the situation at that time I believed that it was okay .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child of 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer and a mur@@ derer .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a gendar@@ mer@@ maid . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in prison La Per@@ la .

but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who is accused of kidn@@ apping in 15@@ 8 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 year old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ us &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of the atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father .
his story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a path of redemption .
from sports hall to military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall with us . there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts .
they all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have friends with one of the ERP .
just keep in mind that they will not kid@@ nap you one day and I have to save you .
the ac@@ ron@@ ym ERP is for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Argent@@ ine Revolutionary Workers &apos; Party .
that &apos;s why he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall again . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me that I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so my father had raised me .
on the military base I had to anni@@ hil@@ ate papers belonging to the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda materials , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ When the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la , all in 1976 .
during the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible - stood .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small bag wrapped in a blanket and commanded me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ rack where the stolen items were turned off and stopped me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I jump@@ ed in and saw a couch where men were tor@@ tured .
she looked like a cot and metal feathers .
later I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who had just tied there .
they seldom un@@ le@@ ashed a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it with water and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was terrible ... like a dirty wind .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I recognized the smell right away and I realized that it is the smell of a body in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it possible that a person can do so much suffering to another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were ch@@ ained and tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he talked to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian also charged in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the background I saw a series of matt@@ resses , where naked people were lying with the face down - all were tied hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance , people cau@@ tioned sil@@ ently on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed I was seeing the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why do you look so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you get me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me about it at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero put together a man and killed him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to the survivors , the civilian Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , re@@ counts the student Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the head of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way on which the ab@@ duc@@ tions came here .
if you look at the map , you will see that they took approximately this route and then were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra , until the order from the top came that they should be reloc@@ ated .
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war boot@@ y &apos;
my father brought home all kinds of stolen things .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; war boot@@ y &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was myself in the army , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war boot@@ y is a bay@@ on@@ et or maybe military markings which you have fought with an enemy that you fought .

but when one goes into a house and ste@@ als the refrigerator , record player , clothing , paintings , money ... then this is not a war boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , was able to participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; And you who steal a car on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded in rage , struck me and scre@@ amed :
when you go so far , I will find you and kill yourself .
for this we don &apos;t need anyone else !
so my father was .
I have not a single good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of that time on which I wore a jacket and a tur@@ tle pul@@ lover from wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought home clothes .
at that time , the defence accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can burden me what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to testify .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of corp@@ ses is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &apos;
now that I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once children have children , one recognizes the value of a life .
one further develops and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , so , during the dictatorship , you executed people , but for what purpose the corp@@ ses disappear ?
why kid@@ nap children ?
one day , my father brought a girl home , whose mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I asked myself again and again : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
you could have just put them in jail .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why their corp@@ ses disappear ?
did these people not have families that could be handed over to their mortal remains ?
the disappearance of corp@@ ses is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that one can do to a human being .
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they took machinery to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course something always remains .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the idea of seeing my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I repro@@ ached him for all the atro@@ cities I had to witness because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked myself why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; they allegedly defended were actually good .
then I cried :
how can you tell me something like that ?
I &apos;ve seen you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he only replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , then show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 I issued the first display .
at last I realized that he was a criminal .
no one can reproach me that I have been prejudi@@ ced . I have finally testified against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest pending before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes : including severe , illegal de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 15@@ 8 cases ; torture in 15@@ 4 cases ; murder in 98 especially severe cases , torture followed by death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years old .

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the size of the judgment in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims in August .
43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced to life imprisonment in 28 cases and in nine cases sentences of between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ al claims .
eleven of the 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Perm : murder , torture and rape by officials .
all the defend@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military , former police and civilian employees .
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was ab@@ duc@@ ted together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the Swiss Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court judgement is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ inian organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represents the children of people who were murdered during the dictatorship or disappeared , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but the search for it took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government handed over the country where La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial site could be erected , which is now being run by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible car &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto , where you can extend your driver &apos;s license .
the photo was circul@@ ated in the social media .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can pro@@ long their driver &apos;s license , witnessed a very special mis@@ guided translation during the last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a sign , the Japanese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( kor@@ ean &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; is wrong@@ ly mistaken - but perhaps also with malicious intent and # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; translated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the false translation was read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has been shared multiple times in the social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also the one who drew attention to local newspapers .
the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , published in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to elderly people and unacceptable in an international city like Kyoto , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; designation ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the more appropriate , even gram@@ mati@@ cally correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture was ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that elderly people felt offen@@ ded by the inadequate correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; said the police .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News was a little more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the share of older drivers , which are involved nationwide in accidents , is a cause of concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 cases of sen@@ iors were caused in 2005 . this equ@@ ates to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has dropped , the share of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen during the same period .
the un@@ named repor@@ ter published comments on the light in the version of the article published on Yahoo , showing what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently are against older drivers :
the article on the translation error on Yahoo includes the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about not reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So bad is the translation not at all , right ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so common across Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true treasure tro@@ ve for this bizarre error in English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
to translate , you need two important abilities : passive language skills to understand the starting text and to use active language skills to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires the active command of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their mother tongue , who could make translations into English . this may be due to a lack of understanding of translation , cost reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers that learn Japanese .
some companies , who do not have foreign employees themselves , can still make translations within the company . then , the Japanese employee , whose knowledge of English is considered the best , is made a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the verb@@ s and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences created by machine translations show that this technique can &apos;t replace any human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic im@@ prints often ador@@ ning T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery . but by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more accurate translations .
the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations in the future .
Venezuela : to take protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the websites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV are no longer accessible .
other online broad@@ cast@@ ers have also recorded footage of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organized by opposition groups that oppose the government of Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .
the protests began in early April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the findings of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was cli@@ pped and recommended users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to access the Internet .
# C@@ ens@@ orship : activate your VPN .
it seems that the Venezu@@ el@@ an IS@@ Ps internet pages are locked again .
this is from the @ Vi@@ vo@@ playlist page .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media has been hes@@ it@@ ant in reporting about protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for T@@ elecommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national television channels , I registered again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
it is amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two more online channels . this also applies to the Internet site where the National Assembly communic@@ ates its sessions .
past investigations by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technology that uses DNS servers to answer requests for certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server responds poorly or refuses to request such a website .
we confirm a DNA lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third sealed channel , the broadcast was suspended on Thursday 6 April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera man El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who transmitted the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , was arrested .
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
eight hours later , he was released , and V@@ PI@@ Z returned to the show again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ ans more difficult to access multimedia reporting on current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to get an education
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today T@@ ina fights for the rights of children and collects testim@@ onies of other Cri@@ adi@@ tes who became victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a structural report published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying C@@ ows , deca@@ ying Schools &quot; ) edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house proudly spoke about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one who has become something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a has never been treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she started working as a cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . Cri@@ adi@@ ta means that in Paraguay there are more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money hands over their under@@ age son or their under@@ age daughter to another , rich family .
what is not mentioned , however , is that the children have to pay for countless days of house@@ work , which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this under a contract that cannot be lifted .
this practice , described as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations .
after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a number of years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ ta - especially young girls affected by the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of gratitude which is ino@@ cul@@ ated by the Cri@@ adi@@ ta guarantees in general silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , the family , who is their daughter in the belief that they are completing their education , can improve their position in society and &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; can be handed over to another family .
on the other hand , the family who takes the girl with her and justi@@ fies her exploitation with the faith that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and maybe even star@@ ved .
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will only be experienced many years later .
sometimes they never experience it .
in January 2016 , the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon occurred , which takes place in the hidden in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n was hospit@@ alized in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed signs of violent sho@@ cks . shortly thereafter she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military member Tom@@ Ã¡s F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o , who works as an official at the Population Register .
Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small village with just 3.000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
at the end of January 2016 , F@@ errei@@ ra arrived at Mar@@ Ã­n as long as she suffered le@@ thal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organisations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela attributed the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go to the death of the girl deeply rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they described the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest r@@ allies and called for &quot; no other Carolina &quot; to be in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compla@@ ined T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children without imp@@ unity .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organizations called for a spe@@ edy investigation into the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was their Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
if the case comes to court , the fall of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be direction @-@ breaking - for the first time in the history of Paraguay a fall of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to trial .
the Life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ ta are not only exploited as labour power , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , in which her father worked , had to register bankrupt@@ cy and her father lost his work .
their brothers now had to go all the way and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money .
but they all went to school .
only T@@ ina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
in the house of her employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
she had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time to learn .
she rose every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employer .
Fri@@ days , for example , cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn .
the sooner she finished learning , the more free time she had .
but also this time was limited because they had to do dinner for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but didn &apos;t get too much food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge , &quot; she recalls .
the library was well @-@ equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ izer of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
at some evenings the host Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced him to stand next to him and read editorial from opposition papers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince them not to believe in the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
he kept her intellig@@ ently , but did not enter@@ tain her . &quot; the host had found someone who listened while he talked about politics , &quot; she says .
&quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they thought I would like to learn &quot; bad habits &quot; again . so they thought that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ , would speak again at home their native language Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ .
their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible .
but she was completely clear that she had paid for everything she got from them , with her hard work .
also in school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing about which is almost never talked about is mo@@ b@@ bing and the ch@@ ic@@ anes that Cri@@ adi@@ ta are exposed to when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anybody to my home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I was not part of any group .

the Society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , where you can share vac@@ ancies for cleaning staff and children in Paraguay .
the board administrator is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ Ã³n district .
hello ! I am looking for a little companion for my little daughter , who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please report to you .
starting from Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the display received five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the place Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her phone number .
another woman , who also came out of Ã@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the hear@@ tland who wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the author of the ad switched on again :
dear friends , I have found one . I look if it works with her .
thank you , I am writing again if something is .
the business was completed .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ adi@@ ta , Â¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ Ã¡n@@ do ?
( Cri@@ adi@@ ta , how long ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies from former Cri@@ adi@@ ta , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history we managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the history of Paraguay , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of the Guar@@ ani and their &quot; wives &quot; ) and the system of the cant@@ een ( in which the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors had to pay tribute and Spanish in@@ doctr@@ ination ) and the system of the Mens@@ ing ( where the workers were considered semi @-@ slaves ) and the system of bondage where they become light victims of abuse and exploitation .
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the display of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill dra@@ fts Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
picture of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , modified by Global Vo@@ ices .
published by the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians have recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regulations concerning use and benefits of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it is adopted by the Parliament , users of social media in Egypt must register with a government authority in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a job would be set up , which is tas@@ ked with giving citizens a permission to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the acceptance of the law , users should register with their correct names and ID numbers on the site of the site in order to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , this could result in a penalty of up to six months of imprisonment or a fine of money .
the bill , which consists of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ ses in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video surveillance and text . &quot;
it is not clear how the law is enforced when it is adopted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose the registration . it is not clear how they should identify those who do not register considering the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , MP and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a username and password from the Department of T@@ elecommunic@@ ations in order to get through the fire@@ wall that blocked Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall around Facebook on a national level . it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network .
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on the spot are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research techn@@ ologist ( &quot; senior research technologi@@ e@@ ologist &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Human Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , commented global Vo@@ ices :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I strongly doubt the technical capacity and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in my opinion , they imagine that as they are violent physical public and private spaces it could also be done online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I take them seriously , it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that means a mad system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its acceptance and enforcement is successful or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no dis@@ sent@@ ing nar@@ ration is present on the surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ k proposed a bill against Cy@@ ber crime in which a life sentence for those accused was found guilty of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; threatening public order &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to protest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

high up in the Kur@@ dist@@ an mountains in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal prot@@ ector H@@ ana Ah@@ med Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq work to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the bigger family of le@@ op@@ ards , who w@@ anders through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature .
why is this certain type of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large pre@@ dat@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video shows that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera table , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .

in early March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the head of Japan &apos;s northeast of Japan , documented the progress achieved over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; thre@@ ef@@ old catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an nuclear accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had caused the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a state pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tural in Japan &apos;s northeast which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring coun@@ cils Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to evacu@@ ate , as the ts@@ un@@ ami had lost entire coastal cities from the map .
the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture had an atomic accident , and 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o &apos;s special report shows the progress made six years later in order to rebuild the local residents &apos; lives .
the detailed report of the paper includes both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority and the results of the survey results .
the housing construction in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare houses ( no concern to be met ) were completed in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to record the greatest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , where 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light with 70 percent .
at the same time , six years after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ation of temporary shel@@ ters ( also to be carried out , cas@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ch@@ ak@@ u ) should be reloc@@ ated into final spare houses .
after the three @-@ way catastrophe , almost 80 000 people were forced to live in temporary shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate still lived in such dwell@@ ings .
almost 40 percent of the people evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful here . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ates , who suffered after the disaster in temporary shel@@ ters , were res@@ ett@@ led into final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure here is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has been able to determine , 10@@ 74 of 1,@@ 100 schools affected by mis@@ fortune have opened its doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later it is clear that industrial re@@ building in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while almost 100 percent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are in operation again , only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident have spread extensively in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 per cent of the ar@@ able land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed ar@@ able land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed ar@@ able land from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the &quot; nuclear lock zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma is still lag@@ ging behind .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only show 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it feels more difficult to earn their living .
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to be able to determine an overall picture , the newspaper has conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacu@@ ates . she questioned her about the state of reconstruction and how her emp@@ athy towards the ts@@ un@@ ami risk has changed .
in her introduction of the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents took measures to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents find that still not enough is done in disaster prevention .
as for those who had to be evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its issue of the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has increasingly focused its attention on the situation of the evacu@@ ates from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the massive earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed .
of 160 000 evacu@@ ates from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 000 people were displaced in areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 some more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , were res@@ ett@@ led into permanent spare houses .
after the 2017 status , more than 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma live outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas most of the evacu@@ ates , who are still in Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ wald , are older than 50 years old . they are well known because the efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma must compete with massive construction projects .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when you meet people from other countries that speak another language , the differences seem to be greater than the common ones .
after a while , however , one often real@@ ises that more connects than it seems at first glance .
these global connections are important , as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives , and remember that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices , Pod@@ cast , we look closely at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they earn .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders .

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva on a widely used photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week . last Friday , a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia had struck him with a bat@@ on against his head . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march against austerity measures .
Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , the social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a skull trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on this Saturday and now put him in an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which quickly spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a strike . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended from active service until the end of the investigation of the incident .
the pictures show the police officer how he strikes in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his stick on the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landing on the intensive care unit , his face would be on TV for six months and the entire repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ oxy@@ gen@@ ador , &quot; a press channel by media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the web , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs come to him shortly afterwards .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , is also di@@ pped up in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the Mat@@ eus family who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while he is in hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s :
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s experiences a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father because he supported the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , the military police of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App @-@ group was killed just to crimin@@ alise teachers , and here we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who has been attacked by a police officer who struck him with a stick .
police raid
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil in which it came to brutal police deplo@@ y@@ ments on demonstr@@ ators last Friday .
police officers stood in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had erected a stage for or@@ ators , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
s &amp; D Euro MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media have ret@@ ou@@ ched street protests by ste@@ aling the focus on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were specifically reporting a broken glass window to illustr@@ atively design their titles with a photo .
the O Glob@@ o , on the other hand , preferred a cover story with a fire set on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than the protests of thousands of people serving the defence of a particular cause .
this also has to be recognised if one is strictly opposed to any kind of damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here too , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning and the typical violent acts of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters on the confrontation course with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Un@@ char@@ ted Villa@@ ges in Cuba
with the introduction of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso &apos;s law , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories all over Cuba joined the doors ( Photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ en@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - a Spanish sugar mill , not@@ withstanding the fact that there is no significant sugar harvest on site .
it is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ sed .
after receipt , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the frame of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the job .
others res@@ ig@@ ned and sw@@ ung to the factories every day .
N@@ ene , a soldier @-@ veter@@ an , who rises every day at 4 : 00 o &apos;clock in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which after a long in@@ active time are in operation because they were received .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene seems to have heard exactly that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the volume produced in 1910 .
the message would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no more news .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old platform of the church saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically obsol@@ ete , and hardly competitive they were un@@ sustainable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target amounted to 4 million tons .
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agricultural Research &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the UN Agricultural and Food Organization . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go down in history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on October 21 , 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the shut@@ down of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people , received their full sal@@ aries for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez has worked in the factory since 1967 .
when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , about the closure of the factory , is the word he repe@@ ats most , &quot; sc@@ am . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents were of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full time working group .
before the first closing year , the first letters began to come .
it was the official written documents that only differ@@ ed in terms of the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve of any withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was postpon@@ ed and the letters became more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the abandoned factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation , &quot; he ass@@ ures .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , wa@@ its for retirement in another plant called Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory in which he helped build .
with each part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 working years .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work de@@ ceased was wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , no alternatives were created for the work places and services that the systems were generated in the municipalities where they were located .
we will never know if during the Mam@@ mut &apos;s speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then President saw in the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
sugar cane has been extracted only high by grinding since 2004 .

after two years Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to slaughter them , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ted the street , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to visit other factories .
they were used to spare parts .
without prospects for the future , many young people left the region .
in the area a food factory was created whose production does not even serve for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .

first Nations people use hip @-@ hop to express themselves and get their own culture
recording of a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an .
young people of the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do it through hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an @-@ Tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile audio studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were conducted by the teacher David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked with ten Cre@@ e communities in North Que@@ bec and then worked together with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the workshop is growing so that the young participants explore topics such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cultural identity , language , engagement , love , self acceptance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or whatever comes to mind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these questions are the inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagon@@ ists .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the State of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the territory of the trunk of the Kit@@ sum@@ cal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia relates , for example , the history of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a street section in western Canada , where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered .
the cases were largely un@@ explained .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences of global@@ isation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people were not always familiar with the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the refrain is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved here received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars hip @-@ hop group , who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dialect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an the verse is available in tran@@ script , as well as a translation into English translated into German here :
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
this is the day you will hear our cry
because as a youth we have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise up some@@ day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and move forward as well as our youth
this is how they can do what the Creator has ordained
in the commentary volume , the reader and supporters of the Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also contributes and adds the verse in sy@@ ll@@ able ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plastic dishes ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in Japan , plastic dishes can be seen almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin s@@ pur@@ u ( no need to be done , &quot; plastic models of dishes &quot; ) are displayed by any food served in this restaurant .
customers are looking at these plastic dishes and then decide whether they will enter or go on the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the to@@ ki@@ otic part of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a large number of these small companies that manufacture those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend is turning them into show@@ y mobile accessories and other gad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin s@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sales : new plastic bags decorated cell phone bands , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods were turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are a few sho@@ ot@@ ers fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo station .
the new boom in food production is becoming more and more complex .
in this case an imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was turned into a mobile stand .
for this tri@@ angular dish ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
we also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your cell :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and this is only the beginning of an increasing flight to the com@@ ical .
some mobile phone stands and mobile phone designers allow you to make your own work of art . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or salmon roe is used , a popular t@@ opping served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my cell phone with salmon roe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appeti@@ zing form to surprise colleagues or family members .
our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and w@@ rist@@ bands made of dried salmon .
you can look at other bizarre plastic dishes at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow the h@@ ash@@ tag # for the h@@ ash@@ tag # .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the neighborhood of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to supplying the restaurant industry .
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports from domestic and foreign media on the in@@ famous &quot; struggle against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the ming@@ led and killed regularly appear only in statistics . these , however , do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
the report on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the leader of the Sin@@ alo@@ a Cart@@ el , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background .
the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or on the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind each corp@@ se , behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
for this reason , the Mexican news portal Ani@@ mal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co called on the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; living with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) , telling these victims a voice and telling stories of people who have been involved in the struggle between law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els .
Ani@@ mal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co describes the project like this :
organized crime can not only fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ vi@@ que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how fear life &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches for secret graves after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on just one day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves today for the task which we have set ourselves to go and search for graves after the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th , he should be back , but he never came back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need a training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is also here with me .
at the moment she has no income .
you are the insurance of my father , but she doesn &apos;t pay it out because they charge a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ a a vivi@@ r con las Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the leadership of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Ani@@ mal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co , wrote this contribution from Tax@@ co , in the federal state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that we should never consider violence as normal , no matter in what form it occurs :
I have known illness and sensational journ@@ alism for several years now .
every day I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the front pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from ac@@ adem@@ ics of specialists .
it brings me out of the compos@@ ure .
sometimes I feel like I am the only person who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to that body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this to be normal .
she writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin insi@@ sts that he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug traffi@@ ckers ) if he is big . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of offen@@ ders when they walk through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cul@@ ed those who have lost somebody and those who are afraid that something will happen to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ action of man is incredible for me when the death of six people and the enforced disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified by the fact that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; di@@ ligent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to convince that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they are not stirring and still .
Mari@@ bel L. of Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the capital district : how a family was lo@@ oted by threats . &quot; in this it describes how armed criminal month paid money from their business month by month until they had destroyed not only the business , but also torn their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain on it never passes , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we will only contact you if it is absolutely necessary .
the far@@ ther we are from each other , the better .
she concluded her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , for they don &apos;t know when they will kid@@ nap or kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days , whether wines would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a generation of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing wife and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it possible to grow up in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age whose parents care for them .
Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and tells him he had to teach himself how to cook a egg , roast potatoes , tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood had passed two years ago when he saw only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody corp@@ se of his father , who was shot by armed men out of a driving car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , as violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Coun@@ cill@@ or for Public Safety and Government of the Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office numbered 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 million per day .
these are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ating a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Ani@@ mal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co launched the data journ@@ alism project &quot; Nar@@ co@@ data , &quot; whose aim is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traffi@@ cking that has tor@@ mented the country in the last four decades .
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this contribution and the pages to which he links contain pictures depicting violence .
the fac@@ t@@ check is important in a moment when it comes to lifting up a rum@@ or or expose a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but what is the year after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to ins@@ ist on .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first publication it has been mis@@ led to portra@@ y trage@@ dies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful coverage of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tank truck crossed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ cked around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war Africa &apos;s second largest country has been neglected for years and thus devast@@ ated . the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , the tank truck fell victim to it .
authorities &apos; representatives described a fire@@ ball rolling dozens of houses , including a movie theater near which was full of people watching the World Cup .
houses scattered and char@@ red corp@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were inc@@ iner@@ ated to imp@@ unity .
a picture titled &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , January 12 , 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the atro@@ cious scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies that are str@@ ung on the ground while people look at them .
but here the story does not end .
over the years , the same photo was held several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms , but wrong@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters from B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses dramatically reported atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one has left to count corp@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
the follow @-@ up time could only be illustrated by satellite images .
the reason for the attack remains unclear , but the military point in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt by B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerged from the DR Congo , as it was wrong@@ ly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
indeed , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of false attri@@ butions ; Africa Check has documented the orders of Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the picture was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings .
one step further , personal comment@@ aries such as this example fal@@ sely link the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments .
the image from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a lightning message , published by the United Nations describes those who could escape blows , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported of the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts appeared like the following , which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi @-@ Arab news page , which 2012 fal@@ sely claimed that the president of Myanmar Th@@ ein said that monks and politicians have participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate this information .
the original contribution , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be viewed here .
other news agencies , called AF@@ P as their source , also fal@@ sely attributed this statement to Th@@ ein , but had not related the picture of the DR Congo .
the global reach of false information
traces of these false coupling dates back to the years 2011 and 2012 and indeed come from all over the world .
with an inver@@ ted image search , you can see how far more information can cross boundaries .
an in@@ verse picture search with the search@@ engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) under 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said image from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed @-@ mix of private pages , social media platforms and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have sent false reports , some have tried to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have restricted examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use and linked them to the respective countries on the basis of what they have been published on which side they have been published .
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases have been connected with each other ) , several examples may be used for impro@@ per use .
here are some cases that can now be fully detected ( on the Orange map ) :
map : News Fra@@ mes .
country examples of fake coupling of the picture from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers that are still available through the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or false reports .
the Coun@@ tries in Gra@@ y are examples which , according to the metadata and information available through Tin@@ Eye , are likely to present counter@@ fei@@ ting examples .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo has been posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ an and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; War of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

one page that leaves rum@@ ors is that the photo of Christians who were killed by Muslims was shown .
Canada , 2015 .
in this paper , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City not only ap@@ points mis@@ information , but also discusses the mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria and further questions about the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies involved in it ( in DR Congo and beyond ) .
Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ Ã¡n qu@@ em@@ ando a los cr@@ isti@@ anos &quot; ( In Nigeria they burn Christians ) .
in this article about explo@@ sions in North Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , the district is identified as the Christian section of the place .
La Rep@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica quotes as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( although it is not known whether the original report has included the picture ) .
France , 2015 .
T@@ wit@@ ter@@ contributions after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am , like this one here , which used the image of the DR Congo to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam , &quot; have clearly seen no pages like Ho@@ ax@@ ob@@ ster who refu@@ te this .
Ho@@ ax@@ ob@@ ster named the faulty use of the image since 2011 in conjunction with Nigeria , then promoted by a post of US , anti @-@ Islamic comment@@ ator P@@ am@@ ela G@@ eller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Germany , 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; genocide against Muslims continues in Myanmar , Nobel Peace Prize lau@@ re@@ ate in silence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this article draws attention to the ongoing distress of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims in Myanmar , but quotes the work of an article by Indian Express with the image of the DR Congo . the article of the Indian Express had not included in the time the publication of our article of this picture .
Greece , 2012 . &quot; for that , my grandfather used my grandfather !
it is possible to produce a mushroom statement in the province of phy@@ tos@@ kul@@ el@@ ente in the province of phy@@ tos@@ och@@ na@@ Ã¯@@ vet@@ och@@ et ? &quot; ( warning !

this site used the image as evidence that Muslims killed Nicar@@ agu@@ an Christians .
this statement was re@@ fut@@ ed by a Greek fac@@ t@@ check page 2013 and once again in 2016 .
Iran , 2012 .
an association of students of the@@ ology ( mul@@ lahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims via the N@@ asi@@ m news agency and used to illustrate the image of the DR Congo .
Italy , 2015 .
an inhabit@@ ant of P@@ ie@@ di@@ ca@@ stell@@ o from Tren@@ to posted this news on his site in order to express his solidarity with the massacre in Nigeria in 2015 .
Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo from the DR Congo was shared as evidence of the bombing of B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo , expressing sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an Mass@@ ac@@ re , and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger to legi@@ timi@@ ze the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya have been used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government published a justi@@ fying report on what it meant to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliberately dark news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings concerning Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this rec@@ tification , which has been published exclusively in English , also includes references to bog@@ us pictures of rum@@ ors that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech operate and are used by extrem@@ ist groups in order to demonstrate that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often dis@@ semin@@ ated by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
Russia , 2012 . &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political provo@@ cation ? ) .
this post , addressed to members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page wrong@@ ly claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein agreed to be in 2012 that monks and politicians had been involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image from S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still contained in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article of 2014 about students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the now @-@ released , the Catholic close to the news page An@@ Ã¡@@ lis@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the picture is not from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it constitutes a &quot; similar d@@ hadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture was circul@@ ated later in connection with the massac@@ res of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there would be connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ j@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ DÃ¼n@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) .
the DR Congo image appeared with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the massac@@ res of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted their communities to pay greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was taken as evidence of the massac@@ res of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) . but the messages related there@@ to have not been taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Chinese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was allegedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this one here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it a ho@@ ax .
from the message in which the picture from the DR Congo was included , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dis@@ soci@@ ated itself .
there are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the portfolio in Gra@@ y ) , Tin@@ y@@ Eye also points out , but are no longer fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and date / date stamps exist on the Web@@ craw@@ ler and occasionally they have picture file names related to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the image may ultimately make a correct description but the original contribution is not available or accessible .

there are two strong themes or frames that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used with regard to larger discussions about the silence in connection with the kill@@ ings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the kill@@ ings of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ rated as compared to a European or French life .
understanding religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question , however , is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images .
with social media , there are tens of people who un@@ intentionally share the water around a tragedy .
suggest this mood of false and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and ad@@ orn the real horror of what is actually happening in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the dis@@ semination of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
one argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal is equivalent to recogni@@ zing the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , there is a concern that violent images sensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and spectators and take the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( for example , this study which investigated how violent media act to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
technologi@@ sts experiment with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake News . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about situations in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be used from the context or completely ab@@ u@@ sive .
each examination of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons uses the CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. insur@@ moun@@ table ) ende@@ a@@ vors to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not at all to translate .
there are such words in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish Sob@@ rem@@ esa ) .
but all stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly resist any attempt of a simple translation .
a word or phrase is not enough , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes a context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
most of these lists cover Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find , for example , words from the Mw@@ ot@@ lap language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - take care of your parents in recognition of the way around you in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words in the H@@ uns@@ mith language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - the comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that one feels after being war@@ med in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog Via :
they def@@ use other cultures , reveal other thoughts and awaken our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page want to publish even more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impres@@ sively these small languages are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speakers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka ren@@ ews the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and land@@ slide disaster in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually starts at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya came across the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
after an opinion of the disaster center of Sri Lanka from May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and just under hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and mud deposits .
over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( May 26 ) and about 100,000 people have been brought to 304 safe locations .
the rainf@@ alls ceased on Saturday ( May 27 ) and the water levels in some areas slowly declined .
health and hygiene conditions of the population are a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floo@@ ding in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water levels of up to 7,5 m . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to flood conditions .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floo@@ ding wor@@ sens the Den@@ gue crisis , warns the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are on their way .
today , the N@@ elu@@ wa Bus stood in the flood , water level up to 6 meters . the village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle was also flooded because of the water level of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a , which was flooded yesterday .
the Air Force has provided five air@@ planes for rescue operations and another five are completed for the transport of emergency supplies for the inhabitants trapped in their flooded villages .
various organizations and startups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka deliver important information on flood conditions and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call + 49 7@@ 7@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry foods and essential goods for flood victims -
we are today in the area around kel@@ eni@@ ya and r@@ asp@@ hal@@ ana .
please call + 77@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if you need help in this area .
the taxi @-@ call @-@ app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) requests concerned people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ en@@ entrum is informed .
last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me launched a &quot; flood relief &quot; button allowing users to call a vehicle for picking up assistance and donations . they were then forwarded to the s@@ ri@@ l@@ k Red Cross for free .
they also launched a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue actions for people trapped by floods and land@@ slides .
the combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully util@@ ised , bring security and aid to residents in need .
this has prevented the loss of other lives , and the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality .

the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love girlfriend .
I confi@@ de in her my four years old daughter , she confi@@ deth in me her children ; she is my rock in the midst of the fire .
in the last minute we call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights .
in the next , we chant rights for trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf tall , tied up of an American flag , others chant slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already done this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the widespread notion of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their imagination .
they ab@@ dic@@ ate me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not all look the same .
we practice different religions .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim basket .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , like me , do not fit in there , are ab@@ used .
to be m@@ apped
I &apos;m not alone .
this has even happened to the poet , whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what pictures do you get in mind when you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an orthodo@@ x Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
the Prophet Muhammad , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad , were the center of his poetry until the day he died .
but in the Western conception the religion of Rum@@ i was wi@@ ped out , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another exists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ ising Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting visual language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the pioneering Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid dis@@ assembled the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures still stand out today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continued to ste@@ er them .
I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous narr@@ atives dominate our news@@ feeds .
this narrative over@@ shad@@ owed the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the US did not even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this narrative fails to recognize that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and forcing Saudi , Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body , both of which are two sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women carrying movements for change .
it also sees that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has cast our collective imagination so deeply and er@@ ron@@ eous that often Si@@ kh men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and ch@@ ic@@ ings .
because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot;
to the 1,7 billion belong
in the news industry we do more than just telling stories based on facts .
or alternative facts .
we also create narrative , helping us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to record the narrative of 1.7 billion .
and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims in the highest degree constitute &quot; diverse &quot; religious groups in America .
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ speaking Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims are among the immig@@ rant of the first generation from 77 countries .

four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in New York sky@@ scra@@ pers ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker of Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time when Khan was re@@ thinking the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ friendly Muslims and Americans .
but am I now a Muslim and an American woman ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting my Muslim recipes out or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chief , which all Muslims carry with them - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I j@@ ok@@ er , we don &apos;t wear all hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us .
we also do not have to be the@@ ological experts to be a Muslim or to be almost always selected for additional security checks at the airport .
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who are trying to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ ist machine series with len@@ ders , think tanks and experts for false information , which is our already er@@ ron@@ eous idea of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , have manipul@@ ated .
due to the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in more than just a stranger that tears the head of a woman .
or as the terri@@ fying map of attacks on mos@@ ques throughout the USA , see below .

I would like to explain that .
I was born as Muslims , but to be a Muslim was first born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a temporary mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they rever@@ t to the following terms : belief , behavior and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my friend , my neighbor , would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslims , if they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the ni@@ gh@@ tly ritual with my daughter when I held her in my arms and she whis@@ pered the Arabic verse to the protection that seal the Qur &apos;@@ an and call the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .

belonging to my grandmother &apos;s image mat@@ ernal side with her sisters , as she has been winning over decades to contest the art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi .
it is the picture of her that at this moment I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and incomplete pictures painted Su@@ fi @-@ saint ; and a Qur &apos;@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with a hundred and fourteen chapters that she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be Muslim means to speak the prayers which she told me when I have a bad day .
to be Muslim is how she taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a nation that has been col@@ oni@@ zed for centuries by an &quot; Empire &quot; that founded a company with the name Hon@@ orable Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord .
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
belonging means growing up and listening to the fact that men do not cry , but at the same time seeing that my immig@@ rant grandfather wept .
in the meantime , while writing books about modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an cried out for his family in India ruled K@@ ash@@ mir , a family that he was not allowed to close in his arms in half a century .
belonging to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , like my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at the game risk .
to be Muslim means to know that in the last two centuries , Europeans have &quot; col@@ oni@@ zed &quot; all except four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first pilot bomb of history was thrown off over a Muslim country before a century ago .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mir under@@ tan of the British empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mos@@ que in England .
even before there were planes he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was , preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed over every continent except Antar@@ cti@@ ca , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is buried in the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim means to know that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means knowing that when a tragedy is home to the US and susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slave named Bil@@ al .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African schol@@ ar named Bil@@ hah Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people filled the airports to fight against Muslim B@@ an .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black lives .
to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple con@@ fes@@ sions , but fail to communicate with others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of the 1,7 billion hides more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the redu@@ ci@@ ble &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people establish structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia on this two @-@ day basis .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in Muslim registr@@ ations that started with President Bush and extended to President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists of the immigration officer who takes a five year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that prec@@ lu@@ des its borders towards people from just the countries that bom@@ bed it .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly list , &quot; which targets largely Arabs and Muslims .
it is the wars that we lead and the bombs that we reject on Muslim countries .
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study with the title A@@ scent of Man , scientists of the Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically sound picture and asked them to evaluate groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversation we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stand back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the fla@@ wed and dangerous visual prints we get in our news editorial offices .
at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims in the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the pod@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ Bad@@ Muslim ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increase Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope .

but I am concerned about this difficult global time point in which we are .
and this moment has consequences beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is a reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet now lead the White House .
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
a few years before , it had not yet existed ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now , but who today made me an un@@ bound Muslim .
things I have left here like a bread@@ cr@@ umb line in my speech .
things that perhaps ar@@ ouse memories , because in all the inter@@ sections that our humanity makes , a story may l@@ ur@@ k where someone is being made a &quot; different . &quot;

we need to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of being consciously and un@@ consciously the &quot; other &quot; ; just as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March because the occupation that we have no president , the chocolate cake eats while he already en@@ capsul@@ ates countries and &quot; other made &quot; people goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity
story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniele Rossi , using the CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 license .
can there be a way to connect with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of languages in large cities .
in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , there is a risk that small and not so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there .
for the cre@@ ators of the project , the following applies :
the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided by creating cities that embrace diversity - secure spaces where residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is often connected with it , these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen to the listening in order to appreciate , feel , touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers introduce their story first in their own language and translate or explain it in English .
even if the participants are not a professional story t@@ eller , their devotion and their presentation lead to the audience getting involved .
they cry out laugh@@ ing and emotion as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional Burkina Faso history telling in the Daf@@ ing language . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ ara tells the f@@ able of the rab@@ bit and the Pa@@ vian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; after explaining the importance of his ability , John Ny@@ am@@ ara asks : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were with me !
so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to extend it . all those who are inspired by the project can get in touch with T@@ LS to organize their own story stories .
Puerto Rico claims to re @-@ establish state debt by the United States
with the aim of a re @-@ check of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which rose to 72 million US dollars , various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration last 3 April 2017 ; the march started with the American Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went up to Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ an .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( citizen &apos;s front for the ne@@ ural examination of debts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical congregation of Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of rein@@ stating the debt have also submitted a petition to the official home page of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Rico claim that the politicians , bank@@ ers and government authorities responsible for debts will be held ac@@ coun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for financial review and a management committee without personal interest in public debt , with a firm , our working conditions appropriate compensation , which acts in favor of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Rico are ref@@ using to pay a debt that is not theirs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to reconci@@ le with falling pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy &quot; proposes a non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organisation without a party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
measures imposed from outside will be at risk without the participation and conviction of the citizens to be rejected by the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration carried the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night Gu@@ ards for Light and Truth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

this book wants to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what are the real costs associated with .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was removed from the A@@ dra prison directory in which he was sitting on October 3 , 2015 .
since then we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Collec@@ tive Memory gives his friends and his family a voice that push@@ es him to his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , right away .
seeing Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have started to think about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
what have we given up in this process of partly extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown place from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; military police of Bass@@ el on the basis of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strictly secret &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; command of the military court had taken from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by people on 12 November 2015 who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband .
his where@@ ab@@ outs and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding the access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ le &apos;s cultural prototypes was more pres@@ cient than the work he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civil@@ isations and here the Greek @-@ Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influence .
Bass@@ el could not know at that time that ten years after he began this work , the IS would do everything possible to wipe out this architecture which not only em@@ bodies the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el couldn &apos;t finish this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life with freedom to dream and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English even when he was in jail .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked . he taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a commission which she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was det@@ ained .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for a year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from the Arabic into English .
the book is available roy@@ alty @-@ free .
book cover by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; It Happ@@ ens &quot; :
it happens on every visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose my mind in the moment we embrace ourselves ,
that I don &apos;t care about any of the hazards ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards
I forget the crow@@ ding of the prison
and I will enter into every detail of your voice and your words ,
which I carry with passion with me ,
when your eyes say good@@ bye
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my sol@@ itude ,
to rec@@ la@@ im all the moments ,
and to we@@ ep and smile about your absence .
I testify to myself that I will return soon ...

Bas@@ que &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
since the protests in 2011 against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those who were arrested or disappeared under the rule of force by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
by 2016 , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in jail since 2011 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we repeat our call today in the hope that we must do this for the last time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moz@@ ambique : head of prison sentenced to previous post due to corruption
Moz@@ ambique re@@ acted to a corruption case in which a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state machine after half of his prison sentence in which corruption was committed .
this is the case of Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 together with four other defend@@ ants .
the money came from public funds from the Moz@@ ambique airports , the Council of which ruled Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 due to good leadership and immediately called for its rein@@ statement to the company , which happened on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement from the Republic At@@ tor@@ ney &apos;s Office of the Republic which evaluated the application , there would be no barrier for Cam@@ ba@@ za to resume his old post as the company did not undergo disciplinary proceedings after his detention .
however , many people don &apos;t like the action well .
in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , C@@ IP ) , a local institution supporting public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to hire the director again :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and exemp@@ li@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we note is that the company should have initiated a disciplinary action against the re@@ acting .
however , the company apparently kept silent and did not make appropriate legal action for the application of the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the social media of Moz@@ ambique , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; :
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of that .
he could give paid talks and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could consult and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inflic@@ t harm .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za enjoys to be paid for his silence .
it is disgu@@ sting !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ can and student of political science in Brazil says that the director doesn &apos;t have any moral whatsoever :
Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him I can &apos;t believe that one rewards someone in such a way that insul@@ ted the state so massi@@ vely .
Cam@@ ba@@ za is missing mor@@ als and serve the state , * he had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but has instead only served himself in the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was sum@@ mon@@ ed and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief is in prison :
thi@@ eves belong to the Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison and will not only be remembered as the first independent president to the Moz@@ ambi@@ ans , but also as a sharp , inc@@ isi@@ ve and - by the way - proph@@ etic utter@@ er .
one of his most famous oral representations was when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of everything , even the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest to sell . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that it is not that way . he changes tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is at the same time criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison for 10 years and was released .
and today the company , in which he with@@ stands funds , is under contract again . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Ñ@@ Î±@@ Î´@@ Î¹@@ toll ( @ az@@ zy _ Ra@@ fik ) 12 May 2017

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ a or spl@@ itting b@@ lower . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts off the grid because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although still discussed about the origin of the word , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or are generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese writing ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely degra@@ ding con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word used mostly by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as a hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; many people have reported that posts in which they have talked about the use of the word have been cens@@ ored for use of the word .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , it is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spl@@ its ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ kn@@ it A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he had asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way whether they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n play .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sentence ku la - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - is very similar to rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were various reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is of the opinion that it will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also pointed out that Facebook must be analytical before wi@@ ping out all the posts that are suspected of spreading rac@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook does not delete the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Facebook .
what should be done instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the spoken words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( spl@@ itting b@@ sen ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , receive a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise her nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to all who dis@@ semin@@ ate hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have shown that the cens@@ orship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks can simply start using a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word in order to express their views .
author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started er@@ asing his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new policy of Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was banned from posting , post and share content for 24 hours , because the mail &quot; didn &apos;t meet the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a number of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community to ask for advice :
Facebook likes to have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to l@@ essen rac@@ ism in Burma through its platform , but it doesn &apos;t work .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also seems as though they have started this without local context or technical support and have prohibited words like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied messages .
if they had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big revenue , that would be great .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automatic cens@@ orship has provided much ridi@@ cu@@ le among users . &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of taking it seriously , users are now making fun of Facebook and consciously writing the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech in order to see if their posts are taken off the grid .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that did not contain any hate speech but were nevertheless removed :
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , then heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should additionally stimulate violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts forced thousands to flee .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for its failure to bring out the balancing hate speech on its bur@@ m@@ ese pages .
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have looked better in context than on code @-@ concentrating initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago concludes with the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country unanim@@ ously decided on a law to prohi@@ bit this practice , so that the age of marriage is now 18 .
prior to this change in marriage , some members of Hin@@ du and Muslim religious communities were adher@@ ing to practice , and in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ b@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , a group representing the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere , since that , old age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner of the UN Convention on Children &apos;s Rights , the min@@ ors as , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every person under 18 years of age &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were married to 15 in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago amounted to 2.8 percent , and at 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married under 19 from 1997 to 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements , which were striving to abol@@ ish laws on children &apos;s marriage , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support .
but not everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about saying to the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition stir@@ red up tensions in this really un@@ complicated matter , and at some point there was doubt whether the opposition would agree to the bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the draft bill against the children &apos;s marriage was decided - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
now only the president of the country has to agree and announce the law .
one of the sen@@ ators of the country published a status update on Facebook that posted Les@@ lie @-@ An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and none of them voted against it .
having previously been decided in the Senate , the draft may now become a law .
the majority of social media users were enthusiastic because the laws on children &apos;s marriage were finally changed .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a minister of the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk that obsc@@ ured the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and this is worth almost every price .
while Abel Jackson thought it took long enough to abol@@ ish practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says , &quot; Out@@ standing news !
the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for this - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota belonging to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group who openly talked about the importance of the adoption of the law , noted :
the age of marriage in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now amounts to 18 years irrespective of religious affili@@ ation .
the draft on the change of the marriage network was decided today , on June 9 , 2017 .
there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 of them were present at the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all de@@ pu@@ ties who were opposed have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the children &apos;s marriage is no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long struggle ( ... ) # child@@ birth .
many thanks to all the activists who fought him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our MEPs .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most well @-@ known Hin@@ du organisation of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take legal steps , the law was to be adopted , and he seems to make his promise now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al Ra@@ wi , an advoc@@ ate of the law , said that it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , most social media users desired that the debate on the subject would be different .
Patricia Wor@@ m@@ ack@@ ie suggested :
dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion so broad@@ ly , in a way that can only evo@@ ke panic and disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure when we , instead of talking about the problem , that the state that protects our daughters from being mis@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are over them , would you be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to legal action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where children &apos;s marriage is legal or still the norm , although there are laws which they prohi@@ bit .

on Sunday , the Office of the Prosecutor informed the local news service Y@@ ar@@ News that they were h@@ ack@@ ed .
by mirr@@ oring web pages , Turkish users can check out Wikipedia content .

for more than a month Turkey has been blocking the popular cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia based on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle .
day after day , it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the block@@ age .
although many tech sav@@ vy users are used to using conversion tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third @-@ largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence of the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking Article from Wikipedia since 2008 , as described recently in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular blocking of the Internet has been held since 2007 following the adoption of the Internet Law ( No 56@@ 51 ) .
according to China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains closed , there are now several mirror sites ( pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and are frequently updated ) .
one solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform dis@@ sec@@ ted all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentr@@ alized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
the content is available , despite legal prohibition .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about its efforts :
after listening to the news ( through the ban on Wikipedia ) , we put everything in place to take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , there is the possibility to read the contents on decentr@@ alized and distributed way .
this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia contents , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also indicated that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia @-@ Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .

essentially , the server continues the query to the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if it is locked in Turkey .
for this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ ry with poorly positioned motives and washed colors .
this motivated him to carry a camera himself and try to strai@@ gh@@ ten the situation .
back then he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring N@@ ept@@ une to the international scene .
and his hom@@ etown directly next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photographs that draw attention to N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class position helps in his work :
I live at the edge of the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just sat at home when I suddenly called myself to Navar@@ re ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he received a call from my father that a le@@ op@@ ard would be on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river Kur@@ fÃ¼r@@ sten@@ damm is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started to kne@@ el pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar aims to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he should know &#91; it &#93; , for he had already seen tig@@ ers face to face :
a tiger cannot be disturbed by the mind of the sheep in sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
bed@@ time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness when the king of the Bu@@ wei@@ k suddenly appeared . he immediately sat down , we look at ourselves and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation . &quot;
however , his passion for the promotion of Nepal &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and usually lived in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ ters at the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could take a picture of a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation .
take a look at some of these photos below .

this contribution was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version has been reis@@ su@@ ed as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women have the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h women commit to respecting the husband as a result of social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was con@@ vic@@ ted of the Indian State of O@@ dish@@ a by a bog@@ us court and expelled from her family and the village community after calling an attached relatives by name .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives by name is also common among men . however , they have far fewer re@@ mitt@@ ances to fear , if at all which ones , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and became the main theme of the city .
it is a place for them alone , where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and advoc@@ ates the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to detect practices , such as children &apos;s marriage and the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected people , and direc@@ ts these clubs .
it reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them amb@@ ass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in their discussion was by women not calling their hus@@ bands by name .
she decided on this subject because she wanted to open the talk about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem that women could easily identify with .
to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands not al@@ oud , is a custom that they all uph@@ old and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful , as a woman without mor@@ als .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this until this discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try out at home as it is going .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini told us :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him by now on his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , upset , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us what they want , does it mean they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ve of the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the Bre@@ ak of an age @-@ old tradition where married women never allowed to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini told us :
a woman was so shy that she chu@@ ck@@ led before him during the whole exercise ; another decided to release the whole pent @-@ up fru@@ stration for him and his family by cursed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
in an adren@@ alin rush about having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that at home they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands by name .
and they kept their word .
in the coming days , Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put the women in her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it for dinner in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she got sc@@ ared and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini told me to do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation started out in force .
Roh@@ ini reported how women tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the forehead that indicates the mar@@ ital status :
why do women need to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ ed point if he would also do it .
he only laugh@@ ed and I stopped wearing it .
the other women have not stopped completely with it , but think that they are now in a better position to choose themselves not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the Dis@@ cussion Club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip at every disc@@ us club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cake for the first time in their lives ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so hon@@ estly about some things , such as our identi@@ ties on our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say certain things out loud , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to the clothes .
some women in the group have only worn sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most , that &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ ine Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a trousers ; they did not dare .
after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code , the mor@@ als associated with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled her own pair of tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion round , so that the women could wear them .
next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will manage it .
on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since the first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly :
so far we have only made small steps .
some women tried it a few times , but stopped saying the name of her husband again .
some , including me , do it , but only when they are alone and are no other family members .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at any time .
the women in the Dis@@ cussion Club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or their own dress code - are at the end of a heavily navig@@ ating river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini declares :
every one of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am it too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we are all in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a memorial day
the Beat@@ les in their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot from the official YouTube channel of Beat@@ les .
on the 29th of June this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was no longer necessary ( The Beat@@ les Memorial Day ) in the Japanese Twitter Trend , where many fans shared memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is considered a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in 1964 in London , noted in 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just five days , the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to make the Japanese crazy .
it became clear to the people here that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language , &quot; says Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
good morning ! ! today is the Beat@@ les Memorial Day in Japan . no more than 51 years ago they were here in Tokyo .
also today songs are sung by the Beat@@ les in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English lessons at Japanese middle schools .
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les has survived all .
today Beat@@ les Day is a day of remembrance .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doll John L@@ enn@@ on is to represent or not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as it is for fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the well @-@ known places related to the band .
if you love The Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places that you absolutely need to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Matthew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( From the link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
pilgri@@ ma@@ ges may sometimes not be bizarre enough :
good morning together .
today Beat@@ les Day is a day of remembrance .
exactly today in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the film K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
we did the same last year .
and of course , some companies use the fan community in terms of market conditions , such as this R@@ amen shop ( Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen !
and what could this be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today and eat R@@ amen @-@ no@@ od@@ les with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how the day will run today .
so , we hope you &apos;re there !

bald men are dra@@ gged and killed in Moz@@ ambique
the police of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia warned the population that men of bald could be targets of attacks in Moz@@ ambique .
photo : An@@ ders Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0
a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald people for organ traffi@@ cking , probably for dis@@ believing purposes , is disturbing the police of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambique . the local government now called a series of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was found be@@ headed and part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently admitted that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used .
there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man can reveal gold or bring wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia of the BBC explained .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Moz@@ ambique .
another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , is people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the UN to carry out a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Moz@@ ambique are target of ritual attacks , the Moz@@ ambi@@ can police warned according to the latest assass@@ inations of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ k , where the kill@@ ings took place .
hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Moz@@ ambique , said that the local police had already followed the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia , for probably un@@ faithful rituals , has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans .
in the last days , three men were murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country .
Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha par@@ ted on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the B@@ log@@ gers poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , indicating that the problem is part of the greater social difficulties faced by Moz@@ ambique :
I M@@ Ã@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE E@@ IN Moz@@ ambique , TH@@ AT LO@@ VE@@ D A country in which people would have embarrass@@ ed to ask for sex against good marks , and women would not hurt or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country where people would not hurt hon@@ estly or even bald @-@ headed for dis@@ believing purposes or &quot; black magic . &quot;
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not miss the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humor .
Zen@@ aida &apos;s Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambique and enthusiastic t@@ witter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the head of the Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a district , Pedro Sap@@ ange , as well as the police spokes@@ man Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald heads :
Moz@@ ambi@@ can authorities are very worried about the assass@@ inations of bald people .

we are deeply affected by the death of our friend Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il .
we mo@@ urn for him and speak our deepest sympathy to his family , his friends and all those who have known him and loved him .
a pioneer of Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) plays a key role in expanding the public &apos;s access to the Internet and Open Knowledge .
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our meeting in Arab blo@@ gger in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ le &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people who were themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government .
they reported that their husband had been condemned to death , but gave no further information .
Bas@@ tille &apos;s stay and constitution were unknown until today ( 01 . August 2017 ) when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials learned that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , Bass@@ el &apos;s work as a pioneer of the Open Web movement will be the honour .
and we appreciate the efforts of all the individuals and organizations that have been campaig@@ ning for their release within the last five years .
since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , such as the Syrian Network for Human Rights organization .
countless of those arrested or forci@@ bly disappeared by the regime are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 , no fewer than 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans died in custody , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International .
the fate of many people remains unknown .

free Bass@@ el : citizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o caught attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized due to liver cancer .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state endanger@@ ment ) after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that demanded democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Department in China referred to Li@@ u &apos;s case as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internal affair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and told a spokes@@ man that he considered it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , China continues to take calls from the international community to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to allow him treatment abroad .
while some countries have critici@@ zed the harsh treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out on the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ised several foreign reactions .
United Nations united nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to permit treatment abroad .
Norway in Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 was awarded to Li@@ u , despite the fact that the Norwegian government announced that it would ultimately have nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were only resum@@ ed in December last year . in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume exports to China , because exports have largely been blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us , as announced in a statement on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect China to raise all limitations of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family members .
they should meet and receive all the visits they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; us Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told us that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him the possibility of treatment abroad , so that he can help him in his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for the US embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on 27 June that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from their house arrest .
the US Embassy &apos;s request attracted a fur@@ ious answer from China , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and to make ir@@ responsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley told us that China should offer the couple the following :
protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice , according to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to urge the Chinese government to un@@ condition@@ ally release Li@@ u and his wife .
I urge China to un@@ condition@@ ally release Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o so that he can go to a proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany , Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on July 7 and 8 at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources in Beijing reported to the Reu@@ ters news agency that China had great concerns whether the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada - Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called on China to provide Li@@ u with an appropriate medical care and to give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ us advoc@@ ate previously told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police have always watched the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk and contact someone outside , including his lawyers .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada ur@@ ges China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to release the rights advoc@@ ated to exercise these rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
France - France
France &apos;s Foreign Office urged China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons in a statement on 29 June :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information whether France will eventually receive it .
Taiwan on the wan@@ e
the Council of Foreign Affairs in Taiwan called on China on 27 June to release Li@@ u and show a greater tolerance for those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese law@@ gi@@ ver Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned about Li@@ u in an explanation on June 28 and indicated that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn had contributed to a more peaceful world .
I felt very moved and encouraged also when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 that stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Doma@@ ine Public
is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore was to be regarded as a city .
this remark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association , the Minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party because they compared Singapore with other countries .
he supported that Singapore should be regarded as a city .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turn the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land , one hears that ultimately we are not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very noble : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of that , he in@@ vari@@ ably appeared un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core point of the topic , the good old leader appears again from the author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , leaving the distorted logic , as it fits better to their power .
in the end , during the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , the answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judicial system , our political system were really non @-@ answers .
he tar@@ ried related questions with non @-@ rep@@ lies of rational nature .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls on Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to show his opinion , since she did not understand this conclusion .
personally , I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam took the trouble to enligh@@ ten this point if he was paid up to be part of the government of the City of Singapore .
by publishing his comment on the blog , he points out the critic@@ isms that one should start reading the entire con@@ scrip@@ tions of the conference so that one can better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; read the tran@@ script . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities have seen a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who as the leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it properly and is aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ covers the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; has Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam committed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good faith &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian spokes@@ man ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , what country will the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore return ?
Singapore is unique , it is both country and city .
as he plays an important role within the cabinet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapore do their military service , but don &apos;t they defend their own country ?
who must our prime minister re@@ pay bills ?
what is the value of our pink ID card ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journey of a Dec@@ ade zur Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and always was a city : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapur ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defence of the country especially &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather talk about the defence of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked Sh@@ ould his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or homeland ?
their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world uncovered and another fac@@ et to be shown .
the latest part of this series is from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor of Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question that is most asked in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I have been living in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions .
my clari@@ fication is usually followed by the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans perhaps cook in@@ war@@ dly of anger if they are kept for Americans , but that doesn &apos;t bo@@ ther me .
for someone who does not know himself , there is little that Canadi@@ ans distinguish us from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans put a Canadian flag on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all dear Canadi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand ... .
so it was already when I started travelling through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously often say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country for ethnic groups .
we are not like these guys at the south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first of all , I have many American friends , which I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if I was confused with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first of all , being called &quot; nice &quot; means being fun - just like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; Die S@@ imp@@ sons &quot; ( who has an own Canadian double @-@ go@@ er ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if Canada really is a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has no personality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
to be harmless means to be un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and not to earn any attention .
it can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from things happening around you .
I would even go as far as saying that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps simply cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence across the fence .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our Prime Minister made Canada almost sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ dies Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
a pop band in Thailand released a music video that par@@ o@@ dies the Jun@@ ta , which in 2014 took power and , in spite of its promise to re @-@ establish the civilian government , continued to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells him what prec@@ ep@@ ts his girlfriend does .
although not explicitly political , the music video still refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for the song was a huge success .
in the first three days , the video uploaded to Facebook was shared 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists called on the public to watch this video . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it relates to the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta domination .
take a look at these videos of the videos that relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has har@@ assed in the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives the Supreme Commander an absolute decision @-@ making authority over important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious programme of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change of imagination &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are considered critics by the Jun@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was also established in the army which monitors the online content and prosec@@ utes people who have been accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy .
Thailand uses a strict ban against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic insul@@ t ) .
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was declared in Thailand .
two days later , it came to a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that purchasing is unnecessary and a waste of tax@@ pa@@ yers .
in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van before putting them into an intern@@ ment warehouse , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are in prison because they allegedly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should insul@@ t the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the song showed members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Hunger Games of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by Putin &apos;s opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life goes on in the ruins of gh@@ ost towns in eastern ab@@ ch@@ asia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ry Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was published first on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society is slowly re@@ covering in East Asia Minor , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
more than 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ an War has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still strongly visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ sh@@ ava are located in the coal basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
various ethnic groups , such as Russians , Greeks , Cau@@ cas@@ us , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians , lived and worked to Soviet sites in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , most of the Russians and rab@@ bits live in the area .
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
in the pre @-@ war period more than 10.000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people after having barely increased over a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ ch@@ uk@@ ov@@ kas , symboli@@ ze the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are in decay and very rarely , they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a local elder man .
he begins a conversation and it is difficult for him to finish this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why speak ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were communal centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , serving all of the community .
now there is only paved road with blown magni@@ fic@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have meanwhile abandoned the district .
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live .
approximately 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ z@@ ka , which still houses one or two families , can be seen on the balconies where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me in the hand with the camera , they withdraw immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden us to be photographed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she simply banned us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultiv@@ ating agricultural products for personal consumption ) such as livestock , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation .
it &apos;s difficult to get over the rounds .
the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages in winter .

about ten years ago an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a , as it is called in the neighborhood ) moved from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to J@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her el@@ dest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave off to Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will stay in Ab@@ ch@@ asia forever , &quot; she tells .
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to accept financial support from her daughter and ins@@ ist that she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
the monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you don &apos;t have a vegetable garden or a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells us that she and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are , we visit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the floor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we &apos;ll build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can get used to everything &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a conversation partner Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she re@@ members the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia simply broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take some time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha holds around $ 9 child money for each child .
her husband works in the coal mines .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once located , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chi@@ ckens .
she tells us that it was a very sc@@ ary situation at first when many people left the village after the war .
but over time it lost its anxi@@ ousness .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and everyone lived as it was right for them .
I remember every day how the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our conversation comes to an end , a little boy ad@@ mits to us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy hun@@ ts behind him .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
while they walk , some of them throw stones on the ruined buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , which cause uncertainty in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it differently .

&quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Afrika &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses migrants on their long journey &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border from Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org on 19 April 2017 .
on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , located at the border with Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city centre .
it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink frame and gold @-@ coloured earrings in ted@@ dy bear form .
it is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel doesn &apos;t have any charm .
for about $ 2.@@ 50 per night guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and metal beds .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign to the hotel , but hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants arrive here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells , people come in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they start crying : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at present it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has welcomed 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some even slept outside on boxes .
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anyone .
she also helps them and brings them to hospital when they are ill , she bu@@ ys drugs that they cannot afford , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted by the long journey .
Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently .
I asked him if M@@ om Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with their daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a go@@ at@@ ee mou@@ sta@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children there .
they have already lived in Brazil , but for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States , it is normal to make a first stop in South America and then move north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he says that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans often travel along the route and that Afri@@ cans already speak to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived previously in Brazil and worked as a construction worker at the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to purchase the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will have contact with Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers , smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always be in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells her that her guests often send text messages when they have left to greet them or to tell her about the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the driving force of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spark hope for the migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city , a cu@@ l de sa@@ c leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have immig@@ rated into their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive .
he began to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have seen what they are experiencing .
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after he lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job .
the majority of migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children in front of people who wanted to black@@ mail him money without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a single person , offered him her roof .
a few months later the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go the next step .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the corri@@ dors , the travellers always consult their tel@@ eph@@ ones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part from Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who left .
like a proud grandmother she leaves her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair care she has made her a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly , while she introduces it to me .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repe@@ ats every time . &quot; they have gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users in the course of the event
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an District of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi got a mobile notification in which it instruc@@ ts the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the announcement , the app will prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preventing access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the authorities could also use the app for more than comb@@ ating terrorism .
according to Radio Free Asia &apos;s exclusive report , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because , shortly after they had installed the app , they had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the notification of the police , the app would identify and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists along with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal religious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activities and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harmful information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ ger &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main feature is blocking of por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to remote control their own home network .
this app , with the min@@ ors &apos; filters , is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many different ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remote control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while reporting on digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focuses on users &apos; experiences in larger cities in the East and South , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded , ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often judge extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs .
the Twitter @-@ based media outlet , &quot; Images from mainland China , &quot; published by cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where polic@@ emen tried to verify the inhabitants random@@ ly whether they had installed the monitoring app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , you could be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they forced the people to use devices intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; also released a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description from which the software can lift up the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus un@@ restricted access to the hard drive of the computer .
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computer and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang regulations may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the dis@@ semination of illegal content .
all branches of government , authorities and affiliated institutions , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office in the operation of their computers and communication devices .
a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a regulation on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi in order to register their &quot; personal ID cards , cell phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at the local police .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrorist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; videos . however , this action viol@@ ates the Person@@ ality Rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible off@@ enses , including those relating to peaceful religious or political communications . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sleep or Death , Part 1 : all scre@@ ams after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie B@@ ark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; Sle@@ ep or Death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and note that you are all alone in a place where all the important van@@ ished .
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recognis@@ able , both from the inside and from the outside .
one who gives honour to her name .
one that has struck down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
but when the reality catches you up and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters are transformed into beings of flesh and blood , and everything scre@@ ams after death .
all doubts arise in smoke and you will be aware of your existence even when the Earth moves on the axis of the Un@@ hei@@ st . it becomes clear to you that you are caught here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone to stone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn my lesson &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he demonstrated his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to merge the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ la@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all neighbor@@ hoods were cov@@ eted , just my own .
for the first time it was silent , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city which has been stu@@ ffed into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things had a little cal@@ ming down after the power supply stopped in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ la@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice resist@@ ing silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to get together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we al@@ lied to a grand picture that filled my expectations fully and completely .
in such a moment you realize that you release the mind from the lamp , but it just doesn &apos;t interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he lay down .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ amed it all the way to the office of the security service .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear how you write &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ la@@ hu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are only brave enough to scre@@ am if we are not near . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes set themselves on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you &apos;re sorry to look into my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I was standing in front of this building .
perhaps it was about my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity , perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my thing when I answered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement and his father straight away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is equal to that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this accur@@ sed movement lies still today in the nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture that I was exposed for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
then back through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I pre@@ tend all the details before I enter the room .
unlike otherwise , they probably allocated a larger cell to me this time .
I have to share it with only one more prisoner , and I am allowed to sit right away without waiting for permission .
after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I res@@ or@@ ted to a tried @-@ and @-@ tested communication method : beating the fist towards the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ s@@ th@@ Ã¤@@ ft@@ ling &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
apparently in none of the surrounding cells lay a respected middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness , no prominent tra@@ its can be seen in me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator assured me that they would release him if I stayed .
li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to ch@@ ase all these crow@@ s , which refresh themselves at the fruits of my head &apos;s garden .
from the distance I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; Al@@ la@@ hu ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cries are heard , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the colour of cal@@ am@@ ity until I saw the yellow light that brought us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; all@@ usion to 13 . Sur@@ ah of the Quran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be questioned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the secret was revealed : in order to protect the state security against us and prevent us from expos@@ ing the betra@@ yer and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - so they played their denom@@ in@@ ational black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow vision of their world view .
this is not a house that is not a land here ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to turn the criminals of their clan into a hero .
I enter the audi@@ torium and meet on Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he is doing so .
he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that gli@@ de him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest to demonstrations that will soon end up . &quot;
I did not answer .
I am accustomed to not responding .
I can &apos;t really say exactly when insul@@ ts and blows have become an ordinary means of communication for me .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me told me that I had to get used to being punished , even though I didn &apos;t do anything to make that penalty .
of punishment in all their diversity .
his command is to plu@@ ck as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls this lovingly &quot; confession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the kno@@ cks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices at your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you can &apos;t keep your scre@@ ams back .
my cries were not enough for him , which is why they exchanged the pipe with a cable .
at my first arrest , I wondered if the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a garbage collector , or whether it belonged to the normal working equipment .
they inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to show us the great invention of a giant cable from their point of view .
within a single hour three of them altern@@ ated , while I was still in the row .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I ceased crying .
the hang@@ man noticed the cooling down and didn &apos;t take any pleasure in it , which is why he interven@@ ed next to an electrically loaded rod .
electricity flow@@ ed through my whole body , enough to supply my entire neighborhood .
my half @-@ naked body lying stretched out on the floor was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours passed , which occurred to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted young person : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father must be fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and move , you &apos;ll be la@@ zy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always left me free .
where do they lead me ? !
Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and opposition
Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b rush@@ es a cigarette into his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time in@@ doors ; sometimes he slides to his canvas , sometimes to his computer , back and then also to his couch .
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives in the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s family to flee from their village in Palestine , where they lived as fel@@ ha@@ ye@@ es ( about : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their well @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape .
with his music , which often deals with issues like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown Am@@ man , but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by borders in his mind , and he can sympath@@ ise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even though he does not openly admit it , he has a special a@@ version to the US foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b doesn &apos;t believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , has anything to do with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian f@@ lar@@ ed second generation , &quot; he calls himself even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; I don &apos;t think so because of my own circumstances , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b emphasizes .
then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while he poured out Nes@@ cafÃ© in two cups in water . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a scor@@ ching hot day has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically the lu@@ gs chat lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the squ@@ ad@@ rons of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose primarily of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when you take a look at the neighbouring countries .
therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan to drink water - in order not to land in prison .
recently , the interior ministry of Jord@@ ani@@ ens has cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front @-@ singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , contradic@@ ts the country &apos;s cultural and traditional standards and is the main reason for the concert evening .
the MP and former press spokesperson on the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer .
many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is a dangerous activ@@ ism , which in@@ as@@ cri@@ bes the old @-@ tried legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la under@@ estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to opt for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement should probably not simply be shallow rhet@@ oric , but actually reflect an increasingly clear cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b ma@@ stered traditional gender norms by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who had pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who should actually trust them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years Jordan has increased the number of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honour mur@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the in@@ official outside . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honour mur@@ ders reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way .
according to a crime against crime in 1954 , women who are exposed to the threat of domestic violence can &quot; be imprisoned in prison in@@ definitely , &quot; and their release often requires years of bureaucratic expenditure and the family &apos;s guarantee that nothing will happen to the woman .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from issues that have long been considered t@@ abo@@ o in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b denied that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come out of the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; politics has been tor@@ tured , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b attacks the question of the Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Lav@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated stri@@ k@@ ingly often :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you can , in his words , &quot; get what you want &quot; - be it belief or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he notes that hardly anyone speaks in Jordan about the rights of gay men and les@@ bians and that comments on the equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals have been widely cens@@ ored by 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , in order to see later that his comments were torn , twisted and cens@@ ored in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but stre@@ amed only a edited version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b openly adverti@@ ses the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als does not correspond to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b wonders : if Abu Nu@@ what , who was to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jordan not ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom there is nothing new anymore that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service found several former members of the government and members of the teacher association , stating that they had critically ev@@ oked comments in social media related to the problems associated with the corruption deeply rooted in the country .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him , progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has now denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - that is what H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees - consists of slow , thou@@ ghtful and internal changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
ultimately , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without interventions from abroad .
he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; experience them . &quot;
perhaps the region will conver@@ ge with the help of music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and artificial cra@@ cies . at least he hopes that .
until the time has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and consequently resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ ors are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
it is thought that it is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the fort@@ resses , drums and dancing have been handed over for over a thousand years and come from a time when armies from west Japan mar@@ ched into the northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Emis@@ hi , to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could pick up some great seats , so we had a great view .
one can hardly imagine how large these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition about W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have been looking forward to the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two solid cars are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ uch@@ a@@ festival .
the sight of a 18 @-@ metre @-@ tall solid car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange weapons against scissors and straight raz@@ ors

external appearance and body care were rare as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate occupation like that of the bar@@ ber .
El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are com@@ mon@@ place .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to more and more normal citizens to go into the skilled hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the bar@@ ber competition &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there , experts compete against each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current cont@@ ests are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school Augu@@ sto Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive training in hair@@ dres@@ sers instead of bad advice , which allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special educational workshops and reported some of its successes :
in 1995 , we were the only college in the community and the district where we are very proud , because we have built up this educational community out of love for the children .
Colombia : letter of Love to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with kind permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Love Mess@@ ages of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
is it not even more important to bring affection to people who feel ki@@ cked out ?
it was precisely this question that the young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ ra@@ ga from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation and Cr@@ isti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation did not move out of their heads and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ a p@@ or la Sol@@ li@@ aciÃ³n ( letters on reconciliation ) which encourages young people to write letters .
recently , their country was the setting of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government closed a peace agreement with the guer@@ ri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces of Colombia ) forming the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
international was considered to be so significant that the Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the Colom@@ bians , however , there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , who lived in illegal camps for many years , were exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carried their weapons around the clock , must now integrate themselves into the lives of civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , which had become accustomed to living in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now absorb it into its ranks and support it in the construction of a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an were convinced that the young Colum@@ bians would have to join together and help with the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : so far thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter - to be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the reconciliation was born at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an had the opportunity to talk with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
he explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need much more .
he continued to share his love with people that needed most of the attention this year .
so the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now need to find their place in society and build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story a common history of peace , &quot; she says .
to date , more than 2,000 letters have been collected within the framework of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ .
&apos;@@ i never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over on March 19 in one of the UN camps in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca .
a group of 40 students from the University Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bo@@ got@@ a Foundation travelled to the camp to bring the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC have set themselves up as they had done before , in order to receive the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the political scientist Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Gover@@ nor of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former fighter fought me through the camp of guer@@ illa fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters live ) I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go , because beside him on the bed there was a M@@ GL @-@ gar@@ net , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will answer a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
never in my life someone wrote me something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; suddenly the tears flow@@ ed over the che@@ eks .
I hu@@ gged him completely , and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was too tired of war , was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside that wa@@ its for us with open arms .
until now I only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new Vo@@ ices
at the start of the event , students and some of the leaders of the F@@ ARC met for a discussion .
the students were all grown up as already in war , and the F@@ ARC already acted in secret .
that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC have declared the history of the organization , their ideals , and gave an insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have seen how social injustice was exer@@ ting on the whole Colom@@ bian people . now that we have the opportunity to develop a political party , we can help shape society more just in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of them said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
hearing these people who had never been hearing and had no right to vote , and recogni@@ zing that the people whom I often had seen as monsters and even hate , were just people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives is hur@@ ting me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and executed so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g .
many ex @-@ comb@@ at@@ ants have responded to the letters .
Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the camp commander in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote the following letter for the example of the Archbishop of Cal@@ i , the Archbishop of the town of Cal@@ i :
the Colom@@ bians were prophes@@ ied that peace would rule after dis@@ armament .
this is not the case .
as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people willing to resort to arms , rise and protest for their rights . and that is also fully justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC are now focusing on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter which race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , for we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will be faced with many difficulties .
there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them .

hom@@ os@@ exual and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
activists have witnessed the reporting of the last few months about the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that hangs over the LG@@ BT@@ Q community over the LG@@ BT@@ Q community did not arise overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has won the international head@@ lines several months ago after reports have been published that addressed the deportation , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of Ch@@ echn@@ ya authorities , arrested qu@@ eer men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in gun .
&quot; you brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
since her childhood she felt she was a woman in reality .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens experienced the gender equality of their rural women , the ch@@ ase was opened on Sab@@ rina .
fear@@ ing for her life , she finally moved to the United States .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took it without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he was a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
after that the photos of my documents by the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App made the round .
on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I was about to bring out a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you honor the family , you cry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not know the person .
I only know that there was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and finally woke up in the hospital .
apparently some women had everything to get along and started to scre@@ am .
the man had fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two sore wounds in my right lung .
OC Media : in which case were you laid - in which of the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and laid me among the women .
I am very grateful for that .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for being respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
in February I received threats .
they called upon me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they asked to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all was a lie .
they made absurd demands : some told me that I had to prove it by running up without the streets ; others wanted me to appear in the official television in Gros@@ ny saying that I had not changed my gender , that all was only bad talk , and Phot@@ os@@ hop .
I have size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to handle this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still difficult for them .
some elderly people once spoke my m@@ um on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has humili@@ ated not only your family , but the whole republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too much for my mother and she lay a rope around her neck .
fortunately , the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later , a car with dark windows and a number plate with 95 on it stood under the window .
after it happened for the third time it became clear to me that something was la@@ zy .
my human rights activists checked out the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you escape ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to reveal their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something unbelievable happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought it without registering , without knowing anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked in at the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think you &apos;re safe , just because you left the country ?
our people know where to go . they even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine it ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : do you still get in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , this is a t@@ abo@@ o issue .
some traditionally Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements are still in me .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera , I really try to look at the person they remember from their past - that is , to my male form .
but this is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know anything about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have stayed dor@@ man@@ t ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for this I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who had inhal@@ ed in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he said that during Ram@@ adan , no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait and he did not exclude a new wave .
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , they probably charge the relatives , they take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has experienced genetic satisfaction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : are men still gay men held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine told me that there weren &apos;t very many .
if , above all , those who have no wealthy relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to submit to the judgment of Kad@@ y@@ row .
as far as I know , they are held there so that they can be presented as terrorists later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they had attacked some village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , they were deliberately immersed in order to radi@@ cal@@ ise themselves .
OC Media : is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was det@@ ained in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ards had grown .
there was nothing new from them ever since .
they simply took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself when these people were taken .
until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports about this yet . however , we suspect that such actions are possible .
why would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and ab@@ duc@@ tions of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already happened in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;ve always been wearing my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a bo@@ b .
I think already before 2003 I was already well known in Gro@@ z@@ ny , when I still lived there - and I never had any problems .
serious in ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was applied , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia wanted to introduce us to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately dropped us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had tin@@ ted eyel@@ ashes , wore tubes jeans and short tops .
the Ministry of Security of Sh@@ aria has never even bent my hair .
in front of the Russian theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several banks were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been insul@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da@@ ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Scot@@ s@@ man not over the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is often said to be children , when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted nor beaten .
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov came up with the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began talking on television about morality .
he spoke not about us per se , but above all about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how people started to change in the city .
those who had previously laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed at once looked at you with suspicion .
in time , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the republic getting worse .
OC Media : what activity do you do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I earn not much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
apart from that I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organise te@@ ac@@ re@@ es , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards .
I have no c@@ ents for this .
I discovered these people myself when I cleared the flood of refuge .
I am Muslims and would like to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
so nature is , that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to prophes@@ y to you with foam in front of the mouth , that there are no ga@@ ys in them .
the Da@@ gest@@ an have which , the cab@@ ar@@ ins have , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant to hear something like that .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
do you know many think about transi@@ ent to men who love men , and they believe that you are changing your sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different types of feeling to be precise , different attitudes of life .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
whether I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I will be so personally here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am myself now .
local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last few months there has been a sharp rise in suicide .
the Arab workers &apos; photo in Iran was made available by the Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran that is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability of his family to arise , so Ah@@ ra@@ zi &apos;s human rights groups who work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video shared by YouTube held the moments after he had lighted himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the inc@@ iner@@ ations were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others hang@@ ed Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fa@@ ders who felt hel@@ pless and in@@ capable of feeding their families and pursuing a safe job because of the persecution of the Iranian government .
Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi is suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region in which most of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi communities living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to make a living .
a century ago , the Arab ancest@@ or was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy took power and in 1925 under@@ took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and most valuable usable areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population only has little to do with this wealth .
it is often the victim of untreated illnesses , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime systematically den@@ ies the Ah@@ ra@@ zi Arabs to work in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government also built a large number of dam@@ s , which diver@@ t water from the Arabic regions to the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are surrounding .
these dam@@ s have only led to devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ ks increased to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director for co@@ operatives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ ra@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job , completed primary school , 55 % completed a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist based in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ ra@@ zi men .
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans emerging in Ah@@ wa@@ z and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
since officials and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers , local Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside their homeland of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their first name and sur@@ name in order to hide their affili@@ ation with the Ah@@ ra@@ zi and to be hired because even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone the speech of the Arabic language or the wearing of Arabian clothing .
given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi must endure , human rights activists attack alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; why I don &apos;t identify with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ alism &quot;
photos taken by Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published by CC@@ 0 Creative Com@@ mons License .
the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the A@@ fro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as website .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say I &apos;m not a feminist , many women - especially white women , who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - are frustr@@ ated .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well @-@ thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all feminine girls .
for example , women today earn less money than men despite equal education .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and soci@@ etal standards still make sure that women come across a glass ceiling sooner or later in different areas of life , and that discrimination based on gender is still cross the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is known and known to me .
I am convinced that I suffer twice and thre@@ ef@@ old among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet : when I come to terms of colour , on rac@@ ism , on black women &apos;s women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; when I mention whi@@ ch@@ ever way we have been ab@@ used physically , emotion@@ ally and verb@@ ally , both in and out of the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists choose to remain silent .
but all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift their voices up and sing &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; to achieve equality ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to say that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist @-@ motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in tw@@ o@@ fold ways .
or that black women and women of other ethnic groups and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of all skin color to have the same rights ; on the other hand , as a black woman , I cannot join a movement , in whose centre the white woman stands , who refuses to take into account injusti@@ ces in her thinking , which relate to both sex and skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere , which has always and again rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 51 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a men@@ ial and margin@@ alized being in a historical sense . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropri@@ ation to advance their ego@@ centric programme .
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overl@@ apping skin color and gender . some of them will continue to keep silent on the importance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them a better .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different origins a home and distinguish themselves from the white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I prefer to release myself fully and completely from femin@@ ism and to join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of using myself for a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ anism : Rec@@ la@@ iming &quot; ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we rec@@ la@@ im ourselves ) speaks of how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves on our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces where they are perfectly safe and where the spiritual , mental , physical and even spiritual elements can be worshipped , which make up the black woman .

p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on international efforts to solve environmental problems .
in the context of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again .
Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled again and again in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern for the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary of E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Water@@ sports Iraq &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - a subsidiary of Water@@ Guard Alliance , which is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq and supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work on a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and edited by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , an Er@@ bil @-@ based documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist .
the focus of her work is on persecuted , un@@ observed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of collaborative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , whose help supp@@ ressed municipalities can tell their stories in their own way .
Paraguay &apos;s women and their difficult fight against violence

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ tural . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ lich@@ in@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) reporting on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed for the protection of affected persons .
a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had become violent against her .
since the end of their relationship , some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
when another wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed up for mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez &apos; informed ad did not use anything .
a few days later , the second wife returned her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
in general , when women submit a report , they generally do not receive any support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence have to report to the law enforcement authorities .
content 1 Stri@@ ps and Statistics 2 In@@ visible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that does not under@@ line Paraguay &apos;s laws : good approach , poor implementation impacts and statistics
it is hard to find out how many women are really ab@@ used , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a social science research institution in Paraguay .
the available numbers , however , are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , 9@@ 600 cases of domestic violence were reported by the District At@@ tor@@ ney General . 70 % of these were violence against women .
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5,000 signs of domestic violence in peace courts . 86 % of women &apos;s ads came here as well .
in the advertisements , 40 % of women said they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of mental abuse .
these statistics , however , do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ardi , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; for every woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay because of mental mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment 9 women who do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two women who do not do this are coming to any woman who does not want to do so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the crime of women in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ence , the law enforcement authorities cannot appropriately document how many women are murdered each year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 , journalists included at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country .
the human rights coordinator in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , every ten days a woman died in Paraguay because of violence by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system that does nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but gave up . this should be regre@@ t@@ table .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red the psychological violence in his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognis@@ able :
I never thought I would be a victim of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that only women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse carried out by Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote posts on Facebook where she described her insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever had lifted his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had failed for so long by Carlos and didn &apos;t leave him before .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had a certain complic@@ ity .
Victoria San@@ tos , who does not come from Paraguay , fought with the authorities in Paraguay for almost eight years to prove that their former partner mi@@ stre@@ ated them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the Network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) consisting of women who are all victims of abuse in any way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case , everything began with mental mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
her aff@@ lu@@ ent partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
Victoria &apos;s ads with the authorities stayed with no results and also from their relatives , she received no support .
she led a trial against her former partner who developed into an un@@ predictable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country , mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ay@@ an laws : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good but are not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
a draft law was discussed in the Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament on 10 August 2016 , which was announced under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # feared ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non@@ natives ) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law fores@@ ees that Fem@@ Ã izi@@ d should be declared an independent criminal off@@ ence and to punish harder as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the wording of the bill was changed in some points in order to also gain members for the law , which feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions was denied , which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and pun@@ ish@@ able with up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill had intended to pay the bulk of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) process costs , which the victims of violence currently have to bear , if they just want to report and receive a secure accommodation , to impose the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as a part of inter@@ personal relationships .
a re@@ thinking must take place here , so that violence is no longer considered a normal thing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who is silent in the face of these facts is complic@@ it and contributes to the fact that the perpetr@@ ators are power@@ less . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to report so long until mal@@ treatment is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an sen@@ ate . before , parts of the law had been changed , but a passage was cancelled , among other things , which the partners in cases of domestic violence called for reconciliation .
opinions on the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the submission of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from parts of the law , however , is regarded as a great set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media in Oman a year after the ban of a newspaper continues to attack attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked because of the decision of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be read on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Israeli authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper of Az@@ am@@ n because of its reporting on corruption in the sul@@ t@@ ant .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison where he served a one @-@ year prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and tried , but later released .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after he had set off his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat .
since then , in addition to his role as the only sul@@ tan , the chief ministers of the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Defence , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the sul@@ tan &apos;s rule is characterised by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular domestic intelligence , civil liber@@ ties , including freedom of the press , to restrict and in@@ timi@@ date and in@@ timi@@ date human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , from expressing their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in public authorities and institutions , both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to freedom of the press in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its inc@@ eption in 2007 about corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) was reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , noted that an article titled &quot; High @-@ ranked parties tie hands of justice &quot; in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 .
in the report , government officials were accused of pressur@@ ising judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in an inheritance dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties tie hands of justice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo source : Facebook page of Az@@ am@@ n
on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , member of the editorial committee , was invited by the ISS to the Special Department and arrested by security forces upon his arrival .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS took over the deputy chief editor You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the paper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and distribution of the paper on any way , including online , will be banned from 9 August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i took place before the court in Mas@@ kat .
the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned , among other things , for distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the Internet , &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the pres@@ tige of the state . &quot;
in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of viol@@ ating a ban on the publication of the publication and the slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of prison terms and fin@@ es of 3,000 om@@ anian ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition , a one @-@ year ban on the profession of the two journalists was imposed .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of &quot; an information network for the dis@@ semination of material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a security deposit of 5000 US dollars was set ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 before the pron@@ oun@@ cement of the sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i at a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months in prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 following his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his first @-@ year sentence .
the Appe@@ als Chamber also rev@@ oked the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n to re @-@ admit , the newspaper continues to be exposed to attacks by the Venezu@@ el@@ an government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed another order in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , giving the Minister once again the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to re@@ vo@@ ke the publication of the newspaper .
the perpet@@ ual closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which the freedom of the press was viol@@ ated in Oman in recent times .
further injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to stop its operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression is that the Korean authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of freedom of the press .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the German authorities to :
1 . un@@ condition@@ ally release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j without un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. to create a secure environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3 . protect freedom of the press in the country and
4 . to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman can exercise their ri@@ ghtful human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including judicial har@@ ass@@ ment .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighboring countries by promoting freedom of expression and association , as well as the right to gather peace , support and protect them .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , illustration takes place with his agreement
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all . it is a growing area addressing one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site : on the one hand , many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent are missing .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more serious consequences in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for resear@@ ching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
secondly , research carried out by African scientists is helping to establish own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of Central Laboratory at the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed first serious implications for national health .
he left Zambia for studying in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home in order to support the Serbian health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier talked about the future of medical research in Zambia and about the mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( disc@@ la@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . in doing so , I support the sam@@ ba national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
I am also starting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
GM : what do you think are the most important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always be recipients rather than being a maker .
the solutions we get are often not well usable in our surroundings , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GM : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are promoted differently .
it is difficult to find people who come back or move here because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries .
GV : what is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not previously have ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : how large is your view of the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it concentrate on and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special academic training starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , exploration of space , health care ( non @-@ communic@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GM : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here .
the system means that magazines are only available for payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , which also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the USA to India : how &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky originally appeared on the En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine that reports on solutions to environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding in the USA salad since the 1980s .
his company offers 114 sorts such as Out@@ lying Gor@@ geous , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited by its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many types of salads he can get .
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding .
the patents apply not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or sp@@ illed leaves .
over the past few years more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cer@@ eal or card types . due to this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a millen@@ nia old tradition , Mor@@ ton is still breeding a salad , but he needs longer since his work is increasingly difficult due to increasingly restra@@ ints .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if a b@@ oul@@ der would lie in a river to shrink . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do it now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think these patents go too far on salads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand in court , no one can breed a new sort of let@@ tu@@ ce because all the features are already patented . &quot; he continues to do as good as possible and tries to breed those features he wants .
however , he is very cau@@ tious and stri@@ ves to not use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
he also joined forces in the United States and around the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman salad of the variety Out@@ red@@ ding in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested if plants can be grown in space .

it is not by chance that this name sounds rather as if the movement originates from the IT field and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open source seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software .
it was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can be used permanently for plant breeders .
in the context of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders may undertake to use the seeds bred by them freely .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open Source &quot; breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties , and do not immediately sow - two aspects which are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
for the emer@@ itus professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg control of the seed and the possibility to grow new plants is important for food security and environmental protection .
seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would attempt to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg points out that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement does not deal with genetically modified plants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed , &quot; he says . &quot; those who want to buy good , locally and sustain@@ ably produced vegetables , such as farmers markets , should also know that the way in which this vegetables is grown is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ple@@ dge to keep seed available to others , as opposed to pat@@ enting seed and plant tra@@ its .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk because the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the growing number of intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always available .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has worked in her doctoral thesis on genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all card features are protected as intellectual property , which makes it difficult for plant breeders to be used either at all or only .
such estimates are not yet available for other plants , but experts such as Lu@@ by suggest that large @-@ scale cultivated plants such as wheat in even greater style are patented as let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots .
a question of view
plants are grown in such a way that they show desirable characteristics - from those through which their taste or colour improves up to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and sustain threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changing conditions due to climate change are much worse predic@@ able .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokesperson C@@ arly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to recognizes that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to the preservation of genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property may restrict other breeders because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent exp@@ ires . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion with another method .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , it promotes it by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mor@@ ton looks different : 20 years to wait , until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovations .
and if you have to wait so long to grow plants that are adapted to changing environmental conditions , you would have lost the fight .
but the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want farmers to make their work easier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it is impossible for us to continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all in all , Mor@@ ton is bo@@ thered by the concept of patented plant characteristics : &quot; we do not really create the features ourselves .
the plants form it themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a secret of nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US state O@@ reg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who breeds a variety , also breeds his own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , whose cultivation involves large quantities of her@@ bi@@ cides , is breeding in its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly the opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that operate on international markets but smaller than for example Mon@@ san@@ to ) have patents , they create most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case .
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mor@@ ton looks for salads at his breeding garden .

Mor@@ ton is also convinced that breeders should be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent .
I always need new material for my catalog , since I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years themselves , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent they have been protected for 20 years from competition , which makes it very easy for my opinion . &quot; worldwide resonance
although the US seems to be a leader in open source breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly throughout the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed program . to preserve the seeds of traditional crops , the Centre works with farmers and helps them breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organization Agre@@ ements works on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i obligation for breeders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( rules for breeding differ from country to country , so the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot be easily adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able , thus contradic@@ ting the current practice of the European Patent Office which allows patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to implement the Patent Office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on open source seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards seed pat@@ enting .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for open source seed systems for which next year the official launch of the seed should fall .
an association of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food , has published a report on aid organizations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others . it believes farmers have the opportunity to come to seed , exchange and improve seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured .
the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a diverse local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a context that Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon see him .
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has largely taken care of where and how something is cultivated , and seed systems have hardly played a role here , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the newest goals of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities are still blocking content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of 5 August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August , the network published an opinion on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ised for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains faithful to its goal to uncover the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , to uncover the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it has never been as important as it is now . AN@@ H@@ RI affir@@ ms that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome and not im@@ part . we ins@@ ist on fulfilling our task .
AN@@ H@@ RI is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Arab @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar @-@ based network of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era due to alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation belonging to the wave of website barriers . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in the Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI , the blog of colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no more access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the distribution of columns and articles that he writes for websites and media that are not accessible in Egypt .
now the blog , which he directed to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , became the target of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider with which also Zi@@ ada &apos;s blog is given a home , on the other hand is more accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , reporting on the student protests and recording a video , as the police practiced physical violence against two students .
his articles revol@@ ve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him :
to lock the blo@@ gs is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even though blocking the blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) They succeeded in giving me the feeling of a state of siege , an arrest , a attempted murder , a sum@@ mons to the National Security Council , the blocking blo@@ gs , and any other web site for which I worked .
2 ) They have shown that I did not write for nothing in vain . in other words , my words have influence if only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to post articles in order to circum@@ vent cens@@ orship .
but now , after blocking him and that they &apos;re afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave ones walk the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities blocked websites from 24 May to 06 August . this resulted in technical tests on the networks of different Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and ET@@ IS@@ A@@ LA@@ T .
af@@ te also documented the closure of providers , which was possible through the transfer of internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12th we noticed how the blocking of web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer began .
such a practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content to which Egyptian users could have access .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is also wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that decision @-@ making decisions are made behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which they can proceed against these acts in court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in the war ?
the inhabitants argue .

newspapers in Brazil are reporting every day with glo@@ omy news from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 years old in school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is assass@@ inated , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves smoke a pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air sea to Rio . &quot;
in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the 2017 wave of violence reached the highest level for 10 years in Rio .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice also called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio , the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; published the editorial &quot; This is not normal &quot; in which she announced to set up a new column called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the newspaper explained the motives for their decision like this :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every big city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . everything , however , devi@@ ates from the civil@@ ised standard and what happens only in Rio is published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , stated that this decision was not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper in the world with a war break in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist tells the newspaper that there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro .
in the editorial , the newspaper writes :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware that a war discourse , if distorted , can also be used to hide atro@@ cities of the police who are only shooting and then asking questions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
in an article published in the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira ar@@ gues that the violence as a &quot; war &quot; ar@@ gues . this is in their opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold account@@ ability in the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated by the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ent neg@@ lect of public service .
remember : the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than just its capital .

calling Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; is false according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are in the north and northeast of the country according to statistics of 2015 . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date available data .
none of these cities are in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ ates pro state , Rio is on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 16 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Glob@@ o , the largest media corporation in South America , has been a member of the state &apos;s largest media enterprise , which , like Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years .
the creation of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit imposed by the state of Rio in 2003 , is one of these security policy measures .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . for some years , the U@@ PP was increasingly under fire after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities , which the newly created police unit was supposed to protect .
on his Facebook page journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles from 2010 , explaining why the violence in Rio does not meet the criteria defined by the Geneva Convention for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the gra@@ ding of the situation in Rio as a war also causes serious consequences for people .
this calls for the state to use means and ways typical of war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civilian is an in@@ significant point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost balls . &quot;
war back or forth , the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio .
one week it is time for the police to get up the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a vendor died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : teach Syri@@ ans to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege in Damascus and Sur@@ ro@@ unding , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b .
the region of East Gh@@ out@@ a , where chemical weapons attack on 21 August 2013 called for hundreds of civilians , is particularly affected .
many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition go out , based on studies by the United Nations and other human rights organizations that the massacre of the Assad regime has been committed .
since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege , leading to the fact that local residents are dependent on locally produced or smu@@ g@@ gled foodstuffs .
thanks to the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and ac@@ adem@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own fung@@ i as a &quot; life saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and perform the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods grown in Syria and are rarely part of Syrian cuisine . however , their food is an attractive food source for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the Direc@@ tly of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; we chose to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and wa@@ iters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports global Vo@@ ices , who has been fighting for three years to announce this project and expressed its relief that it is becoming more and more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gaining popularity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ DO in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to give 125 families knowledge of planting mushrooms , says Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached more than 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to raise funds to Can@@ do by Monday , the 4th of September 2017 .
the initiative relies on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel shortage , locally produced fuels are made of plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said , Global Vo@@ ices , that they started the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of mushrooms from the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . when this was done , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms anywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people mushroom cultivation for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : break of siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source in the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food residue ( such as paper , tea , coffee extract , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women working at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities tied to their homes .
he said : &quot; we hope to spread this idea around the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege is visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experiences to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese call for justice for the victims of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested in many district capital cities in Portugal on 21 October , demanding justice for victims of fires that were ramp@@ ant in the northern part of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires on October 15 and 16 . this led to the government to call out a state shower last week for solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gali@@ cia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 bur@@ sts spread out in the northern and central regions of the country and reached some 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy oc@@ cured in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded .
according to the European forest monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite photographs , approximately 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can get a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire only in 4 districts .

numerous videos spread across the network and show images that allow for better insights into what is happening :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was unable to cur@@ b the scale of the tragedy as far as possible
Jo@@ Ã£o Sover@@ al from the Bund der Far@@ mers of Portugal declared the paper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this : there are dozens of reports of open roads surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could have happened in June as the streets were blocked very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned .
a far @-@ reaching proposal on the reform of the forest , introduced by the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed construction activity to fall if the applicant had a means of self @-@ protection - that was an open backdoor so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ Ã£o Sor@@ val continued in the same article of the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organisation Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees of easily inflamm@@ able wood , spread like in a vi@@ cious circle , after fires of this type .
to these problems , the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15th and 16th , when people sought information or attempted to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided information to the population : it took advantage of its own civil protection data with the application fo@@ g@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was critical at this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers were not able to withstand the rush of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the site counted more than half a million acc@@ esses .
even the founder asked for help :

at this time , A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , sat together with his family at dinner for the last time in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan .
even if his mother didn &apos;t say so at that time , she knew she would no longer see her son - maybe even more .
at dawn the boy was supposed to break up .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the H@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Tali@@ ban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt vulnerable .
the Tali@@ ban , well @-@ known for their hatred , came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his flight , A@@ shar@@ k found himself in Pakistan again .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . his work was hard and made him ill .
then he took what was left of his low wages , and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country with other refugees and dra@@ gged bags with mortar which were harder than himself to make a living .
back then , as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the site we were working on .
there were no services and no heating . we hung nylon in front of the open windows , so that we could not freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without documents in Iran and was ready to travel to Europe .
in the dangerous crossing of the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his application for asylum , A@@ shar@@ k arrived in Italy in 2002 .
some time , A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , fell asleep in parks and went to a church distributing food to the needy twice a day .
it is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high population quot@@ as . however , it is true that the conditions that asylum seekers are finding in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special recording centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised bodies in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can be drawn up for months after the registration of the asylum application .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
and so did A@@ shar@@ af too .
but his uncertain li@@ fest@@ yles helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions very soon .
after several years of working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ k put his entire savings into the creation of a host@@ els in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ per Bar@@ atis success story is now subject of the documentary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) by director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was presented for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to in@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the road to other European countries .
over the past few years , some Afgh@@ ans have ar@@ isen , including tailor shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff were mainly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pa@@ dua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ a &apos;s targets extend far beyond the Italian gastronomy trade and the retail sector and aim to return to the country that he had forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where there is a risk , there are opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily , if I know that my people are suffering .
I am planning a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces in the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ per also for@@ ges plans to open a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this way , they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end stability and prosperity are at the end .
he has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
citizen Report : legal dra@@ fts from Egypt allow shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , in detention for more than 900 days .
he reported the clearance of the camp &apos; Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , prot@@ esting against the suspension of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen @-@ Report is an international snapshot that shows challenges , wins and upcoming trends in global Internet rights
the Egyptian parliament has reviewed a draft bill that fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government authority .
users need to register to use the social networks within six months of the successful legal decision on the authority &apos;s website stating their full name and ID number .
those who miss this step could be sentenced to up to six months of prison sentence or a pen@@ al punishment .
the law , which was applied by sixty members of parliament , is currently facing the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
in May , another member of the Bundestag filed a legislative proposal to introduce more severe pen@@ alties for the insul@@ t of the president or to a senior official .
under the law proposition , however , such a deed would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , according to legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law is passed , this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the defend@@ ants .
in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy for many years .
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian polic@@ emen , demonstrating force against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the inauguration of elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting for four years in prison for more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested at the same incident .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May because the prison management failed to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room according to human rights groups .
Sha@@ w@@ kan faces the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , apparent pollution of inter alia , weapons possession , illegal gathering , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iz@@ a released the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si sitting block at the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the Court also reduced the sanctions of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ fak@@ res@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunisi@@ an activ@@ ist inter@@ rog@@ ated on le@@ aked documents
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ res@@ bia , who is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ res@@ bia &apos;s plan was chi@@ ef@@ ly inter@@ rog@@ ated by the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , explicitly supports a controversial draft law that would guarantee business people and former regimes by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided that these funds returned illeg@@ ally .
the document published on April 21 on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at th@@ rows a light on how the presidential plans to support the bill of law look like .
Ben G@@ res@@ bia decl@@ ines the nom@@ ination of his sources under Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an Press Code , which sec@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he appeared in the Regional Court in Tunis on May 09 as a witness .
does China want to force the users of social media to present their identification ?
according to the new rules of the information offices of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need permission before they write or share news in social media .
the rules also indicate that registration will be necessary with full real name .
analysts suspect that this will allow the elimination of anonymous comments within social networks . it is not clear until now how the authorities will apply these regulations .
Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to enforce these regulations only sel@@ ectively , in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
then do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ ado , We@@ Chat failed to register with the state government as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Organis@@ er of Information Diff@@ usion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this term is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that organise the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also makes it possible for the government to make up @-@ to @-@ date services for removing content and to force them to susp@@ end user data .
these websites currently include websites such as V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ class@@ ni@@ ks ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court decre@@ es ban Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered the Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia &apos;s administrators refused to er@@ ase two English @-@ language articles , the information that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication informed that the site was closed because it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an information source that co@@ operates with groups to create a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked its website . it is , among other things , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
great Britain can &apos;t stop to s@@ nu@@ ggle up
after this week , the British government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communication in real time and install Backdoor programs that de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and secret services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population on the outside .
despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and suggestions by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .
