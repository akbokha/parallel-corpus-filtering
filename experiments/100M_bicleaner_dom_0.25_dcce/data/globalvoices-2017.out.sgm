<seg id="1">Although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012, I would live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and operated his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was primarily a journalist because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played Gray Grantham in The Pelican Brief, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts as a Jura student, uncovered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free to Method Man," "" "I was as if that was the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only intensified.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose variety is so inviting that you can always be who you are, and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very blackened love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then came Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never keeps his mind behind the mountain, as one says so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague put it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, the people responded to his statements and voted in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican primaries was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever reached.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters to the people I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism programme, which receives people from all over the world, a deep devout person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, Trumps did not agree with Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the Phoenix Suns in the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, she fights the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me and my colleagues with a lot of patience and grace to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love of America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump took his way to the nominated republican presidential candidate they offered me a foothold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">It turned out, however, that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly whites, gave the presidency to a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to designate the trump-voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">Arranging people, one of my friends said, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom know, voted for Trump, because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commentates on the cruel decision to lift a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "whitelash" (OB.): as much as "rebellion against all other ethnic groups"; word play from white in allusion to the white and whiplash, as the great Van Jones called, has killed just what America has made so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world value the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan whose history, as he himself says, would never be possible anywhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the White America's promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole notion of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">At a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd responded with a loud" "" "no!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"do Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "the crowd roared." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried and their voices became louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "would anyone who is not like you, have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son was pleased sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "this is now trumps country," "" "said the news." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan could no longer find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="66">From the misery to the stars: these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music through rubbish</seg>
<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What did the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community have in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the Paraguaan city of Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music played at both places has not only changed the lives of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is at the edge of a large landfill site, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town, which is very popular among tourists, but worlds apart from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now La banda de Música (music band) plays in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, located in one of the poorest province of Mexico, is known for its abuse of drugs and the violence of the gangs.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a chance encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth thus offered a rare glimmer of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always arrive laughingly and with shiny eyes and play in the hustle you learn day by day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, Bongos and the Conga to play.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura - a village located practically at the top of the biggest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - are based on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reconditioned instruments consisting of local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under the direction of Favio Chávez have begun to turn parts of waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">Instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, contrabasses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums, all made out of the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin-American music as well as music of the Beatles, from Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article from the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local economist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, remembers:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in garbage. children didn't know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a trash produced by trash.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments from reprocessed material and is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary named "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">Every year, the world generates about one billion tons of rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Fill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries demonstrate how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that reports on international, practised solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for the joint use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known then that this ship had already caught illegal fishing in the Liberian waters before it was investigating the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly upset about this and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this species on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to hire one of their ports and refused to grant them a permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused to do anything," "" "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior officer of the Kenyan fisheries authority. he is part of a team who discovered and persecuted the ship at his time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: he was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to pillaging fish stocks in the country.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which sects criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal Fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">Apart from Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that the Prime Minister had expelled from their waters at that time.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries who are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and stand at each other where it comes to illegal fishing" "", "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust project" "" "Ending Illegal Fishing." "" "this project offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, and therefore it is extremely difficult to detect. this makes illegal fishing a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to the deliberate violation of existing laws through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail empathy, with the information between individual countries, actions happen in real time, with traceability to FISH-i's digital communications platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, the individual countries can exchange for example lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also carefully monitors the activities of ships when they move on the open sea using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This makes it possible for the authorities to identify ships fishing in forbidden areas - such as those that indicate that a ship charges its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the involved vessels have a fishing licence, where they were on the road and possibly also whether they have a criminal law.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries which are against illegal fishing may then refuse to accept such ships in their ports, which means that ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then there is considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worth the money." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that is what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, managing director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm who advocates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue, which the eight members of the HISH-i network are losing each year because of illegal fishermen who invade East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from around the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include, among others, actions such as sailing under false flag, falsified license documents, imaginary names, fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an uninterrupted control system," "" "says Long." "" "in the past, a ship could fish illegally and a country could say" "" "You mustn't run my port" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "yet another country could say" "" "Come to Me" "" "and this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now, the closed front has been working.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 suspicious vessels.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that spread falsified royalties in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has tracked and found fleeing vessels.</seg>
<seg id="128">FISH-i is able to share and maintain information on illegal fishing across great distances due to its co-operation with INTERPOL, the international authorities for combating crime.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime" "", "Bergh says." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps detect the illegal vessels that would like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "we try to cross," "" "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO who also deals with fisheries data and offers technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps build a system that connects different levels of information. it is designed to help FISH-i to find criminals with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations really influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, president of NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has jointly opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oceana Sea Protection Organisation: a platform that provides satellite data and displays the position of every single trackable vessel in the world.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "coming together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what - that simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and to pool their resources." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "" "" "we should do this at a global level." "" "" "" "ew Charitable Trusts has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detain criminals, but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that used to fish previously without a license and had hardly any consequences, now know they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i are now seeing a 33% increase in fisheries sales since fishing boats buy more licences.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i had helped Somalia to track down Greko 1, the inspectors on board found trawl nets which were banned.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "we have become a subject of study." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="148">"" "in 2015 six countries have joined forces, called the West Africa Task Force. they too combat illegal fishing, according to the exact same model as FISH-i." "" "With certainty, the goal is to make even more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions," "" "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's latest member country Somalia was able to report its first big triumph: in October, there was Greko 1, a ship under the false flag. and not only did the ship travel without a license and were used trawl nets which are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also penetrated into forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "taking measures against Greko 1 marked a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing," "" "Bergh says." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time proof that such a special collaborative working method for the protection of the oceans actually works in the whole world sea.

<seg id="153">The street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the impeachment of President Nicolás Maduro.</seg>
<seg id="155">This picture of María Aljandra Mora shows a close-up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the Venezuelan government rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on impeachment, the Venezuelans reacted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country fell into emptiness by gathering on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the refund of Venezuela) both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - among others in the Barinas lowland area, in the Andean regions Mérida and Táchira, in the centrally located Carabobo Bundestate and the Margarita Island in the Federal State of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country is deteriorating continuously, which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezuelans through an acute lack of food and medicines.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw in the inauguration of the current President Nicolás Maduro an opportunity for a fundamental change; in the end, however, the holding of a new election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, co-founder of Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">As part of the social, political and economic crisis in which the inflation and violence rates are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% for the annual financial statements) and in which a serious and far-reaching lack of food and medicine exists, the referendum in favour of many is the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The protesters called Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or MUD (for example: round table of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups joined forces. in addition, a twelve-hour strike on the following day and a march to the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan Government seat, were to continue to block the referendum on impeachment.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call has been commented on Twitter as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is as far as Venezuela: morning National Assembly, Friday nationwide civil fight and on 3 November all to Caracas to the Miraflores Palace.</seg>

<seg id="176">On Twitter, pictures that talk about confrontations, as well as reports of oppression and abuse.</seg>
<seg id="177">Especially large waves broke the news about police repression in the centrally located town of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">There, the demonstrators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves against the police and armed advocates of the government according to their own statement.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they could safely leave the cathedral, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop the police, including this woman in the Andean state Táchira:</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in Táchira don't wear coats because you could see something that many national Guards don't have!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic makes the round showing the amount of repression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has suppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the call for an impeachment procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="185">Mytek's Media Labs:</seg>
<seg id="186">Nicolás and Diosdado are claiming that 1% of the signatures are falsified.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here is your impeachment!</seg>

<seg id="189">Others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government, which, from its point of view, did little against the devastating economic crisis and would rather have occupied critical voices:</seg>
<seg id="190">They took us so much - but also the fear!</seg>
<seg id="191">The marches always increase in frequency and intensity.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, who was published on 23 August 2016 at Día a Día, an Argentinian news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to view the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinian city of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano now spoke against his father as part of the great La Perla Ribera trial in the province of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinian military dictatorship were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden of wearing the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the prison of La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the family secret for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time I believed that it was okay.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child of 15 years, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not realize that my father was a thief, a torturer and a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis Alberto Quijano had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was a gendarmermaid. during the Argentinian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in prison La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Archive recording.</seg>
<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor who is accused of kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10 year old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanus's son, a man who, over the years, recognized the extent of the atrocities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a path of redemption.</seg>
<seg id="215">From sports hall to military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall with us. there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translate, you need two important abilities: passive language skills to understand the starting text and to use active language skills to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active command of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their mother tongue, who could make translations into English. this may be due to a lack of understanding of translation, cost reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers that learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who do not have foreign employees themselves, can still make translations within the company. then, the Japanese employee, whose knowledge of English is considered the best, is made a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The verbs and enigmatic sentences created by machine translations show that this technique can't replace any human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the enigmatic imprints often adorning T-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery. but by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more accurate translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "Navegar con Libertad" (free surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute of Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the websites of VPITV and El Capitolio TV are no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online broadcasters have also recorded footage of the protests in Caracas, organized by opposition groups that oppose the government of Nicolás Maduro.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began in early April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the findings of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was clipped and recommended users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to access the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Censorship: activate your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that the Venezuelan ISPs internet pages are locked again.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the @ Vivoplaylist page.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular with the Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media has been hesitant in reporting about protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission for Telecommunications threatened them with fines and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as a "call to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national television channels, I registered again at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">It is amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfiltro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible by blocking the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two more online channels. this also applies to the Internet site where the National Assembly communicates its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Past investigations by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technology that uses DNS servers to answer requests for certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server responds poorly or refuses to request such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNA lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third sealed channel, the broadcast was suspended on Thursday 6 April, when the VPITV camera man Elvis Flores, who transmitted the protests in Caracas, was arrested.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later, he was released, and VPIZ returned to the show again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it has also been reported that the government regulates Internet connections: this makes the Venezuelans more difficult to access multimedia reporting on current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house proudly spoke about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "the one who has become something," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga has never been treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old, she started working as a criadita for the family. Criadita means that in Paraguay there are more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money hands over their underage son or their underage daughter to another, rich family.</seg>
<seg id="424">What is not mentioned, however, is that the children have to pay for countless days of housework, which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this under a contract that cannot be lifted.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice, described as Criadazgo, is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After completing her studies, Alvarenga worked for a number of years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criadita - especially young girls affected by the Criadazgo practice - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call things by name, because the feeling of gratitude which is inoculated by the Criadita guarantees in general silence.</seg>

<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family, who is their daughter in the belief that they are completing their education, can improve their position in society and "make something out of themselves" can be handed over to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family who takes the girl with her and justifies her exploitation with the faith that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and maybe even starved.</seg>

<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín was hospitalized in Caaguazú, her body showed signs of violent shocks. shortly thereafter she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military member Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as an official at the Population Register.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small village with just 3.000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital of Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira arrived at Marín as long as she suffered lethal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later, the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organisations such as UNICEF or Callescuela attributed the practice of Criadazgo to the death of the girl deeply rooted in the Paraguayan society.</seg>
<seg id="445">"" "they described the Criadazgo as" "" "a modern form of slavery." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest rallies and called for "no other Carolina" to be in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely used in social media.</seg>

<seg id="449">Without papers, it is much easier to violate the rights of children without impunity.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organizations called for a speedy investigation into the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was their Criadita.</seg>

<seg id="454">The Life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criadita are not only exploited as labour power, they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, in which her father worked, had to register bankruptcy and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to go all the way and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita to the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of her employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She rose every morning at five o'clock and prepared breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">Fridays, for example, cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was over, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The sooner she finished learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because they had to do dinner for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but didn't get too much food. "I was allowed to get more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge," she recalls.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well-equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizer of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">At some evenings the host Alvarenga forced him to stand next to him and read editorial from opposition papers such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to convince them not to believe in the reports of the official media about the dictator's regime.</seg>
<seg id="471">He kept her intelligently, but did not entertain her. "the host had found someone who listened while he talked about politics," she says.</seg>
<seg id="472">"they didn't often allow me to visit my family because they thought I would like to learn" bad habits "again. so they thought that Alvarenga, who belongs to the indigenous group of Guaraní, would speak again at home their native language Guaraní.</seg>
<seg id="473">Their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible.</seg>
<seg id="474">But she was completely clear that she had paid for everything she got from them, with her hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also in school Alvarenga was discriminated against. "one thing about which is almost never talked about is mobbing and the chicanes that Criadita are exposed to when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anybody to my home. I didn't have a circle of friends in school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, in the time when friendships arise, I felt particularly clear that I was not part of any group.</seg>

<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six paragraphs and curses in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice, video surveillance and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is not clear how the law is enforced when it is adopted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose the registration. it is not clear how they should identify those who do not register considering the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School to Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by the tsunami on 11 March 2011 and still the region is occupied with reconstruction.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo, the head of Japan's northeast of Japan, documented the progress achieved over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "threefold catastrophe" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an nuclear accident in Fukushima had caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in the prefecture of Miyagi. the prefecture of Miyagi was a state prefectural in Japan's northeast which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring councils Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate, as the tsunami had lost entire coastal cities from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">The Fukushima prefecture had an atomic accident, and 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone.</seg>
<seg id="548">The Kahoku Shimpo's special report shows the progress made six years later in order to rebuild the local residents' lives.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the paper includes both statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority and the results of the survey results.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing construction in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare houses (no concern to be met) were completed in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was able to record the greatest success among the three prefectures, where 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima forms the final light with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">At the same time, six years after the catastrophe, evacuation of temporary shelters (also to be carried out, casetsu juchaku) should be relocated into final spare houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the three-way catastrophe, almost 80 000 people were forced to live in temporary shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate still lived in such dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the people evacuated from Fukushima in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful here. more than 75 percent of the evacuates, who suffered after the disaster in temporary shelters, were resettled into final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the figure here is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has been able to determine, 1074 of 1,100 schools affected by misfortune have opened its doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later it is clear that industrial rebuilding in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 percent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are in operation again, only 30 percent of the fishing harbours have resumed their operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident have spread extensively in the three prefectures of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 per cent of the arable land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed arable land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed arable land from Fukushima lie in the "nuclear lock zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but Fukushima is still lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only show 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it feels more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to be able to determine an overall picture, the newspaper has conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuates. she questioned her about the state of reconstruction and how her empathy towards the tsunami risk has changed.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami consciousness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents took measures to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents find that still not enough is done in disaster prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">As for those who had to be evacuated from Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue of the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has increasingly focused its attention on the situation of the evacuates from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to experience not only the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was also witness to the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuates from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were displaced in areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 some more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, were resettled into permanent spare houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the 2017 status, more than 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima live outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas most of the evacuates, who are still in Behelfswald, are older than 50 years old. they are well known because the efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima must compete with massive construction projects.</seg>

<seg id="583">When you meet people from other countries that speak another language, the differences seem to be greater than the common ones.</seg>

<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, the social sciences at the University of Goiás, has suffered a skull trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated on this Saturday and now put him in an artificial coma.</seg>

<seg id="599">The local image journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which quickly spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a strike. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of Goiás announced that Sampaio had been suspended from active service until the end of the investigation of the incident.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officer how he strikes in Goiânia with his stick on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer was beaten by a demonstrator and landing on the intensive care unit, his face would be on TV for six months and the entire repression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desoxygenador," a press channel by media activists from Goiânia, shared the video recorded by Luiz da Luz on the web, in which one sees how Mateus is attacked by the police officer and several paramedics come to him shortly afterwards.</seg>

<seg id="625">The Uncharted Villages in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of Álvaro Reynoso's law, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories all over Cuba joined the doors (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayenabeque, is generally known as el Central - a Spanish sugar mill, notwithstanding the fact that there is no significant sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralysed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After receipt, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the frame of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the job.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and swung to the factories every day.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier-veteran, who rises every day at 4: 00 o'clock in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which after a long inactive time are in operation because they were received.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene seems to have heard exactly that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">Sugar cane industry already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, poor administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016 production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the volume produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are no more news.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the church saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically obsolete, and hardly competitive they were unsustainable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target amounted to 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">"" "from 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 report" "" "Agricultural Research" "" "by the OECD and FAO, the UN Agricultural and Food Organization." ""</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will certainly go down in history," "" "these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on October 21, 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the shutdown of a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people, received their full salaries for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez has worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">When Nene, as he is known as a soldier, about the closure of the factory, is the word he repeats most, "scam."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents were of the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first closing year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was the official written documents that only differed in terms of the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the Minister could approve of any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was postponed and the letters became more and more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the abandoned factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation," he assures.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, waits for retirement in another plant called Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in the shutdown of the factory in which he helped build.</seg>
<seg id="667">With each part he removed, he disassembled one of his 31 working years.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do it through hip-hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile audio studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were conducted by the teacher David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked with ten Cree communities in North Quebec and then worked together with the Cree Hip-Hop-Group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">"" "the workshop is growing so that the young participants explore topics such as" "" "cultural identity, language, engagement, love, self acceptance" "" "or whatever comes to mind." ""</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are the inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in the State of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the territory of the trunk of the Kitsumcalum First Nation in British Columbia relates, for example, the history of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a street section in western Canada, where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people were not always familiar with the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the refrain is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved here received some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars hip-hop group, who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available in transcript, as well as a translation into English translated into German here:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day you will hear our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because as a youth we have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise up someday</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">This is how they can grow and move forward as well as our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">This is how they can do what the Creator has ordained</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan, plastic dishes can be seen almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, near the entrance shokuhin spuru (no need to be done, "plastic models of dishes") are displayed by any food served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers are looking at these plastic dishes and then decide whether they will enter or go on the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the tokiotic part of Kappabashi, there are a large number of these small companies that manufacture those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend is turning them into showy mobile accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin spuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sales: new plastic bags decorated cell phone bands, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods were turned into kitschy collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few shooters fridge magnets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food production is becoming more and more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an imperial-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was turned into a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular dish (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your cell:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is only the beginning of an increasing flight to the comical.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone stands and mobile phone designers allow you to make your own work of art. in this case, ikura or salmon roe is used, a popular topping served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there anyone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my cell phone with salmon roe?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form to surprise colleagues or family members.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and wristbands made of dried salmon.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports from domestic and foreign media on the infamous "struggle against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the mingled and killed regularly appear only in statistics. these, however, do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">The report on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the leader of the Sinaloa Cartel, pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the bereaved or on the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind each corpse, behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">For this reason, the Mexican news portal Animal Político called on the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "living with drug trafficking"), telling these victims a voice and telling stories of people who have been involved in the struggle between law enforcement authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime can not only fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "a video entitled" "" "Vivique Cambian por el miedo" "" "(German:" "" "how fear life" "" ") tells these stories." ""</seg>

<seg id="774">"" "" "" "we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and the leadership of the state." ""</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this contribution from Taxco, in the federal state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that we should never consider violence as normal, no matter in what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known illness and sensational journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">Every day I come to newspaper kiosks and see the front pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from academics of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the composure.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel like I am the only person who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to that body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this to be normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin insists that he wants to become Narco (German: drug traffickers) if he is big. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic deeds" of offenders when they walk through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridiculed those who have lost somebody and those who are afraid that something will happen to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the inaction of man is incredible for me when the death of six people and the enforced disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified by the fact that they were" "" "diligent." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to convince that they are spared from such tragedies when they are not stirring and still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. of Mexico City wrote the article "Four months blackmail in the capital district: how a family was looted by threats." in this it describes how armed criminal month paid money from their business month by month until they had destroyed not only the business, but also torn their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain on it never passes, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We will only contact you if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, for they don't know when they will kidnap or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days, whether wines would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I must learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "the journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the report" "" "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation of violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing wife and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it possible to grow up in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age whose parents care for them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a orphan and tells him he had to teach himself how to cook a egg, roast potatoes, tortillas warm and make "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood had passed two years ago when he saw only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody corpse of his father, who was shot by armed men out of a driving car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez was like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, as violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Councillor for Public Safety and Government of the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor's office numbered 3103 murders. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 million per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines, but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprating a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal Político launched the data journalism project "Narcodata," whose aim is to portray the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking that has tormented the country in the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="818">The factcheck is important in a moment when it comes to lifting up a rumor or expose a falsification.</seg>
<seg id="819">But what is the year after something has appeared for the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to insist on.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication it has been misled to portray tragedies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of picture and event - "wrong description" or "wrong context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful coverage of events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tank truck crossed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, kicked around and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war Africa's second largest country has been neglected for years and thus devastated. the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of potholes that were difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank truck fell victim to it.</seg>
<seg id="828">Authorities' representatives described a fireball rolling dozens of houses, including a movie theater near which was full of people watching the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses scattered and charred corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were incinerated to impunity.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture titled "This is Nigeria." from Imgur user Mystical Monkey, January 12, 2015.Several photos of the incident form the atrocious scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charred bodies that are strung on the ground while people look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo was held several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, but wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters from Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses dramatically reported atrocities they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one has left to count corpses," "" "said a Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">The follow-up time could only be illustrated by satellite images.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack remains unclear, but the military point in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt by Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerged from the DR Congo, as it was wrongly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">Indeed, this abusive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of false attributions; Africa Check has documented the orders of Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the picture was presented as a proof of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further, personal commentaries such as this example falsely link the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a lightning message, published by the United Nations describes those who could escape blows, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported of the violence against the Rohingya, Posts appeared like the following, which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi-Arab news page, which 2012 falsely claimed that the president of Myanmar Thein said that monks and politicians have participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate this information.</seg>
<seg id="857">The original contribution, which was last accessed on 26 April 2017, can be viewed here.</seg>
<seg id="858">Other news agencies, called AFP as their source, also falsely attributed this statement to Thein, but had not related the picture of the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="859">The global reach of false information</seg>
<seg id="860">Traces of these false coupling dates back to the years 2011 and 2012 and indeed come from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="861">With an inverted image search, you can see how far more information can cross boundaries.</seg>
<seg id="862">An inverse picture search with the searchengine TinEye has found 344 pictures (as of May 3, 2017) under 18.8 billion pictures (as of May 3, 2017), which are very similar to the said image from the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="863">They come from a mixed-mix of private pages, social media platforms and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese.</seg>
<seg id="864">Some have sent false reports, some have tried to expose the falsifications.</seg>
<seg id="865">We have restricted examples of abusive use and linked them to the respective countries on the basis of what they have been published on which side they have been published.</seg>
<seg id="866">From the countries listed below (which in some cases have been connected with each other), several examples may be used for improper use.</seg>

<seg id="901">Malaysia, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="902">Malaysia offers two extreme examples of abusive use of the image from the DR Congo, expressing sympathy towards the Nigerian Massacre, and on the other hand the attempt of a blogger to legitimize the claims that Rohingya have been used.</seg>

<seg id="905">This rectification, which has been published exclusively in English, also includes references to bogus pictures of rumors that Hate Speech operate and are used by extremist groups in order to demonstrate that Muslims kill Buddhists and vice versa (which is often disseminated by Burmese nationalists).</seg>
<seg id="906">Russia, 2012. "(Christianophobia or political provocation?).</seg>
<seg id="907">This post, addressed to members of the Russian Orthodox Church, clearly states that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims who kill Christians.</seg>

<seg id="909">This news page wrongly claimed that the President of Myanmar Thein agreed to be in 2012 that monks and politicians had been involved in the killing of Rohingya Muslims and brought the story together with the image from Sange.</seg>
<seg id="910">The article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still contained in it.</seg>

<seg id="912">This article of 2014 about students who had been killed by the Boko Haram, published by the now-released, the Catholic close to the news page Análisis Digital, has expressly declared that the picture is not from the killings, but it claims that it constitutes a "similar dhadist attack."</seg>
<seg id="913">When the picture was circulated later in connection with the massacres of the Boko Haram in 2015, the newspaper El Pais tried to refute that there would be connections to Nigeria.</seg>

<seg id="915">The DR Congo image appeared with this Twitterhashtag and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the massacres of the Boko Haram in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted their communities to pay greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam.</seg>
<seg id="917">USA, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was taken as evidence of the massacres of the Boko Haram in 2015 (and more than 9,300 times). but the messages related thereto have not been taken up in any religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Hebdo.</seg>

<seg id="921">After a message that was allegedly written by a "Father Juan Carlos Martos" about the Nigerian massacre, there were discussion forums like this one here in Vietnamese and declared it a hoax.</seg>
<seg id="922">From the message in which the picture from the DR Congo was included, the organization of the Claretine Missionaries and Father Juan Carlos Martos dissociated itself.</seg>
<seg id="923">There are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="924">On other accounts, aggregators and sites in the following countries (on the portfolio in Gray), TinyEye also points out, but are no longer fully traceable: Czech Republic, Australia, India, Peru, Netherlands, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan, Japan and possibly China.</seg>
<seg id="925">(data entries with URLs and date / date stamps exist on the Webcrawler and occasionally they have picture file names related to Nigeria or Rohingya Muslims.)</seg>
<seg id="926">In all these cases, which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010, the image may ultimately make a correct description but the original contribution is not available or accessible.</seg>
<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used with regard to larger discussions about the silence in connection with the killings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the killings of the Rohingya by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is underrated as compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Understanding religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question, however, is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are tens of people who unintentionally share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggest this mood of false and false information that actual atrocities are untrue and adorn the real horror of what is actually happening in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The dissemination of violent images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that withholding images of a refusal is equivalent to recognizing the tragedy. sometimes these pictures are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, there is a concern that violent images sensitize readers and spectators and take the ability to feel empathy (for example, this study which investigated how violent media act to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experiment with algorithms to support the fight against "fake News." they will have to think thoroughly about situations in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be used from the context or completely abusive.</seg>
<seg id="940">Each examination of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e.g. insurmountable) endeavors to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not at all to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">There are such words in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese saudade) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish Sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all stubbornly resist any attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or phrase is not enough, which is why a complete explanation and sometimes a context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists cover Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find, for example, words from the Mwotlap language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "" "" "vakasteglok" "" "- take care of your parents in recognition of the way around you in your younger years." ""</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsmith language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - the comfort or laziness that one feels after being warmed in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog Via:</seg>
<seg id="956">They defuse other cultures, reveal other thoughts and awaken our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyse the world around us and classify the linguists on this page want to publish even more of these "irreplaceable" words and show how different, valuable and impressively these small languages are.</seg>

<seg id="970">The island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and landslide disaster in this decade.</seg>
<seg id="971">Triggered by the monsoon, which usually starts at the end of May, the rivers Kalu, Kelani, Gin, Nilwala and Attanagalu Oya came across the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country.</seg>
<seg id="972">After an opinion of the disaster center of Sri Lanka from May 28, 2017, 126 people were killed and just under hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and mud deposits.</seg>
<seg id="973">Over 400,000 people have been affected since last Friday (May 26) and about 100,000 people have been brought to 304 safe locations.</seg>
<seg id="974">The rainfalls ceased on Saturday (May 27) and the water levels in some areas slowly declined.</seg>
<seg id="975">Health and hygiene conditions of the population are a massive challenge in the affected and still inaccessible areas.</seg>
<seg id="976">The following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster:</seg>
<seg id="977">Flooding in Tawalama town with water levels of up to 7,5 m. Twitter users such as Azzam Ameen and Sri Lanka Tweet provide regular updates to flood conditions.</seg>
<seg id="978">Many use the hashtag # FloodSL to monitor the extent of the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="979">Sri Lanka's deadly flooding worsens the Dengue crisis, warns the Children, after further rainfalls are on their way.</seg>
<seg id="980">Today, the Neluwa Bus stood in the flood, water level up to 6 meters. the village of Moragoda near Galle was also flooded because of the water level of the Morogoda Ela, which was flooded yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="981">The Air Force has provided five airplanes for rescue operations and another five are completed for the transport of emergency supplies for the inhabitants trapped in their flooded villages.</seg>
<seg id="982">Various organizations and startups have also agreed to help.</seg>
<seg id="983">Facebook pages such as Help Flood Victims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Disaster Relief - Information Desk- Sri Lanka deliver important information on flood conditions and humanitarian aid.</seg>
<seg id="984">If any search and rescue teams need drones for their operations, please call + 49 774844639.</seg>

<seg id="987">Please call + 7777449729 or 0777843841 if you need help in this area.</seg>
<seg id="988">The taxi-call-app PickMe (Sri Lanka) requests concerned people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Katastophenentrum is informed.</seg>
<seg id="989">Last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Roanu, PickMe launched a "flood relief" button allowing users to call a vehicle for picking up assistance and donations. they were then forwarded to the srilk Red Cross for free.</seg>
<seg id="990">They also launched a "SOS" button, which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue actions for people trapped by floods and landslides.</seg>

<seg id="1001">"" "my girlfriend looks at me and says:" "" "these things do not concern you, or?" "" "why, because I am not Muslims?" "" "I ask." ""</seg>
<seg id="1002">I have already done this conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1003">People with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sahar that they know - from the widespread notion of "Muslims" that has built up in their imagination.</seg>
<seg id="1004">They abdicate me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We do not all look the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice different religions.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves to be a Muslim, in different ways. but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim basket.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims, like me, do not fit in there, are abused.</seg>
<seg id="1010">To be mapped</seg>
<seg id="1011">I'm not alone.</seg>
<seg id="1012">This has even happened to the poet, whose poetry is most sold in America: Rumi.</seg>

<seg id="1014">Love?</seg>
<seg id="1015">Peace?</seg>
<seg id="1016">When Jalaluddin Rumi was as old as I am now, he was an orthodox Muslim preacher and scholar.</seg>
<seg id="1017">The Prophet Muhammad, the Koran and Prophet Muhammad, were the center of his poetry until the day he died.</seg>
<seg id="1018">But in the Western conception the religion of Rumi was wiped out, as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1019">This deleting makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world.</seg>
<seg id="1020">Another exists in the reductionist images of Muslims who have been colonising Western books for centuries.</seg>
<seg id="1021">This tempting visual language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save.</seg>
<seg id="1022">The pioneering Palestinian-American scientist Edward Said disassembled the story behind these images in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="1023">But these pictures still stand out today.</seg>
<seg id="1024">Our politicians, the news industry and Hollywood continued to steer them.</seg>
<seg id="1025">I have worked in the news industry for thirteen years and I have seen how these powerful, erroneous narratives dominate our newsfeeds.</seg>
<seg id="1026">This narrative overshadowed the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries, while the US did not even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1027">This narrative fails to recognize that when French, Muslim women are prevented from wearing their headscarf in public buildings and forcing Saudi, Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body, both of which are two sides of the same coin.</seg>
<seg id="1028">"" "a powerful group exercises its" "" "control" "" "on the" "" "other" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1029">This strong narrative weakens Muslim women carrying movements for change.</seg>
<seg id="1030">It also sees that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Africans who had been brought here with slave ships.</seg>
<seg id="1031">It deletes the existence of queer Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This narrative has cast our collective imagination so deeply and erroneous that often Sikh men and children become the target of anti-Muslim attacks and chicings.</seg>
<seg id="1033">Because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them, Islamophobia is not just fear of Islam, religion, but it is fear of the "others."</seg>
<seg id="1034">To the 1,7 billion belong</seg>
<seg id="1035">In the news industry we do more than just telling stories based on facts.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Or alternative facts.</seg>
<seg id="1037">We also create narrative, helping us to understand the world.</seg>
<seg id="1038">And my industry has failed to record the narrative of 1.7 billion.</seg>
<seg id="1039">And we have failed here, where seven million Muslims in the highest degree constitute "diverse" religious groups in America.</seg>

<seg id="1130">We all need to ask ourselves why?</seg>
<seg id="1131">Why do I tell this here at this TEDx Talk 2017 in Stanford, where Edward Said, the man who showed us how wars are led and people are encouraged by the work of the "others" in public imagination, four decades ago was even a scientist of Stanford.</seg>
<seg id="1132">We need to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of being consciously and unconsciously the "other"; just as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women's March because the occupation that we have no president, the chocolate cake eats while he already encapsulates countries and "other made" people goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1134">Initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity</seg>
<seg id="1135">Story telling, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to connect with someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), telling stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the irreplaceable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of languages in large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has held events since 2015, there is a risk that small and not so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project, the following applies:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided by creating cities that embrace diversity - secure spaces where residents don't have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening to" "" "is often connected with it, these events instead" "" "listen to the listening in order to appreciate, feel, touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers introduce their story first in their own language and translate or explain it in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional story teller, their devotion and their presentation lead to the audience getting involved.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They cry out laughing and emotion as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional Burkina Faso history telling in the Dafing language. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamara tells the fable of the rabbit and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"" "after explaining the importance of his ability, John Nyamara asks:" "" "how to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" "" "with a wide grin he shares his sense of inclusiveness:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far the events of Treasure Language storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to extend it. all those who are inspired by the project can get in touch with TLS to organize their own story stories.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Rico claims to re-establish state debt by the United States</seg>
<seg id="1155">With the aim of a re-check of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which rose to 72 million US dollars, various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration last 3 April 2017; the march started with the American Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went up to Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juan.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (citizen's front for the neural examination of debts) and the ecumenical congregation of Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of reinstating the debt have also submitted a petition to the official home page of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Rico claim that the politicians, bankers and government authorities responsible for debts will be held accountable for their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">"" "" "" "we call for financial review and a management committee without personal interest in public debt, with a firm, our working conditions appropriate compensation, which acts in favor of the economy." ""</seg>

<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartouil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture that is hosted in Berlin, an event of the # FreeBassel campaign was dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the UK-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, managing director of Book Sprints, a publishing house produced by so-called "Book Sprints" published books within three to five days, read extracts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The cost of freedom: collective reresearch).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book published last year and is freely available here contains a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what are the real costs associated with.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense of our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartouil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was removed from the Adra prison directory in which he was sitting on October 3, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then we have no information about his current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective Memory gives his friends and his family a voice that pushes him to his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, right away.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have started to think about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of partly extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred to an unknown place from the Adra prison, a non-military institution.</seg>
<seg id="1202">"" "his wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the" "" "military police of Bassel on the basis of a" "" "strictly secret" "" "command of the military court had taken from his cell in Adra." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she was contacted by people on 12 November 2015 who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His whereabouts and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding the access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the head of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basle's cultural prototypes was more prescient than the work he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilisations and here the Greek-Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influence.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel could not know at that time that ten years after he began this work, the IS would do everything possible to wipe out this architecture which not only embodies the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel couldn't finish this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life with freedom to dream and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English even when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked. he taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a commission which she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was detained.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from the Arabic into English.</seg>

<seg id="1248">Since the protests in 2011 against the Bashar al-Assad regime, more than 65,000 people have disappeared, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights).</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared under the rule of force by the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mozambique: head of prison sentenced to previous post due to corruption</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted to a corruption case in which a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state machine after half of his prison sentence in which corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is the case of Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 together with four other defendants.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the Mozambique airports, the Council of which ruled Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 due to good leadership and immediately called for its reinstatement to the company, which happened on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement from the Republic Attorney's Office of the Republic which evaluated the application, there would be no barrier for Cambaza to resume his old post as the company did not undergo disciplinary proceedings after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many people don't like the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">In an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, CIP), a local institution supporting public transparency, condemned the company's decision to hire the director again:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and exemplifies the lack of transparency and is even a regression with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we note is that the company should have initiated a disciplinary action against the reacting.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company apparently kept silent and did not make appropriate legal action for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the social media of Mozambique, also rejects this behaviour and considers the case as "disgusting":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent guy, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of that.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could give paid talks and motivating speeches, he could consult and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has consented to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza enjoys to be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">It is disgusting!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mosambican and student of political science in Brazil says that the director doesn't have any moral whatsoever:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insulted him I can't believe that one rewards someone in such a way that insulted the state so massively.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing morals and serve the state, * he had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but has instead only served himself in the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was summoned and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, that a thief is in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the Samora Machel prison and will not only be remembered as the first independent president to the Mozambians, but also as a sharp, incisive and - by the way - prophetic utterer.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations was when he vigorously confirmed that "an ambitious man is capable of everything, even the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest to sell."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said, "I don't know if an ambitious person changes, my experience shows that it is not that way. he changes tactics, but he does not turn away from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">"" "an ambitious man is at the same time criminal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter the reactions were also negative:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison for 10 years and was released.</seg>

<seg id="1287">"" "the Burmese word" "" "Kalar pae" "" "means chickpea or splitting blower." ""</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo of Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts off the grid because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although still discussed about the origin of the word, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or are generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censored the word" "" "Kalar" "" "(in Burmese writing) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely degrading connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word used mostly by ultra-nationalists as a hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts in which they have talked about the use of the word have been censored for use of the word.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same character sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, it is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (splits), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooknit Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he had asked his friends in a witty way whether they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun play.</seg>
<seg id="1302">"" "the sentence ku la -" "" "Healing" "" "+ the question word (la) on Burmese - is very similar to racist expression, but the context is completely different." ""</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet is of the opinion that it will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also pointed out that Facebook must be analytical before wiping out all the posts that are suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "Facebook does not delete the word" "" "Kalar" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What should be done instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the spoken words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"" "for example" "" "Kalar Htine" "" "(chair) and" "" "Kalar pae" "" "(splitting bsen)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate speech, receive a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise her nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to all who disseminate hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have shown that the censorship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks can simply start using a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word in order to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">Author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started erasing his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new policy of Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was banned from posting, post and share content for 24 hours, because the mail "didn't meet the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a number of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community to ask for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes to have a benevolent intention to lessen racism in Burma through its platform, but it doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "it also seems as though they have started this without local context or technical support and have prohibited words like" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "pea curry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsified messages.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big revenue, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">"" "" "" "Facebook" "" "automatic censorship has provided much ridicule among users." ""</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users are now making fun of Facebook and consciously writing the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech in order to see if their posts are taken off the grid.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that did not contain any hate speech but were nevertheless removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text reads "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word" "" "Kalar" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1334">"" "the post says" "" "If you are a doctor, then heal people?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should additionally stimulate violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in the Rakhine area, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for its failure to bring out the balancing hate speech on its burmese pages.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have looked better in context than on code-concentrating initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1348">In 2011, the Federal Statistical Office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys were married under 19 from 1997 to 2007.</seg>

<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the draft bill against the children's marriage was decided - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia page was presented on January 18, 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA, obscured internationally.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For more than a month Turkey has been blocking the popular cyclopedia Wikipedia based on the crowdsourcing principle.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day, it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blockage.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech savvy users are used to using conversion tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third-largest VPN prevalence of the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking Article from Wikipedia since 2008, as described recently in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blocking of the Internet has been held since 2007 following the adoption of the Internet Law (No 5651).</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains closed, there are now several mirror sites (pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and are frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">One solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform dissected all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network, which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is available, despite legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports about its efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After listening to the news (through the ban on Wikipedia), we put everything in place to take snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, there is the possibility to read the contents on decentralized and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia contents, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also indicated that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia-Foundation, and it is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a MirrorPage from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirror sites when locked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigniti - Global Voices member and staff at mozilla at Panigrahi's Open Speaks podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">Access a different URL that is not the original. that what you can see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server continues the query to the right Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if it is locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1414">A suckling rhinoceros, Chitwan.</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">With permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurry with poorly positioned motives and washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera himself and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Neptune to the international scene.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown directly next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photographs that draw attention to Neptune's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class position helps in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of the Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just sat at home when I suddenly called myself to Navarre (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he received a call from my father that a leopard would be on the banks of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river Kurfürstendamm is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the leopard was located and I immediately started to kneel pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aims to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Neptune's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know [it], for he had already seen tigers face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be disturbed by the mind of the sheep in sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Bedtime for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness when the king of the Buweik suddenly appeared. he immediately sat down, we look at ourselves and he stares me through the Sal-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar places the logo "I click for conservation."</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepal's nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and usually lived in a tent to take pictures of Otters at the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could take a picture of a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women have the greatest care to pronounce the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "instead, they use a pronouns or say" "" "father of my child" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh women commit to respecting the husband as a result of social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian State of Odisha by a bogus court and expelled from her family and the village community after calling an attached relatives by name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of naming their wives by name is also common among men. however, they have far fewer remittances to fear, if at all which ones, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the Pune district, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel and housewives, joined a unique club and became the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place for them alone, where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Community of Video Volunteers and advocates the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pahas been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to detect practices, such as children's marriage and the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected people, and directs these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in their discussion was by women not calling their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this subject because she wanted to open the talk about the Patriarchate with a problem that women could easily identify with.</seg>
<seg id="1483">To pronounce the names of their husbands not aloud, is a custom that they all uphold and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is regarded as deceitful, as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this until this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try out at home as it is going.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini told us:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him by now on his name." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this confidence in the luggage, Rohini started their first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, upset, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then she asked all," "" "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us what they want, does it mean they don't respect us?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands on their lips," says Rohini Pave of the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the Break of an age-old tradition where married women never allowed to pronounce the names of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini told us:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she chuckled before him during the whole exercise; another decided to release the whole pent-up frustration for him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">In an adrenalin rush about having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that at home they would actually try to name their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the coming days, Rohini received a large number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put the women in her head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it for dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she got scared and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said:" "" "Rohini told me to do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation started out in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reported how women tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinnoberred dot on the forehead that indicates the marital status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women need to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would wear the zinnobered point if he would also do it.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not stopped completely with it, but think that they are now in a better position to choose themselves not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the Discussion Club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make a trip at every discus club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear what," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cake for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, such as our identities on our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things out loud, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to the clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only worn saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most, that's okay, but some wanted to wear a saline Kurta, a wide shirt over a trousers; they did not dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code, the morals associated with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled her own pair of tas (Oberhemden) into a discussion round, so that the women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will manage it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether something has changed in the five months since the first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have only made small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but stopped saying the name of her husband again.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, do it, but only when they are alone and are no other family members.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberrot on their foreheads at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the Discussion Club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like haggling for more freedom of movement or their own dress code - are at the end of a heavily navigating river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini declares:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Every one of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1552">For just five days, the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to make the Japanese crazy.</seg>
<seg id="1553">It became clear to the people here that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many well-known Japanese sizes had reached their zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The music of the cult band is "more than just a universal language," says Ryuichi Isaka, president of the retail giant Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>

<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometers from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was found beheaded and part of the organs had been removed.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently admitted that the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi were used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There is the local superstition that the head of a bald man can reveal gold or bring wealth, the police spokesman of Zambézia of the BBC explained.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of assassinations for obscure purposes, is people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the UN to carry out a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to combat this superstition and prejudice.</seg>

<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milk, where the killings took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Hussene Algy Adamo, student and resident of the city of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique, said that the local police had already followed the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, province of Zambézia, for probably unfaithful rituals, has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In the last days, three men were murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, which was probably made recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo caught attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized due to liver cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (state endangerment) after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto that demanded democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the State Department in China referred to Liu's case as an" "" "internal affair" "" "and told a spokesman that he considered it" "" "not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">However, China continues to take calls from the international community to release the Nobel laureate and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or to allow him treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the harsh treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely wiped out on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised several foreign reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations united nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exert pressure to permit treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway in Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 was awarded to Liu, despite the fact that the Norwegian government announced that it would ultimately have nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were only resumed in December last year. in June, Norway signed an agreement to resume exports to China, because exports have largely been blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to free Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for the release of Lius, as announced in a statement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to raise all limitations of Mr. Lius's wife and family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should meet and receive all the visits they wish, and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="1651">United States of America</seg>
<seg id="1652">"" "us Ambassador Terry Branstad told us that the Americans" "" "wish him the possibility of treatment abroad, so that he can help him in his recovery." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman for the US embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the news agency AFP on 27 June that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu, but also to free his wife Liu Xia from their house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The US Embassy's request attracted a furious answer from China, with the utterance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that "no country has the right to interfere and to make irresponsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley told us that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom, such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice, according to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to urge the Chinese government to unconditionally release Liu and his wife.</seg>

<seg id="1661">Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on July 7 and 8 at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources in Beijing reported to the Reuters news agency that China had great concerns whether the vortex around Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada - Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum called on China to provide Liu with an appropriate medical care and to give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius advocate previously told AFP that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police have always watched the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to talk and contact someone outside, including his lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues to tell:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"" "" "" "Canada urges China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and to release the rights advocated to exercise these rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="1668">France - France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Foreign Office urged China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons in a statement on 29 June:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs, regardless of where. furthermore, his wife and his family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the State Department announced that there is no further information whether France will eventually receive it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan on the wane</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of Foreign Affairs in Taiwan called on China on 27 June to release Liu and show a greater tolerance for those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese lawgiver Yu Mei-nu of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned about Liu in an explanation on June 28 and indicated that many asked him to pray for Lius well being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, stable and prosperous China, which in turn had contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt very moved and encouraged also when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, signed the Charter 08 that stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore was to be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association, the Minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of Singapore's only political party because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported that Singapore should be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "turn the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land, one hears that ultimately we are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very noble: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of that, he invariably appeared undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core point of the topic, the good old leader appears again from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the distorted logic, as it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, during the last week of Shanmugam, the answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judicial system, our political system were really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He tarried related questions with non-replies of rational nature.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls on Shanmugam to show his opinion, since she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally, I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam took the trouble to enlighten this point if he was paid up to be part of the government of the City of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his comment on the blog, he points out the criticisms that one should start reading the entire conscriptions of the conference so that one can better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">"" "read the transcript." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore was rather a" "" "city" "", "he explained why the elections in Singapore are so unequal, even if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities have seen a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said that Singapore was" "" "no country," "" "he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who as the leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it properly and is aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review discovers the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "has Mr. Shanmugam committed" "" "good faith" "" "or was it a Freudian spokesman?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only considered an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, what country will the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore return?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is both country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">As he plays an important role within the cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapore do their military service, but don't they defend their own country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must our prime minister repay bills?</seg>

<seg id="1780">A pop band in Thailand released a music video that parodies the Junta, which in 2014 took power and, in spite of its promise to re-establish the civilian government, continued to rule the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells him what precepts his girlfriend does.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not explicitly political, the music video still refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country.</seg>

<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was also established in the army which monitors the online content and prosecutes people who have been accused of having slandered the monarchy.</seg>

<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the Junta continues to pursue is to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that purchasing is unnecessary and a waste of taxpayers.</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on the website of our partner PRI.org on 19 April 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, located at the border with Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink frame and gold-coloured earrings in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">It is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel doesn't have any charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2.50 per night guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and metal beds.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign to the hotel, but hundreds of African and Haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez tells, people come in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they start crying: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At present it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has welcomed 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some even slept outside on boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to hospital when they are ill, she buys drugs that they cannot afford, they massage them with a balm the feet exhausted by the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mom Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>

<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children there.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, but for some Africans who are on their way to the United States, it is normal to make a first stop in South America and then move north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">"" "the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." "" "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," "" "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">He says that the Haitians and the Africans often travel along the route and that Africans already speak to Whatsapp from Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived previously in Brazil and worked as a construction worker at the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to purchase the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will have contact with Ms Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again," "" "he answers, smiling." "" "we will always be in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells her that her guests often send text messages when they have left to greet them or to tell her about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the driving force of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but it is not the only spark hope for the migrants traveling through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city, a cul de sac leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have immigrated into their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have seen what they are experiencing.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">"" "there are places where people help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1946">After he lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants traveling through Tapachula come from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children in front of people who wanted to blackmail him money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, a single person, offered him her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go the next step.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the corridors, the travellers always consult their telephones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who left.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she leaves her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair care she has made her a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>

<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang by Twitter users in the course of the event</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan District of the city of Urumqi got a mobile notification in which it instructs the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the announcement, the app will prevent" "" "preventing access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the authorities could also use the app for more than combating terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to Radio Free Asia's exclusive report, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because, shortly after they had installed the app, they had exchanged messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">"" "in the notification of the police, the app would identify and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists along with" "" "illegal religious" "" "activities and" "" "harmful information" "" "including videos, images, eBooks and documents." ""</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwanger's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main feature is blocking of pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and to remote control their own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app, with the minors' filters, is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"" "for example, the" "" "remote control" "" "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person." ""</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While reporting on digital censorship in China mostly focuses on users' experiences in larger cities in the East and South, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, crowded, ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and discontent in conflict areas, the authorities often judge extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The Twitter-based media outlet, "Images from mainland China," published by censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where policemen tried to verify the inhabitants randomly whether they had installed the monitoring app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, you could be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They forced the people to use devices intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" also released a Jingwang product description from which the software can lift up the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus unrestricted access to the hard drive of the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang computer and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The Jingwang regulations may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All branches of government, authorities and affiliated institutions, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office in the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report by Freedom House, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published a regulation on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi in order to register their "personal ID cards, cell phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">"" "" "" "the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any" "" "terrorist" "" "videos. however, this action violates the Personality Rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a number of other possible offenses, including those relating to peaceful religious or political communications."

<seg id="2057">I enter the auditorium and meet on Abu Imad, a slender and stocky man; at least he is doing so.</seg>
<seg id="2058">He starts a "pleasant" conversation, despite the facial expressions that glide him: "my boy, you are still young, you can start so much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest to demonstrations that will soon end up."</seg>
<seg id="2059">I did not answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I am accustomed to not responding.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can't really say exactly when insults and blows have become an ordinary means of communication for me.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how this happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">Some voice in me told me that I had to get used to being punished, even though I didn't do anything to make that penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Of punishment in all their diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to pluck as much meat as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls this lovingly "confession."</seg>

<seg id="2068">Your executioner rejoices at your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">Give him the pleasure, you cannot measure yourself with him, and you can't keep your screams back.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My cries were not enough for him, which is why they exchanged the pipe with a cable.</seg>

<seg id="2090">Jordanian rapper Emslam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and opposition</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emslam Hdaib rushes a cigarette into his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emslam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he slides to his canvas, sometimes to his computer, back and then also to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaib's family to flee from their village in Palestine, where they lived as felhayees (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years now, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their well-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rape.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with issues like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues are not only relevant in his hometown Amman, but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by borders in his mind, and he can sympathise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even though he does not openly admit it, he has a special aversion to the US foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib doesn't believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, has anything to do with his identity as a "Palestinian flared second generation," he calls himself even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think so because of my own circumstances," Hdaib emphasizes.</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so, because I am a man," while he poured out Nescafé in two cups in water. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a scorching hot day has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the lugs chat lukewarm coffee and the squadrons of the Kent-cigarette in the nose primarily of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially when you take a look at the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan to drink water - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the interior ministry of Jordaniens has cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front-singer Hamed Sinno, contradicts the country's cultural and traditional standards and is the main reason for the concert evening.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former press spokesperson on the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is a dangerous activism, which inascribes the old-tried legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila underestimated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," who continue to opt for intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement should probably not simply be shallow rhetoric, but actually reflect an increasingly clear crystallizing reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaib's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib mastered traditional gender norms by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who had premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who should actually trust them.</seg>
<seg id="2119">"" "in recent years Jordan has increased the number of" "" "honour murders" "" "- the inofficial outside." ""</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honour murders reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a crime against crime in 1954, women who are exposed to the threat of domestic violence can "be imprisoned in prison indefinitely," and their release often requires years of bureaucratic expenditure and the family's guarantee that nothing will happen to the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaib's music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from issues that have long been considered taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denied that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come out of the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "politics has been tortured," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib attacks the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lavla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb," the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated strikingly often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where you can, in his words, "get what you want" - be it belief or non-faith, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone speaks in Jordan about the rights of gay men and lesbians and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been widely censored by 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, in order to see later that his comments were torn, twisted and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but streamed only a edited version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib openly advertises the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance towards homosexuals does not correspond to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib wonders: if Abu Nuwhat, who was to work on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordan not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemite kingdom there is nothing new anymore that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service found several former members of the government and members of the teacher association, stating that they had critically evoked comments in social media related to the problems associated with the corruption deeply rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaibs's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has now denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - that is what Hdaib sees - consists of slow, thoughtful and internal changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to "experience them."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will converge with the help of music, art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificial cracies. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time has come, Hdaib will continue to rap and consequently resist.</seg>

<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warriors are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is thought that it is a variation of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the fortresses, drums and dancing have been handed over for over a thousand years and come from a time when armies from west Japan marched into the northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We could pick up some great seats, so we had a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can hardly imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition about Wa no Akari (literally.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking forward to the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two solid cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the journey to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # Nebuchafestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The sight of a 18-metre-tall solid car was incredible.</seg>

<seg id="2167">External appearance and body care were rare as in this story, as they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate occupation like that of the barber.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where street robbery and illegal drug trafficking are commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to more and more normal citizens to go into the skilled hands of hairdressers that can recreate these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event, the barber competition "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There, experts compete against each other to show who can create the most eccentric looks, as you can see in the following video (more videos on current contests are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to receive training in hairdressers instead of bad advice, which allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Before the school year beginning in March, the school offered special educational workshops and reported some of its successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995, we were the only college in the community and the district where we are very proud, because we have built up this educational community out of love for the children.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: letter of Love to guerrilla fighters</seg>

<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the article" "" "Love Messages of guerrilla fighters" "", "published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important to bring affection to people who feel kicked out?</seg>
<seg id="2185">It was precisely this question that the young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the BogotArt Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation did not move out of their heads and inspired them to the campaign Carta por la Solliación (letters on reconciliation) which encourages young people to write letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Recently, their country was the setting of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government closed a peace agreement with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary forces of Colombia) forming the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was considered to be so significant that the Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services.</seg>
<seg id="2188">"" "" "" "before the Colombians, however, there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace." ""</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters, who lived in illegal camps for many years, were exposed to war rhetoric and carried their weapons around the clock, must now integrate themselves into the lives of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, which had become accustomed to living in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred of guerrilla fighters, must now absorb it into its ranks and support it in the construction of a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Columbians would have to join together and help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: so far thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter - to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the reconciliation was born at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk with Kailash Satyarthi who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">He explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He continued to share his love with people that needed most of the attention this year.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now need to find their place in society and build a new life. "the letters will show that Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story a common history of peace," she says.</seg>
<seg id="2199">To date, more than 2,000 letters have been collected within the framework of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on March 19 in one of the UN camps in the region of Caldono-Cauca.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the Bogota Foundation travelled to the camp to bring the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC have set themselves up as they had done before, in order to receive the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">"" "it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." "" "it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," "" "said the political scientist Manuela Jiménez Avila later." ""</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governor of the Province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former fighter fought me through the camp of guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go, because beside him on the bed there was a MGL-garnet, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "and I said," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he said," "" "I will answer a letter that someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life someone wrote me something so beautiful, so I answer it. "suddenly the tears flowed over the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely, and sat down beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was too tired of war, was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers from starvation. "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside that waits for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New Voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the start of the event, students and some of the leaders of the FARC met for a discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already in war, and the FARC already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the leaders of the FARC have declared the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave an insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have seen how social injustice was exerting on the whole Colombian people. now that we have the opportunity to develop a political party, we can help shape society more just in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "a goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles," "" "one of them said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Hearing these people who had never been hearing and had no right to vote, and recognizing that the people whom I often had seen as monsters and even hate, were just people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives is hurting me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and executed so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many ex-combatants have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the camp commander in Caldono-Cauca, wrote the following letter for the example of the Archbishop of Cali, the Archbishop of the town of Cali:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians were prophesied that peace would rule after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">This is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people willing to resort to arms, rise and protest for their rights. and that is also fully justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC are now focusing on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all defenders of peace - no matter which race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, for we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will be faced with many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">There will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2265">I did not know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that there was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and finally woke up in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had everything to get along and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two sore wounds in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which case were you laid - in which of the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and laid me among the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for being respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">In February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called upon me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked to send me back to Chechnya to prove that all was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They made absurd demands: some told me that I had to prove it by running up without the streets; others wanted me to appear in the official television in Grosny saying that I had not changed my gender, that all was only bad talk, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to handle this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke my mum on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world that has humiliated not only your family, but the whole republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">It was too much for my mother and she lay a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately, the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later, a car with dark windows and a number plate with 95 on it stood under the window.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time it became clear to me that something was lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activists checked out the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you escape?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to reveal their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something unbelievable happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registering, without knowing anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in at the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't think you're safe, just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know where to go. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "just to prove it to you: it is the number 115." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine it?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still get in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about gender equality, this is a taboo issue.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditionally Caucasian elements are still in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I really try to look at the person they remember from their past - that is, to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But this is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know anything about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have stayed dormant?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who had inhaled in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He said that during Ramadan, no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait and he did not exclude a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"" "I mean, they probably charge the relatives, they take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand proof that the so-called" "" "honor" "" "has experienced genetic satisfaction." ""</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are men still gay men held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine told me that there weren't very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, above all, those who have no wealthy relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to submit to the judgment of Kadyrow.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that they can be presented as terrorists later.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say:" "" "if they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they had attacked some village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, they were deliberately immersed in order to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was detained in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beards had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was himself when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, but there have been no reports about this yet. however, we suspect that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and abductions of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already happened in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I've always been wearing my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already well known in Grozny, when I still lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">Serious in earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was applied, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia wanted to introduce us to" "" "civilisation" "", "but ultimately dropped us back into the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had tinted eyelashes, wore tubes jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of Sharia has never even bent my hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"" "in the Chechen language there is a saying: Khardama Kharda. that is," "" "Scotsman not over the misfortune of another." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to be children, when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never hunted nor beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrov came up with the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began talking on television about morality.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He spoke not about us per se, but above all about the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how people started to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had previously laughed and laughed at once looked at you with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time, I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the republic getting worse.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I earn not much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organise teacrees, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no cents for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I cleared the flood of refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and would like to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chetschenen, who want to prophesy to you with foam in front of the mouth, that there are no gays in them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestan have which, the cabarins have, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet they exist - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it's unpleasant to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Do you know many think about transient to men who love men, and they believe that you are changing your sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of feeling to be precise, different attitudes of life.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I will be so personally here, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am myself now.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the impoverished Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last few months there has been a sharp rise in suicide.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The Arab workers' photo in Iran was made available by the Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on 27 August drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran that is shaped by poverty and unemployment, into the limelight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability of his family to arise, so Ahrazi's human rights groups who work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared by YouTube held the moments after he had lighted himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the incinerations were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ahrazi, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others hanged Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family faders who felt helpless and incapable of feeding their families and pursuing a safe job because of the persecution of the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahrazi is suffering from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region in which most of the Arab Ahwazi communities living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to make a living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab ancestor was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and in 1925 undertook great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and most valuable usable areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population only has little to do with this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often the victim of untreated illnesses, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime systematically denies the Ahrazi Arabs to work in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a large number of dams, which divert water from the Arabic regions to the Persian areas, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are surrounding.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to devastation caused by dryness caused by dryness, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab ahawks increased to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director for cooperatives, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of the Ahrazis who are looking for a job, completed primary school, 55% completed a secondary school and 45% have a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"" "a" "" "systematic strategy" "" "aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahrazi human rights activist based in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" in the number of suicide among young Ahrazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians emerging in Ahwaz and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since officials and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers, local Arab Ahrazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livelihood outside their homeland of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first name and surname in order to hide their affiliation with the Ahrazi and to be hired because even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone the speech of the Arabic language or the wearing of Arabian clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the given circumstances that the Arab Ahrazi must endure, human rights activists attack alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>
<seg id="2430">Depression is treatable and suicide is avoidable.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I don't identify with feminism, even with the intersectionalism"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Photos taken by Pixabay. published by CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the Afroféminas website.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say I'm not a feminist, many women - especially white women, who call themselves as intersectional feminists - are frustrated.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well-thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all feminine girls.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women today earn less money than men despite equal education.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and societal standards still make sure that women come across a glass ceiling sooner or later in different areas of life, and that discrimination based on gender is still cross the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is known and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced that I suffer twice and threefold among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: when I come to terms of colour, on racism, on black women's women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; when I mention whichever way we have been abused physically, emotionally and verbally, both in and out of the feminist movement, many white feminists choose to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But all agree that women - all women - should come together to "lift their voices up and sing" Kumbaya, my Lord "to achieve equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to say that in addition to sexualised violence, there is an institutionalized form of racist-motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in twofold ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnic groups and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"" "" "" "or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of all skin color to have the same rights; on the other hand, as a black woman, I cannot join a movement, in whose centre the white woman stands, who refuses to take into account injustices in her thinking, which relate to both sex and skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere, which has always and again rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "in 1851," "" "Am I not a woman?" "" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a menial and marginalized being in a historical sense." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropriation to advance their egocentric programme.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlapping skin color and gender. some of them will continue to keep silent on the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to teach them a better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different origins a home and distinguish themselves from the white feminism, the word "feminism" is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to release myself fully and completely from feminism and to join the movement of Womanism, which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of using myself for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: Reclaiming "(about: Africa-Womanism: how we reclaim ourselves) speaks of how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves on our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces where they are perfectly safe and where the spiritual, mental, physical and even spiritual elements can be worshipped, which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to learn about hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement affected by the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift up black women and women of other cultures, because I exist in this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment where my life neither bypassed, nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed for the protection of affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner said Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner, who had become violent against her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship, some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another wife Balbuena showed up for mistreatment, Ada Báez 'informed ad did not use anything.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second wife returned her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">In general, when women submit a report, they generally do not receive any support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence have to report to the law enforcement authorities.</seg>

<seg id="2490">It is hard to find out how many women are really abused, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social science research institution in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2491">The available numbers, however, are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, 9600 cases of domestic violence were reported by the District Attorney General. 70% of these were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5,000 signs of domestic violence in peace courts. 86% of women's ads came here as well.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the advertisements, 40% of women said they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of mental abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics, however, do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan Women's Minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown. "for every woman who is refunded in Paraguay because of mental mistreatment 9 women who do not do this.</seg>

<seg id="2499">Since the crime of women in Paraguay is not a criminal offence, the law enforcement authorities cannot appropriately document how many women are murdered each year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016, journalists included at least 12 cases of women's murder in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The human rights coordinator in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>

<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning she didn't want to do that, but gave up. this should be regrettable.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos. but for two years she endured the psychological violence in his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognisable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that only women who are too subservient because they are deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse carried out by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote posts on Facebook where she described her insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he ever had lifted his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had failed for so long by Carlos and didn't leave him before.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had a certain complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who does not come from Paraguay, fought with the authorities in Paraguay for almost eight years to prove that their former partner mistreated them.</seg>
<seg id="2517">"" "Victoria is a member of the Network Yo te Creo (" "" "I believe you" "" ") consisting of women who are all victims of abuse in any way." ""</seg>

<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">A draft law was discussed in the Paraguayan Parliament on 10 August 2016, which was announced under the hashtag # PorEllas (# feared).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and movement # NiunaMenos (# nonnatives) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law foresees that FemÃ izid should be declared an independent criminal offence and to punish harder as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus, the wording of the bill was changed in some points in order to also gain members for the law, which feared that the way for decriminalisation of abortions was denied, which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and punishable with up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill had intended to pay the bulk of the (bureaucratic and economic) process costs, which the victims of violence currently have to bear, if they just want to report and receive a secure accommodation, to impose the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as a part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">A rethinking must take place here, so that violence is no longer considered a normal thing.</seg>
<seg id="2537">"" "" "" "he who is silent in the face of these facts is complicit and contributes to the fact that the perpetrators are powerless." ""</seg>
<seg id="2538">"" "" "" "we need to report so long until maltreatment is no longer considered normal." ""</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the paraguayan senate. before, parts of the law had been changed, but a passage was cancelled, among other things, which the partners in cases of domestic violence called for reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="2540">Opinions on the changes go apart.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, illustration takes place with his agreement</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all. it is a growing area addressing one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site: on the one hand, many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent are missing.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious consequences in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for researching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research carried out by African scientists is helping to establish own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of Central Laboratory at the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, when the AIDS epidemic showed first serious implications for national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for studying in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home in order to support the Serbian health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier talked about the future of medical research in Zambia and about the misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. in doing so, I support the samba national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">I am also starting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GM: what do you think are the most important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always be recipients rather than being a maker.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not well usable in our surroundings, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GM: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are promoted differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who come back or move here because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">Which obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not previously have?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: how large is your view of the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it concentrate on and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special academic training starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, exploration of space, health care (non-communicable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GM: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often it is the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system means that magazines are only available for payment (the so-called "Paywall"), which also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>

<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding in the USA salad since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">His company offers 114 sorts such as Outlying Gorgeous, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited by its own ingenuity and the question of how many types of salads he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents apply not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or spilled leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereal or card types. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia old tradition, Morton is still breeding a salad, but he needs longer since his work is increasingly difficult due to increasingly restraints.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is as if a boulder would lie in a river to shrink." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do it now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think these patents go too far on salads." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand in court, no one can breed a new sort of lettuce because all the features are already patented. "he continues to do as good as possible and tries to breed those features he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very cautious and strives to not use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined forces in the United States and around the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>

<seg id="2643">It is not by chance that this name sounds rather as if the movement originates from the IT field and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for open source seed) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">In the context of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders may undertake to use the seeds bred by them freely.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it. "open Source" breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties, and do not immediately sow - two aspects which are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeritus professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg control of the seed and the possibility to grow new plants is important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would attempt to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">"" "Kloppenburg points out that the" "" "open source" "" "movement does not deal with genetically modified plants." ""</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed," he says. "those who want to buy good, locally and sustainably produced vegetables, such as farmers markets, should also know that the way in which this vegetables is grown is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative pledge to keep seed available to others, as opposed to patenting seed and plant traits.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk because the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the growing number of intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always available.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has worked in her doctoral thesis on genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all card features are protected as intellectual property, which makes it difficult for plant breeders to be used either at all or only.</seg>
<seg id="2659">Such estimates are not yet available for other plants, but experts such as Luby suggest that large-scale cultivated plants such as wheat in even greater style are patented as lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are grown in such a way that they show desirable characteristics - from those through which their taste or colour improves up to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and sustain threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changing conditions due to climate change are much worse predicable.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto recognizes that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to the preservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "it contradicts the view that intellectual property may restrict other breeders because" "" "patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation." "" "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expires." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "such protection does not inhibit innovation, it promotes it by providing more material and know-how to the public." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks different: 20 years to wait, until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to grow plants that are adapted to changing environmental conditions, you would have lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">But the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">"" "" "" "we want farmers to make their work easier." ""</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it is impossible for us to continue to use the best and latest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">All in all, Morton is bothered by the concept of patented plant characteristics: "we do not really create the features ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form it themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">"" "a secret of nature." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "who breeds a variety, also breeds his own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, whose cultivation involves large quantities of herbicides, is breeding in its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exactly the opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such that operate on international markets but smaller than for example Monsanto) have patents, they create most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for salads at his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also convinced that breeders should be more innovative by avoiding plant patents: "it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patent.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I always need new material for my catalog, since I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years themselves, "he says." with a patent they have been protected for 20 years from competition, which makes it very easy for my opinion. "worldwide resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the US seems to be a leader in open source breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, is a "open source" seed program. to preserve the seeds of traditional crops, the Centre works with farmers and helps them breed new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">"" "it also supports them to come to" "" "open source" "" "seeds and sell their own." ""</seg>

<seg id="2687">(rules for breeding differ from country to country, so the Ossi obligation cannot be easily adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable, thus contradicting the current practice of the European Patent Office which allows patents on conventionally bred plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to implement the Patent Office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on open source seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all East Africa came together to learn about the "open source" seed movement and the worldwide trend towards seed patenting.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for "open source" seed systems, explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for open source seed systems for which next year the official launch of the seed should fall.</seg>
<seg id="2692">An association of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of food, has published a report on aid organizations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others. it believes farmers have the opportunity to come to seed, exchange and improve seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured.</seg>
<seg id="2694">The report also emphasises the importance of a diverse local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a context that Luby von Ossi hopes that more people will soon see him.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological food has largely taken care of where and how something is cultivated, and seed systems have hardly played a role here," says Luby. "we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the newest goals of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities are still blocking content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 5 August, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports about it.</seg>
<seg id="2724">"" "" "" "in August, the network published an opinion on Facebook, in which the Egyptian authorities criticised for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region." ""</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains faithful to its goal to uncover the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, to uncover the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, so it has never been as important as it is now. ANHRI affirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome and not impart. we insist on fulfilling our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page of the Huffington Post and the Arab-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Qatar-based network of Al Jazeera due to alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation belonging to the wave of website barriers. @ anhri one of the main data sources for human rights in the Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmopDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, the blog of columnists and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no more access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the distribution of columns and articles that he writes for websites and media that are not accessible in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he directed to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government, became the target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider with which also Ziada's blog is given a home, on the other hand is more accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, reporting on the student protests and recording a video, as the police practiced physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">To lock the blogs is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even though blocking the blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) They succeeded in giving me the feeling of a state of siege, an arrest, a attempted murder, a summons to the National Security Council, the blocking blogs, and any other web site for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) They have shown that I did not write for nothing in vain. in other words, my words have influence if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to post articles in order to circumvent censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after blocking him and that they're afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave ones walk the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities blocked websites from 24 May to 06 August. this resulted in technical tests on the networks of different Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and ETISALAT.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Afte also documented the closure of providers, which was possible through the transfer of internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12th we noticed how the blocking of web pages that VPNs offer began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the government's intention to continue to block and filter content to which Egyptian users could have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the situation is also worsened by the fact that decision-making decisions are made behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which they can proceed against these acts in court." ""</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in the war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>
<seg id="2751">The Brazilian army in the Favelas in Niterói, a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro, during the government crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2752">Photo by: Estado Maior (CML) via photos públicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0</seg>
<seg id="2753">Newspapers in Brazil are reporting every day with gloomy news from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14 years old in school," "Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is assassinated," "Thieves smoke a pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and air sea to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the 2017 wave of violence reached the highest level for 10 years in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice also called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">For the detailed reporting on violence in Rio, the newspaper "Extra" published the editorial "This is not normal" in which she announced to set up a new column called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The newspaper explained the motives for their decision like this:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every big city in the world like murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. everything, however, deviates from the civilised standard and what happens only in Rio is published in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, stated that this decision was not a reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper in the world with a war break in a country that doesn't recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist tells the newspaper that there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">"" "" "" "we are aware that a war discourse, if distorted, can also be used to hide atrocities of the police who are only shooting and then asking questions." ""</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article published in the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira argues that the violence as a "war" argues. this is in their opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold accountability in the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated by the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Remember: the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than just its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2776">Photo by: Fernando Frazão / Agência Brasil. published with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2777">Calling Rio de Janeiro as "the most violent place in Brazil" is false according to Cecília: "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are in the north and northeast of the country according to statistics of 2015. these are the most up-to-date available data.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities are in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "when we look at the Mordrates pro state, Rio is on" "" "16" "", "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">In addition, Globo, the largest media corporation in South America, has been a member of the state's largest media enterprise, which, like Cecília, has been repeating the state's security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">The creation of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit imposed by the state of Rio in 2003, is one of these security policy measures.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths. for some years, the UPP was increasingly under fire after several reports of harassment and repression against the poor communities, which the newly created police unit was supposed to protect.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page journalist João Paulo Charleaux cited one of his articles from 2010, explaining why the violence in Rio does not meet the criteria defined by the Geneva Convention for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the grading of the situation in Rio as a war also causes serious consequences for people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This calls for the state to use means and ways typical of war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," in which a civilian is an insignificant point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "lost balls."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War back or forth, the fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas continue to suffer in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">One week it is time for the police to get up the mountain with the favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: a vendor died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and Surrounding, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The region of East Ghouta, where chemical weapons attack on 21 August 2013 called for hundreds of civilians, is particularly affected.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition go out, based on studies by the United Nations and other human rights organizations that the massacre of the Assad regime has been committed.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege, leading to the fact that local residents are dependent on locally produced or smuggled foodstuffs.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Thanks to the years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own fungi as a "life saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and perform the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods grown in Syria and are rarely part of Syrian cuisine. however, their food is an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Directly of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we chose to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and waiters."</seg>
<seg id="2813">"" "Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports global Voices, who has been fighting for three years to announce this project and expressed its relief that it is becoming more and more" "" "gaining popularity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2814">In order to collect money for the initiative, we use the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDO in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to give 125 families knowledge of planting mushrooms, says Leila to Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the constitution of this article, they have reached more than 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 €, but will continue to raise funds to Cando by Monday, the 4th of September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative relies on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the fuel shortage, locally produced fuels are made of plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">"" "Dr. Leila said, Global Voices, that they started the" "" "production of mushrooms from the regions" "" "before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption." ""</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested in many district capital cities in Portugal on 21 October, demanding justice for victims of fires that were rampant in the northern part of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires on October 15 and 16. this led to the government to call out a state shower last week for solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 bursts spread out in the northern and central regions of the country and reached some 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy occured in Pedrógão Grande where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest monitoring system, which monitors the forest areas by satellite photographs, approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can get a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire only in 4 districts.</seg>

<seg id="2855">To these problems, the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15th and 16th, when people sought information or attempted to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided information to the population: it took advantage of its own civil protection data with the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was critical at this fateful weekend in October that the servers were not able to withstand the rush of 400,000 users who followed the fires: the site counted more than half a million accesses.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hzb-e-Wahdat party dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara suddenly felt vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, well-known for their hatred, came closer and closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his flight, Ashark found himself in Pakistan again.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. his work was hard and made him ill.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his low wages, and went to Iran. once again he found himself in a foreign country with other refugees and dragged bags with mortar which were harder than himself to make a living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf remembered in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the site we were working on.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows, so that we could not freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without documents in Iran and was ready to travel to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">In the dangerous crossing of the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his application for asylum, Ashark arrived in Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time, Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, fell asleep in parks and went to a church distributing food to the needy twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high population quotas. however, it is true that the conditions that asylum seekers are finding in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "the human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system" "" "suffers from a general lack of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000" "" "special recording centres" "". "these are improvised bodies in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can be drawn up for months after the registration of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">And so did Asharaf too.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his uncertain lifestyles helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions very soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After several years of working in the construction industry, Ashark put his entire savings into the creation of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to inofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the road to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Over the past few years, some Afghans have arisen, including tailor shops, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience where the waiters and the kitchen staff were mainly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the Pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Ashara's targets extend far beyond the Italian gastronomy trade and the retail sector and aim to return to the country that he had forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are opportunities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily, if I know that my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I am planning a project for farmers from the poorest provinces in the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">"" "Asharper also forges plans to open a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques." "" "this way, they can sell their crop surpluses on the market and improve their financial situation," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end stability and prosperity are at the end.</seg>
<seg id="2927">He has made this journey himself. now he wants to help other Afghans on this path.</seg>

<seg id="2929">He reported the clearance of the camp 'Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo, protesting against the suspension of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Photo by @ Ciluna27 on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen-Report is an international snapshot that shows challenges, wins and upcoming trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament has reviewed a draft bill that foresees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users need to register to use the social networks within six months of the successful legal decision on the authority's website stating their full name and ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who miss this step could be sentenced to up to six months of prison sentence or a penal punishment.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was applied by sixty members of parliament, is currently facing the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">In May, another member of the Bundestag filed a legislative proposal to introduce more severe penalties for the insult of the president or to a senior official.</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the law proposition, however, such a deed would be punished with prison and fines, according to legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is passed, this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the defendants.</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in jeopardy for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian policemen, demonstrating force against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the inauguration of elected President Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan was waiting for four years in prison for more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested at the same incident.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to 20 May because the prison management failed to bring the accused from prison to the courtroom according to human rights groups.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan faces the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, apparent pollution of inter alia, weapons possession, illegal gathering, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a Criminal Court in Giza released the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their reporting on the pro-Morsi sitting block at the Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The Court also reduced the sanctions of the journalists Abdullah al-fakresany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the previous incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activist interrogated on leaked documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gresbia, who is co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gresbia's plan was chiefly interrogated by the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan, explicitly supports a controversial draft law that would guarantee business people and former regimes by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption, provided that these funds returned illegally.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on April 21 on the website of Nawaat throws a light on how the presidential plans to support the bill of law look like.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gresbia declines the nomination of his sources under Article 11 of the Tunisian Press Code, which secures journalists the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he appeared in the Regional Court in Tunis on May 09 as a witness.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force the users of social media to present their identification?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to the new rules of the information offices of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China need permission before they write or share news in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">The rules also indicate that registration will be necessary with full real name.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts suspect that this will allow the elimination of anonymous comments within social networks. it is not clear until now how the authorities will apply these regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to enforce these regulations only selectively, in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Then do we see ourselves in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May, the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging app.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "according to Rosado, WeChat failed to register with the state government as the" "" "Organiser of Information Diffusion" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">This term is part of a law from 2014, thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that organise the "publication of information." the law also makes it possible for the government to make up-to-date services for removing content and to force them to suspend user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These websites currently include websites such as Vcontacts and Odnoclassniks (Russia's two most popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, the email service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court decrees ban Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ordered the Wikipedias in Turkey, after Wikipedia's administrators refused to erase two English-language articles, the information that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">"" "the Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communication informed that the site was closed because it was" "" "an information source that cooperates with groups to create a political defamation campaign against Turkey." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time Turkey has completely blocked its website. it is, among other things, China, one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Great Britain can't stop to snuggle up</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week, the British government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communication in real time and install Backdoor programs that decrypt data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunications companies and secret services regarding the proposal, but has left other technology companies and the civilian population on the outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation continues until May 19. reactions and suggestions by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
