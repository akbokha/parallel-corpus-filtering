that is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times repor@@ ter .
long before anyone heard Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally listened to tel@@ eph@@ ones of Americans .
but it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic U.S. intelligence operation in which the CIA literally delivered dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb .
if this sounds crazy , read it .
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years , the government has established itself against Ris@@ en and called upon him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern of condem@@ ning whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and sp@@ ying journalists .
according to the first constitutional amend@@ ment , the media have the right to publish confidential information .
but it is impossible to use this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous ones who reveal it .
so when the government kno@@ cked on Ris@@ en , he did something that many brave repor@@ ters had already done before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , even though they had given indications for years that it would be essential in their case , the demands of the government of Ris@@ en were dropped .
the reason : in the time of electronic surveillance , the repor@@ ters and sources can hide themselves less and less .
instead of ex@@ cre@@ ting and ris@@ king forward ris@@ ings , they could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , were secretly worried about his telephone calls ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , his credit history , and even travel tips with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey ster@@ ling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s alleged source .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to defend whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower . instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary condemned more than all US governments before him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government down@@ gra@@ ded too much of its work as a secret .
since September 11 almost every article about national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional amend@@ ment , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as the government &apos;s technology allows the government to circum@@ vent the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can use technologies to better protect their sources .
and they can do so from the moment they get in touch , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand .
today there is communication software that didn &apos;t exist when Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
one such technology is Secure@@ drop , an open source transfer system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and today has been developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation .
instead of sending an email , go to a news site like the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send information , just like with any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the relevant news agency has access .
so the government can no longer proc@@ ure information secretly , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the start .
Secure@@ drop , however , is only a small part of the whole to protect freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new es@@ pion@@ age technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze us all .
it &apos;s up to us to make sure that not only technologi@@ sts like Edward Snow@@ den have a chance to bring mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower ,
who knows about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the supply of soldiers and wants to report about crowded hospitals . or the nearest environ@@ ment@@ er who sends alarm to the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a wall @-@ street insi@@ der who warns us of the next financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least , these technologies have not only been made for those who want to expose themselves to crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 the biggest data leak of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; reveal that emp@@ ires and powerful &#93; &#91; enormous sums of money have hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to give an explanation . &#93;
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already lead to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ ig@@ ned .
there are also reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has mail@@ box companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is claimed that a trace of $ 2 billion will lead Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin to a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ lists .
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release , and the next reveal documents .
now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that affects all of us .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
throughout the world media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by a few to hide and veil their fortun@@ es -- something that we have been discussing for ten years .
I think many people seem to be very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a mat@@ ry@@ jo@@ g doll .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures .
it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society to really understand what is happening .
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
probably because there were no prominent Americans in these revelations , this sc@@ andal .
now it &apos;s not that there are no wealthy Americans hiding their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but due to the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , it is such that in some US states it takes less information to provide less information to establish a company than to obtain a library card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of in@@ transparency in the US allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has allowed frau@@ d@@ sters to rip off especially vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
it really shocked us that all except one lawyer made proposals for our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money .
none of these attor@@ neys accepted us as clients , and of course nobody was given money to anyone . however , it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as an individual case .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian involved in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to complic@@ ate this type of behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that may sound very evil as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and the powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist I see that things have begun to change .
over the past few years , we have seen pushing for more transparency regarding the owners of companies .
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU registers in central registers on a national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US lag@@ ged behind .
representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in the two parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make progress that we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in business to get up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and advoc@@ ate to end this kind of transparency by law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally stop the transparency which now enables this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story of how I was almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
one day after I finished my design studies , I went back home .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just had a road@@ trip across the country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me enthusi@@ astically how he wanted to change the world .
it got late . I got tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
what am I supposed to do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a place to sleep ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans this . I don &apos;t want to be kidn@@ apped in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small boot !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard me say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; See how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what did I rock myself ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
a wild stranger sleeps in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what if he &apos;s crazy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I got out of bed , embarrass@@ ed at the tips of the door , and closed my bedroom door .
but he wasn &apos;t crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art he bought from me hangs today in his class@@ rooms . he is now a teacher .
that was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my point of view .
maybe the people who were sold to me in childhood were friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
to house people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s take a time leap , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate pul@@ ls out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could make something about it . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including a mattress and each morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and thus created so @-@ called &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor .
they found it super , and we too .
I am sure , our cheese @-@ ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ettes tasted completely different because we did it for our guests .
we were touring with them throughout the city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed at us .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came rolling .
my former fellow , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if we could make a business concept out of it .
this is what we presented to investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people post public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting .
over the Internet , they can then invite stranger people to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we were waiting for the mis@@ sile to fire .
but they are not .
nobody who is still in con@@ sol@@ ation would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children we have learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you look at things that you can do well . we were able to design .
at the Academy of Arts we had learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create an immense trust through design , between people who had never met before .
can design do something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of the degree of confidence we have entr@@ en@@ ched .
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone in your hand .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked cell phone to your left @-@ hand neighbour .
this silent approach to panic that you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in the hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
this is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason can our company exist .
just so , who actually has Al Gor@@ es mobile phone ?
could you please announce on Twitter that he is running for the President of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail about this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first introduced himself to his name ; if he had told you where he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you would have 150 jud@@ gements that all say : &quot; he can really capture really well @-@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you would have to give up your mobile phone ?
because a well thought out feedback system strengthens trust decisi@@ vely .
in the beginning we have done some things wrong .
it was hard for the people to disp@@ ense with negative jud@@ gements .
in the end , we decided to wait until both host and guest left their assessments before we set them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how much they are in terms of age and place of residence .
not surprisingly , we trust people most , who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting if you add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by assessments .
if you have less than three assessments , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation stands out in common .
the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one can tell too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great art works in your apartment ! I &apos;m going on vacation with my family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you manage to create this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which subjects you should write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we had not reck@@ oned with was the great amount of people who were more than willing to disp@@ ose of these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
first of all : incredibly good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
thir@@ dly , a demand that had previously not been covered .
the business is running very well for us .
of course there are times when everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who were not allowed to party parties or have devast@@ ated homes .
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I was at the forefront when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think about it .
the disappointment that one hears in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
fortunately , of the 123 million nights , only a fraction of a problem had ever been encountered .
for men have confidence in one another .
if trust works , it can result in miracles .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Ja@@ vier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know one at all .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring your books .
they can even stay longer without charging the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course not every stay exp@@ ires .
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the thought of sharing work together with monetary transactions ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about economic trading . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now it is easy to call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing is not fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade which promises human relationships .
people place a part of themselves openly , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , you can compare it with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if in any place you visited a group there would be waiting for it to fill it thoroughly and to show you in a pub @-@ tour quarter of which you have never heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
today , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments from the ground up to the other ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of sharing ?
I imagine cities that enable us to society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces that belonged to the government ,
were offered now residents . students looking for a place to stay ,
were im@@ par@@ ted to people whose children were moved out . incub@@ ators programs were started ,
in order to be able to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even a host .
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we didn &apos;t re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
hospitality was there before .
there were similar sites in front of us .
so why did our work work ?
apart from luck and timing , we realized that with the components of trust you can find the right design .
design can help us overcome deep rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find this amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I must think about it every time a red Maz@@ da passes by me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this big impact , I wonder what we can use in the near future .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washing , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay at the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media are people who look like me .
one study found that 80 % of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a w@@ ann@@ abe @-@ fitness fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing spiritual Muslim .
but not as Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born so .
I decided to do this .
when I was 17 , I decided to ou@@ st myself .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the hi@@ j@@ ab , my head covering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : back then , it was a declaration of independence for me , against the pressure I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;@@ an .
I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted , and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow dedication , deep@@ ening with each reading of the Qur &apos;@@ an .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes makes me cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
have you ever had the feeling that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , understands you completely , and yet somehow loves you ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I got married and started , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast in the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking News . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew into buildings , people jump@@ ed out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical mal@@ function ?
my shock quickly turned into ou@@ trage .
why should I do something like that ?
I changed the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... , ... &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
not only did my country be attacked , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others turned me into a susp@@ ects .
on the same day , we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move into a new city and start studying .
I remember how I ro@@ de -- as we ro@@ amed -- as deep as it went into my seat , and I was afraid the first time I was recognized as Muslims .
we moved this night into our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations which said : &quot; be watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Sta@@ y in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t be mu@@ til@@ ated . &quot;
I stayed in@@ doors all week .
then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings were waiting : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a destination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people held for Muslims to free and beat .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something didn &apos;t feel right .
because the people who attacked this country have attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got the anger of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was angry too .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
these are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today we can actually say people say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as from a tumor in the body of the United States .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know that a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less , because the question is false .
like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumour in the body of the United States , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympic athletes .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America more secure ?
there may be a few parking spaces , but not stopping the terror .
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to a more toler@@ ant view of people of other fai@@ ths and to show greater citizen participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington , DC area recently told me that people are actually not being radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
during the ra@@ dic@@ alization process it has been established that it starts online . first , the person is cut off from their congregation , even from their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts may make a bra@@ in@@ washing that leads to the person believing that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or dis@@ liked by faith .
if we want to prevent radi@@ cal@@ isation , we must stop people from going to the mos@@ que .
some still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would fit into their imag@@ inations if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , like the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology grounds on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; holy book &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when you look at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scriptures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that makes them read these things into scrip@@ ture .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she pre@@ tended to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was just the opposite . every minister with whom she spoke brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing , and something that would have made sense to their anger , it was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised it a solution .
this Ima@@ m re @-@ established the connection with God and His church .
instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive way for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , to our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we accept rather an author@@ itarian regime , conformity and prejudi@@ ce .
a study shows that if you submit news in which negative about Muslims were reported , they were more likely to attack military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the pr@@ un@@ ing of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not only an academic problem .
if you look when the mood against Muslims pushed upward -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in the context of terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two electoral periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terrorism as I expected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all .
when it comes to the allocation of collective debt , it is not only about having to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was talented at the dental Faculty , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous man she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was ast@@ o@@ unded and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when did my brother have such an accomplished young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , has murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who visited the afternoon .
he shot at De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or stayed safely at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion .
we chose the mos@@ que .
with our son in the child &apos;s seat we ro@@ de sil@@ ently , with high pressure at the mos@@ que .
I took him out , put off my shoes , and went into the prayer hall , and what I saw let me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , for half of the gathering were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had encouraged courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or will you join those who think that we are better than ours .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what do you say to those who might say that you hold a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with a drau@@ ght , work in a noble thought factory , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t dec@@ eive yourself . I &apos;m perfectly normal .
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as allowed .
if you look at Muslims around the world , and I did this with the largest study conducted in Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I &apos;m in no way an exception .
when people like an exception to rule appear , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a billion dollar business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air package delivery penet@@ rated our social awareness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six @-@ meter high tower of 1 500 tiles live in front of the audience . some years ago , they began to fly with ropes .
by connecting to each other , flying devices achieve high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test of spaces .
you can also build self @-@ winding structures .
they have learned to bear burdens , to deal with turbul@@ ence and to react in general to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to transc@@ end the limits of possibility in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to operate autonom@@ ously , it has to know collectively where the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects , which enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new location technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space , determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are on the highest level . for example , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called hed@@ geho@@ g ,
a flying machine trying to beat two flies with a flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in the forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations .
in contrast to most star@@ ters it can float , and thus has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of h@@ edge star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that it doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions which penetrate the core of the matter .
for example , what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remote @-@ controlled aircraft that only had two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
we discovered that flying is working with only one .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ ner , the mechanically easiest Remote controlled Flight Device . it was invented recently .
it has only one moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ bs , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is simple , in the inner life very much happens so that it can fly stable and move in space everywhere .
however , it does not have the elegant tail@@ gate algorithm . to make it fly , I have to throw it right .
the odds of throwing it right when all of you are watching is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
when the mon@@ osp@@ ary is an exercise in amusement , this machine here , the Omni@@ kop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , is an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
therefore , it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
through this he receives the au@@ d@@ acious ability ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter which direction it is rot@@ ated or even as it rot@@ ates .
of course it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some things can be imagined in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let &apos;s look at that .
when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they have to be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller flying machines .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
when you build them , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller fails , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly , albeit limited .
we will now demonstrate this by making one @-@ half f@@ light@@ less .
the last demonstration examines synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took standard Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where it is in the room and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe press over there wants to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology .
for guys like us the reward lies in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed around each other in a very remote gal@@ axy ; they turned the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second .
this short moment they lit more brigh@@ tly than all the stars along in all the gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
their energy , however , did not set them free in the form of light --
finally , we speak of black holes .
the whole energy was released into space @-@ time @-@ structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us first arrange the events in time .
more than 1.3 billion years ago , there was just multi @-@ cell life on Earth .
since then , the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God stands with us -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago a group of particularly courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from the MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector , to look for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are formed by col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea .
after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser @-@ interfer@@ omet@@ er- gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves observ@@ atory .
in the following period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which greatly improved the detection capacity .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , just a few days after the detector went into operation , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes dri@@ lled through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of My Dau@@ ghter
and the farewell from my death @-@ sick father .
basically , it was the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been investigating gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes and their signals meas@@ urable by observ@@ atories for 23 years . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a ri@@ ft in the structure of space and time .
when moving the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and st@@ owed in the other .
for the sake of illustration , instructors in courses for rel@@ ativity play a real caus@@ al dance .
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14th , for example , each of us was stretched and gest@@ ed at the arrival of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that means 20 zer@@ os after comm@@ a followed by a 1 . that &apos;s why one declared the Lig@@ o employees crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometer laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured in less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nucle@@ us . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical lyrics about gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; &quot; &quot; described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength that is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile .
this is quite practical , because so you can create a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you .
with sounds this is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that are particularly important to you :
about your child &apos;s face .
instead we listen to certain properties like pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now Alice is talking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob stops them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the all speaking .
to listen to the gravity can tell us much about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been working very long already .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , chir@@ ping simply : w@@ up@@ p !
the two bodies turn very fast , you hear the same cir@@ cus with an additional key change . that sounds like the wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed in the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render noise &#93; somebody who knows what to listen to , knows this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ times solar mass , which spin around as quickly as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s consider what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns are cir@@ cling a hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know that because we have heard it .
this is the permanent meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a whole new way to explore the universe as it was never before .
on this path we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in space we can &apos;t see -- virtually or princip@@ ally -- not .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about the universe .
the exciting physical processes occur at the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through because these are opa@@ que .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it , because the Big B@@ ang is hidden by its own night light .
with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and most importantly , I am optim@@ istic that there are things we have never seen before , which we have never seen and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt that we didn &apos;t expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the League project , says on this subject : me : the kind of stars that reveal black holes how Lig@@ o watches them are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies of prehistoric times . the black holes are , so to speak , the oxygen bones for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different point of view of the events in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we came out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great metal detectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of big dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I experim@@ ented with an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one year , I would say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I was afraid of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into uncomfortable situations , I forced myself to say &quot; yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start playing ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I feared , removed my fear .
my fear to keep talking , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my life has changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was a certain yes , which changed my life deeply , to an unexpected kind . it started with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons , &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if it were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my be@@ ak cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she asked me whether I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
from then on I swear to always play with them once you ask me . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , on our family .
but it also has a start@@ ling side effect : first of all , I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; statement for playing with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think of things , stir you up to life .
dream job .
no .
I &apos;m a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I produce television .
I make television , on a large scale .
in this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are in production at the same time .
each broadcast provides hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode all nine days of four shows , thus every nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts that are simultaneously in production : 24 episodes : grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 Hours Television ,
350 million dollars for one season .
in America my TV series runs one after the other on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are programmes that I have created myself , and not only produced , so on top of that . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire burning around the world .
do you know who else is doing that ?
no one , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think , when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you that all of you who work so hard , whether you run a company , a country or a classroom , take a business or a household , take me seriously when I speak of work , so you understand that I &apos;m not just getting around on the computer and f@@ anci@@ ful , and it &apos;s true when I say : I do not understand that it &apos;s not dre@@ aming about a dream job .
it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , everything sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I am absorbed in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
it is as if I set up troops when I painted on a canvas .
as if you wear a high sound , run a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
she is creative , mechanical , ti@@ ring and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing about it is the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
there is such a change in me when the work goes well .
a bu@@ zz starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz@@ ing sounds like a busy road , I could drive on it forever .
many people assume that I explain to them the sums that I &apos;m writing to write that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t get me wrong , it does .
but the bu@@ zz -- when I started working and working and making , building , creating and working , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy . the bu@@ zz !
the sum is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz , you can &apos;t asp@@ ire otherwise than by size .
the feeling of not being different than striving for great@@ ness , no matter what price .
this is called sums .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it &apos;s called Gen@@ ie .
perhaps it is ego .
maybe it &apos;s the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I only know that I love the bu@@ zz .
I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make one thing clear : the more I become more successful , the more episodes I get , the more work there is , the more things I watch , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I created , the marathon that I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the hum@@ ming , the hum@@ ming , the hum@@ ming .
I like this bu@@ zz . I love the bu@@ zz .
I need the money . I am the sum .
am I just this bu@@ zz ?
and then the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
revised , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burned out .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mo@@ m is a single work title .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mo@@ m will not be there , but you can write to my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are Baby @-@ Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the bu@@ zz@@ ing ceased .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of the engine was silent .
I didn &apos;t love my job any more . the engine was out .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no regre@@ ts , nothing deleg@@ ate , a titanium does not sleep , does not give up , with all the heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no bu@@ zz .
within me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a showcase @-@ Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no more fun .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the bu@@ zz I was .
so what do you do if what you do , the work you love suddenly fade away ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ ish you , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you are doing it , you are working , you love what you are doing , being a teacher , being a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives you the bu@@ zz when you know the bu@@ zz , when you stop the bu@@ zz , who is you ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late , and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no , when two things become aware of me :
first , I must say Yes to all and secondly , she did not call me &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she doesn &apos;t call anyone any more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did that happen ?
I miss it when I &apos;m Titan and my bu@@ zz is bet@@ ting , and everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about this .
we play and her sisters b@@ ump into it , we laugh a lot and I read dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in sol@@ itude and in the absence of the sum , I can do nothing but watch out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the land I created , the marathon that I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they no longer exist .
everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it &apos;s about letting go , or whatever the girl gets in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere peace and simplicity are everywhere .
the air in this place is so tight that I can barely breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in .
and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens , it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz is slowly coming back .
no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the bu@@ zz@@ ing , but a bu@@ zz .
and now I feel as if I know a magic secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the working environment , the titanium dioxide , this is just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself with the help of broad@@ casts and television hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is .
the sum is not a force and it is not labor @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz is dependent on love .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing is the current which comes from the lust of life .
the real bu@@ zz is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real bu@@ zz@@ ing ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , because what god told me that I am a Titan ?
it &apos;s just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes .
I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself from any blame as a work@@ ah@@ olic .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the bu@@ zz@@ ing again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in games , I don &apos;t like it .
I don &apos;t seem to play as much as they work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to work at the workplace than at home .
this admission is painful , because what a human being rather works as being at home ?
well , I am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of it .
we are walking around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
at the same time I feel overwhel@@ m@@ ingly stiff , absent and confused .
I always use my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
my children show me how to live and the tot@@ ality of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you think me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you &apos;re right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or cookie replaces me .
and talking to my teen@@ ie daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , but there is no need for it .
everyone can get 15 minutes on the track , even on a bad mood !
15 minutes a day !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to pray .
but 15 minutes are in it !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it is not necessary to be the children . it is necessary to feel the tot@@ ality of having a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and keep it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;m leaving and I won . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes at the track , why not take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz@@ ing came back in my free time . the bu@@ zz@@ ing seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
work does not work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months , a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . it leads me to new ideas .
I like the bu@@ zz , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my sum .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of life .
the tot@@ ality of love .
the sum of the work is part of me , but only a part . and I am so grateful for that .
it &apos;s snap to me that I &apos;m a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my bon@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children are .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clearer is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the bu@@ zz . the land I create , the marathon , which I run , the troops , the screens , the high sound , the hum@@ ming , the hum@@ ming , the other , the real bu@@ zz@@ ing : the bu@@ zz@@ ing of life .
the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more this unusual , dying , naked and new feeling of life spreads in me . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel this sums , the more I know who I am .
I am a writer . I think things look like , I &apos;ll stir you up to life .
this is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a bit dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to another after a heavy stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other organs , has a very low self healing capability .
after severe injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional Neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical measures .
they have probably heard of one of the most well known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; in doing so , an electrode is im@@ planted deep in the brain in order to influence the neur@@ ons &apos; circuits in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function is improved .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease , suffering from severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help , the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often provided patients with skull trauma .
they have to imagine that brain trau@@ mata sw@@ ells up the brain and the cran@@ ial pressure rises .
in order to save life , it is necessary to reduce the cran@@ ial pressure .
for this you sometimes have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to small children that are taken out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity , and environments to prosp@@ er .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François succeeded .
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
you may still know from the biology classes that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they spread slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have it in our brain .
they consist of 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the embry@@ onic stage they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why do they get us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so certain .
one thing is clear , however -- from these cells we got our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a bit of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and then color them in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
in the final step , we en@@ anti@@ ated it at the withdrawal point of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- auto@@ graph transplantation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we reim@@ port these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we reim@@ port the same cells into damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario we reim@@ plant@@ ated the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed again , they go back home .
in the second scenario we added a violation and reim@@ plant@@ ated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained intact -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been reim@@ plant@@ ated .
the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells that we in vitro propag@@ ated in culture .
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take feed pellets from a tray .
they did it very well .
when they reached a stable skill level , we injured the motor motor area in the motor cor@@ tex .
as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand .
exactly as it would happen in humans , they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic bra@@ in@@ washing mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just like the monkey .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted its own cells .
on the left , they see the monkey who spontaneously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from prior to injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now see when we re @-@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the her@@ m@@ plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to implant them in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Giuss@@ ani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need it . &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials on humans .
Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results , you have to fill in about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate and so on .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply this to a multi@@ center study .
first you really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self @-@ evident .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to look at them as imm@@ utable .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his big im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy f@@ uses with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistak@@ ably made clear to me as the finance minister in the Euro Group that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- should not affect the austerity programs implemented in Greece .
at that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my ad@@ missible friends who told me that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything .
at this point , I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group are mistaken , we could not save democracy , but that we need a genuine and defensive democracy .
for without democracy our societies are mur@@ m@@ uring , our future is dark and our great new technologies are wasted .
on the subject of waste , I would like to point out to you an interesting contradiction that currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Twin To@@ o Par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt that casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognise the mountain of debt ,
but few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unused cash that belongs to the high net worth savings and corporations , but who are too anxious to invest it where it would be productive and bring income , with which one could bear the mountain of debt and also produce all the things humanity desper@@ ately needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past three months , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars have been invested in the United States , England and the euro zone , in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so forth .
3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US Dollars sounds like a lot of money , until we compare it with the 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time were lying around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did absolutely nothing except infl@@ ating stock exchanges and raising real estate prices .
thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks which are not identical with the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ant wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low macro@@ economic demand which , as in an endless loop , reinfor@@ ces the pes@@ si@@ mis@@ m of investors who , fear@@ ing the prophecy of the O@@ mis@@ e , could be true that his son would kill him when he grew up ,
invol@@ un@@ tarily brings about the circumstances that lead to O@@ edi@@ pus to kill him .
this is my con@@ tention with capitalism --
his very lav@@ ish art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and especially to fund all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth .
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue , what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy included , of course , too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to dimin@@ ish the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy because of these exclu@@ sions .
the decisive factor in the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it with@@ drew the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , that they gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same mood of voting in matters of state concerns .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long --
like a candle that g@@ lows very brigh@@ tly , it is also quickly burnt out .
however , our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on free citizens and reinforced the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a by@@ word for rulers .
for the liberal democracy came up only when a complete separation of politics and business was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- that is , the world of the corporations -- became a democratic zone .
in our demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economics began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two takes place , by gradually under@@ mining politics and em@@ power@@ ing them .
do you wonder why politicians are no longer as they used to be ?
it is not part of a degeneration of their DNA .
it is because nowadays it is possible to be in the government and still not in power because the power is ander@@ ed away from politics into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my dis@@ cord with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is about like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es , which has so sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals they feed on , that they are star@@ ving at the end .
similarly , it is with the economy that has har@@ assed politics so far that it hur@@ ts itself through the self @-@ created economic crisis . the power of the corporations is growing , political goods are being de@@ valued , the ine@@ quality falls , the general economic demand falls , and the managing directors of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; out of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity .
if that is true , it is obvious that we must re@@ assemble the policies and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; keep control as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Mar@@ xi@@ an left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go very well .
the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can regain a position as in ancient Athens by a miracle without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
but there is one solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers by automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks hei@@ gh@@ tened , the waste gained , and the social conflicts still deeper , just as it -- very soon , as I believe -- will come in countries like China .
we must therefore resh@@ ape the economy and re@@ unite the sectors of economy and politics , and make sure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the movie &quot; Matrix &quot; like a documentary .
the question therefore is not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements that it has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia similar to that of &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines serve human beings and people put their energy into the exploration of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long discussions the sense of life indul@@ ges .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so what would it be like to have this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples in brief .
in the area of companies : please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows from one job to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter which one is working -- is the property of those currently working in the company .
then all income deri@@ ves from capital and from redemption and the concept of wage labour is completely obsol@@ ete .
no distinction between those who belong , but who do not work in it , and employees working there , but which the company does not belong . no more exchange between capital and labor , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no standing twin peaks .
in the sphere of global political economy , please make sure that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency expressed by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that the whole world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cosmos &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cosmos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- and each government pays the sum equivalent to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the country into a common fund . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed at the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it wasn &apos;t the technical means to implement it .
today we have them , especially against the backdrop of a re@@ unified policy and economy .
the world I describe to you is at the same time liberal , in which it fav@@ ours privileged persons , and Marxist , because they will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the rub@@ b@@ ish of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global Key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all else , it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Giuss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and business is ... Do we not do that , technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers term refers to as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next as we experience it , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is correct , Marx is quite relevant ,
just like Ha@@ ye@@ k , that &apos;s why I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that is why I am also perfect .
BG : indeed , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t think you &apos;re not thinking enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your presentation , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the or@@ ators you have said very clearly what you think about the West &apos;s view on China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of democracy .
as I said in my presentation , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays is - the sphere of economy -- a completely democratic zone .
in a sense , if I can say this so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China resembles the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , as John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical about democratic development .
what can now be observed in China is very similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now preparing to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am sure many listeners are curious about their experiences as Greece &apos;s Treas@@ ury Secretary at the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ V : I guess that &apos;s coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back to the first half of the year six months later ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to make a new start with the euro zone ,
not only Greece but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to say good @-@ bye to our self @-@ compl@@ ac@@ ency and the permanent den@@ ial that a massive throw @-@ off line went through the euro@@ zone , and continues , which threat@@ ens the development of the whole European Union massi@@ vely . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal that revealed this den@@ ial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro zone , within the European group , continued to den@@ ounce the den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable to live through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , you may be able to delay it for a while , but when the changes happen , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you anticipate ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its construction .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Seri@@ ously ...
if there is a minister of finance , or any minister who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he did not make any mistakes , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the sponsors to find a common solution .
but there was no such thing .
they merely wanted to bring our government down , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that ran out of the Eurozone .
they did not want to admit that they had been implementing a disa@@ strous programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika who imposed this policy on us was : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive .
for if it does not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 what it seems to me , it will also be det@@ ri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ European . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : we hope you &apos;re wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you so much for being with TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
of Roy Price most have never heard before , although he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minute , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision that Roy hit three years ago .
Roy price is executive employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an icon of hed@@ geho@@ g and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movies , TV , technique , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and content that Amazon is producing .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy do not have any choice .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right corner of this corner .
this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this rating will receive .
if your show is judged with nine and higher , it is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Break@@ ing Bad &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- all the shows that make you addic@@ ted , where after you looked at a relay , your brain asks : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- which should tell you enough what &apos;s going on at this end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roy price doesn &apos;t worry about getting to the left side of the corner because I think you need special intelligence to accommodate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has more thoughts about the middle ou@@ ting , average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t inspire .
so he must make sure he is really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time Amazon makes something , so Roy price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything .
he wants to create success .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where they can watch it for free .
and if Amazon releases things for nothing , you get too , right ?
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
however , they do not know they are observed when watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who pick up everything .
you record when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you jump over or look again .
they collect millions of data to decide with these data then which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com via four Republi@@ can US Sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that many don &apos;t remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good .
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked for .
about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always on the look@@ out to find them a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different .
instead of organizing a competition , he and his team have viewed the available data on the Net@@ fli@@ x Viewer , so the reviews they give to the shows their course of which shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : which shows they like , which producers , what actors .
when they had all the parts together , they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com via four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
now , of course , the question is : what has happened here ?
there are two very competitive , data @-@ sealed companies .
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic says that it should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data for a decision you make , you should make a good decision .
it has 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work so , then this is a little frigh@@ tening because we live in a time when we use more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond TV .
does anybody know the multi @-@ health system ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one ever comes into contact with this software in this room . come into contact with it , you are in prison .
if someone is in jail in the USA and asks for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ miss@@ al is carried out or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate TV , 22 minutes , it can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are produced . that &apos;s not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data of the most experienced companies are also wrong .
yes , even Google makes mistakes sometimes .
in 2009 , Google announced that data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the worst kind , can predict -- through data analysis of Google searches .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked flaw@@ lessly , year by year , until suddenly it didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it simply didn &apos;t work , this was a sensation again , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data of the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data flow into decisions of life -- at work , in law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very clever people use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably many data to make serious choices , such as the decision for a cancer therapy
over the years , I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you have to solve a complex problem , do two things :
first , you dis@@ assemble this problem into its parts so that you can analyse the items ; as a second , you put the items together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put it together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it all : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good it is necessary to assemble parts and pieces again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and mind where they belong also in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they would not have been capable of . but the decision on how to take all these parts again and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; does not stand in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first when they comp@@ eted for TV ideas , then selecting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a show . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data begin to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and to not forget this , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a ja@@ - or no @-@ issue you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will use a technical demo later .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , with which I should have listened to the ball afterwards .
but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you want to replace it with something much smar@@ ter than data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
in the end it &apos;s up to us to make decisions if we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as a very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions , to be an expert in what you do , and take risks .
for in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
