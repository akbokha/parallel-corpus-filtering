<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA illegally listened to telephones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic U.S. intelligence operation in which the CIA literally delivered drafts for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If this sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government has established itself against Risen and called upon him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern of condemning whistleblower and spying journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the first constitutional amendment, the media have the right to publish confidential information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to use this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous ones who reveal it.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked on Risen, he did something that many brave reporters had already done before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, even though they had given indications for years that it would be essential in their case, the demands of the government of Risen were dropped.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic surveillance, the reporters and sources can hide themselves less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of excreting and risking forward risings, they could also do his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, were secretly worried about his telephone calls,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, financial and bank information, his credit history, and even travel tips with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey sterling, a CIA whistleblower and Risen's alleged source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to defend whistleblower. instead, the judiciary condemned more than all US governments before him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government downgraded too much of its work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11 almost every article about national security was the result of a whistleblower went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional amendment, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as the government's technology allows the government to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And they can do so from the moment they get in touch, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software that didn't exist when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">One such technology is Securedrop, an open source transfer system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and today has been developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news site like the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, just like with any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the relevant news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer procure information secretly, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the start.</seg>
<seg id="36">Securedrop, however, is only a small part of the whole to protect freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new espionage technologies that jeopardize us all.</seg>
<seg id="38">It's up to us to make sure that not only technologists like Edward Snowden have a chance to bring misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">Who knows about grievances in the supply of soldiers and wants to report about crowded hospitals. or the nearest environmenter who sends alarm to the contaminated water of Flint. or a wall-street insider who warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "at least, these technologies have not only been made for those who want to expose themselves to crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016 the biggest data leak of history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" reveal that empires and powerful] [enormous sums of money have hidden in tax havens.] [what does this mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to give an explanation.]</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already lead to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has mailbox companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a trace of $2 billion will lead Russia's President Vladimir Putin to a close friend of children's days, a famous cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others waiting nervously for the next release, and the next reveal documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems weep away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their fortunes in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax havens are used by a few to hide and veil their fortunes -- something that we have been discussing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem to be very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a matryjog doll.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society to really understand what is happening.</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there were no prominent Americans in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it's not that there are no wealthy Americans hiding their fortunes in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But due to the principle that these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is such that in some US states it takes less information to provide less information to establish a company than to obtain a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">"" "" "" "this kind of intransparency in the US allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children." ""</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed fraudsters to rip off especially vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">It really shocked us that all except one lawyer made proposals for our investigator how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these attorneys accepted us as clients, and of course nobody was given money to anyone. however, it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single top politician involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we need to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "we need to change the rules to complicate this type of behavior." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">That may sound very evil as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing had ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and the powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist I see that things have begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the past few years, we have seen pushing for more transparency regarding the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU registers in central registers on a national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US lagged behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in the two parliamentarians, but this does not make progress that we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bogus companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need leaders in business to get up and say:" "" "intransparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and advocate to end this kind of transparency by law." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "together we can finally stop the transparency which now enables this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I was almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I went back home.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just had a roadtrip across the country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me enthusiastically how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It got late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "and I thought," "" "Oh, man!" ""</seg>
<seg id="106">What am I supposed to do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a place to sleep?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans this. I don't want to be kidnapped in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard me say:" "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "one voice in my head said," "" "See how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">"" "at night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought," "" "Oh man! what did I rock myself?" ""</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">"" "what if he's crazy?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I got out of bed, embarrassed at the tips of the door, and closed my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he wasn't crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he bought from me hangs today in his classrooms. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Maybe the people who were sold to me in childhood were friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To house people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a time leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost broke, my roommate pulls out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could make something about it. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk including a mattress and each morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and thus created so-called "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRB and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure, our cheese-ham-omelettes tasted completely different because we did it for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We were touring with them throughout the city. when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I stared at us.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former fellow, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if we could make a business concept out of it.</seg>
<seg id="138">This is what we presented to investors: "we want to create a website where people post public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can then invite stranger people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We were waiting for the missile to fire.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they are not.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody who is still in consolation would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we have learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you look at things that you can do well. we were able to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Arts we had learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create an immense trust through design, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taste of the degree of confidence we have entrenched.</seg>
<seg id="152">It's a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone in your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked cell phone to your left-hand neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent approach to panic that you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in the hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who actually has Al Gores mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he is running for the President of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first introduced himself to his name; if he had told you where he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 judgements that all say: "he can really capture really well-locked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you would have to give up your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought out feedback system strengthens trust decisively.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we have done some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for the people to dispense with negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both host and guest left their assessments before we set them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how much they are in terms of age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Not surprisingly, we trust people most, who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting if you add a person's call -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three assessments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stands out in common.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you tell too little, such as" "" "Hi!" "", "you don't get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "one can tell too much, for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother" "" "-- -- -- the request is not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">"" "so there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." "" "Great art works in your apartment! I'm going on vacation with my family." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How do you manage to create this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which subjects you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we had not reckoned with was the great amount of people who were more than willing to dispose of these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First of all: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Thirdly, a demand that had previously not been covered.</seg>
<seg id="200">The business is running very well for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when everything runs smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who were not allowed to party parties or have devastated homes.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I was at the forefront when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hears in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, of the 123 million nights, only a fraction of a problem had ever been encountered.</seg>
<seg id="209">For men have confidence in one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, it can result in miracles.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"" "" "" "perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities." ""</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives, even though they don't know one at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring your books.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer without charging the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course not every stay expires.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of sharing work together with monetary transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">"" "" "" "it's about economic trading." ""</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but now it is easy to call" "" "rental industry" "", "the thing is not fair." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade which promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People place a part of themselves openly, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today, you can compare it with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in any place you visited a group there would be waiting for it to fill it thoroughly and to show you in a pub-tour quarter of which you have never heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Today, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from the ground up to the other?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of sharing?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that enable us to society and relationships instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces that belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were offered now residents. students looking for a place to stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were imparted to people whose children were moved out. incubators programs were started,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to be able to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone, 785,000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even a host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was there before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar sites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we realized that with the components of trust you can find the right design.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find this amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I must think about it every time a red Mazda passes by me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this big impact, I wonder what we can use in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, brainwashing, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay at the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media are people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study found that 80% of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A wannabe-fitness fanatic,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not as Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born so.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I decided to oust myself.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear the hijab, my head covering.</seg>

<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast in the end, looked at the screen and saw the word "breaking News."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, airplanes flew into buildings, people jumped out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>

<seg id="323">They speak of my church as from a tumor in the body of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know that a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumour is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless, because the question is false.</seg>
<seg id="327">Like all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumour in the body of the United States, but a vital organ.</seg>

<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to a more tolerant view of people of other faiths and to show greater citizen participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington, DC area recently told me that people are actually not being radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">During the radicalization process it has been established that it starts online. first, the person is cut off from their congregation, even from their family, so that the extremists may make a brainwashing that leads to the person believing that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or disliked by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop people from going to the mosque.</seg>

<seg id="346">An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was just the opposite. every minister with whom she spoke brought her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing, and something that would have made sense to their anger, it was a major goal for the instrumentalization of extremists who promised it a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam re-established the connection with God and His church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed their constructive way for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how the Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, to our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept rather an authoritarian regime, conformity and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows that if you submit news in which negative about Muslims were reported, they were more likely to attack military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the pruning of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look when the mood against Muslims pushed upward -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in the context of terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two electoral periods.</seg>

<seg id="409">Before air package delivery penetrated our social awareness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the Frac Centre in France has built a six-meter high tower of 1 500 tiles live in front of the audience. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting to each other, flying devices achieve high speed and acceleration in the tightest of spaces.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-winding structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to bear burdens, to deal with turbulence and to react in general to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to transcend the limits of possibility in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to operate autonomously, it has to know collectively where the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects, which enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new location technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space, determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are on the highest level. for example," "" "start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called hedgehog,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flying machine trying to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in the forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starters it can float, and thus has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of hedge starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence such as wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind this is that it doesn't matter in which position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions which penetrate the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">For example, what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remote-controlled aircraft that only had two movable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">We discovered that flying is working with only one.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospner, the mechanically easiest Remote controlled Flight Device. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and transverse rubs, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is simple, in the inner life very much happens so that it can fly stable and move in space everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="440">However, it does not have the elegant tailgate algorithm. to make it fly, I have to throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The odds of throwing it right when all of you are watching is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the monospary is an exercise in amusement, this machine here, the Omnikopter with its eight propellers, is an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore, it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">Through this he receives the audacious ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions, no matter which direction it is rotated or even as it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some things can be imagined in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at that.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they have to be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two-propeller flying machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">But if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller fails, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly, albeit limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by making one-half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took standard Micro-Quadcopter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where it is in the room and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe press over there wants to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For guys like us the reward lies in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that it allows creative, smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago two black holes circled around each other in a very remote galaxy; they turned the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment they lit more brightly than all the stars along in all the galaxies of the entire known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">Their energy, however, did not set them free in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">Finally, we speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was released into space-time-structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us first arrange the events in time.</seg>
<seg id="476">More than 1.3 billion years ago, there was just multi-cell life on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God stands with us -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from the MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector, to look for gravitational waves, which are formed by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, construction, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the laser-interferometer- gravitational-waves observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following period, the precision of Ligo could be significantly increased, which greatly improved the detection capacity.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015 Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, just a few days after the detector went into operation, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes drilled through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of My Daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, it was the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been investigating gravitational waves from black holes and their signals measurable by observatories for 23 years. but what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a rift in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When moving the shaft, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and stowed in the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For the sake of illustration, instructors in courses for relativity play a real causal dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14th, for example, each of us was stretched and gested at the arrival of the waves. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That means 20 zeros after comma followed by a 1. that's why one declared the Ligo employees crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometer laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be measured in less than a thousandth of the radius of a nucleus. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical lyrics about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "described Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, the hunt for the waves as follows:" "" "the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to say that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your mobile.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because so you can create a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">With sounds this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that are particularly important to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">About your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain properties like pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now Alice is talking." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"" "" "" "and Bob stops them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the all speaking.</seg>
<seg id="522">To listen to the gravity can tell us much about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been working very long already.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, chirping simply: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">The two bodies turn very fast, you hear the same circus with an additional key change. that sounds like the wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [Surrender noise] somebody who knows what to listen to, knows this as sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-times solar mass, which spin around as quickly as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's consider what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns are circling a hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know that because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">This is the permanent meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a whole new way to explore the universe as it was never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can't see -- virtually or principally -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in supernovae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes occur at the core, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through because these are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it, because the Big Bang is hidden by its own night light.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the help of gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And most importantly, I am optimistic that there are things we have never seen before, which we have never seen and of which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact Ligo found things right in the first attempt that we didn't expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the League project, says on this subject: me: the kind of stars that reveal black holes how Ligo watches them are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are, so to speak, the oxygen bones for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo gives us a completely different point of view of the events in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we came out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great metal detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of big dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I experimented with an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for one year, I would say," "" "Yes!" "" "that I was afraid of." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it made me nervous, brought me into uncomfortable situations, I forced myself to say "yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I feared, removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear to keep talking, my social anxiety -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes," "" "my life has changed." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"" "" "" "yes," "" "changed me." ""</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes, which changed my life deeply, to an unexpected kind. it started with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" "" "kittens" "" "for inexplicable reasons," ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if it were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "kittens, I need milk for my beak cup." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked me whether I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">From then on I swear to always play with them once you ask me. no matter what I am doing, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm very tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a startling side effect: first of all, I fully understood that the "yes" statement for playing with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am a writer. I think of things, stir you up to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I'm a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, on a large scale.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are in production at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each broadcast provides hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode all nine days of four shows, thus every nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts that are simultaneously in production: 24 episodes: grey's, 21 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 Hours Television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for one season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series runs one after the other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are programmes that I have created myself, and not only produced, so on top of that. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who else is doing that?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, that's why I'm a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">"" "I say it because I know what you think, when the word" "" "author" "" "falls." ""</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you that all of you who work so hard, whether you run a company, a country or a classroom, take a business or a household, take me seriously when I speak of work, so you understand that I'm not just getting around on the computer and fanciful, and it's true when I say: I do not understand that it's not dreaming about a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It is all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, everything sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am absorbed in the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as if I set up troops when I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As if you wear a high sound, run a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">She is creative, mechanical, tiring and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing about it is the buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work goes well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzzing sounds like a busy road, I could drive on it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume that I explain to them the sums that I'm writing to write that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't get me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the buzz -- when I started working and working and making, building, creating and working, I discovered this thing, this sum, this energy. the buzz!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The buzzing is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz, you can't aspire otherwise than by size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being different than striving for greatness, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it's called Genie.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Maybe it's the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I'm not made for failure, and I only know that I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make one thing clear: the more I become more successful, the more episodes I get, the more work there is, the more things I watch, the more I write history, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I created, the marathon that I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the humming, the humming, the humming.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzz. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the money. I am the sum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzzing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overloaded, exaggerated, burned out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzzing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mom is a single work title.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom will not be there, but you can write to my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says:" "" "kitten, I want to go to Shonda country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby-Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the buzzing ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzzing of the engine was silent.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job any more. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The buzzing did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, worked weekends, no regrets, nothing delegate, a titanium does not sleep, does not give up, with all the heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzz.</seg>
<seg id="655">Within me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a showcase-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no more fun.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the buzz I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do, the work you love suddenly fade away?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think," "" "Wish you, stupid author-Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you are doing it, you are working, you love what you are doing, being a teacher, being a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives you the buzz when you know the buzz, when you stop the buzz, who is you?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern states waitress" "" "asks me a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I'm on the way out, late, and she says," "" "Mum, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no, when two things become aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I must say Yes to all and secondly, she did not call me "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "she doesn't call anyone any more" "" "kittens" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I'm Titan and my buzz is betting, and everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mum, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "and I say," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about this.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and her sisters bump into it, we laugh a lot and I read dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and panic, in solitude and in the absence of the sum, I can do nothing but watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land I created, the marathon that I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it's about letting go, or whatever the girl gets in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere peace and simplicity are everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so tight that I can barely breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that doesn't happen immediately, but it happens, it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz is slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, barely there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzzing, but a buzz.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magic secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The buzzing, the working environment, the titanium dioxide, this is just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself with the help of broadcasts and television hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sum is not a force and it is not labor-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzzing is the current which comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real buzz is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real buzzing ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the wrong words, because what god told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It's just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself from any blame as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the buzzing again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in games, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">I don't seem to play as much as they work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at the workplace than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what a human being rather works as being at home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I am.</seg>
<seg id="728">"" "honestly, I call myself" "" "Titan" "" "--" ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">We are walking around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">At the same time I feel overwhelmingly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always use my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live and the totality of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you think me naive, for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You're right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybird or cookie replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And talking to my teenie daughter for 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, but there is no need for it.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can get 15 minutes on the track, even on a bad mood!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a day!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready to pray.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my well-being, my world. it is not necessary to be the children. it is necessary to feel the totality of having a place for peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "to" "" "play" "" "in general." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I'm leaving and I won. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"" "" "" "do you want to play?" "" "is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training when I wanted to surpass myself more and more." ""</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes at the track, why not take full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzzing came back in my free time. the buzzing seems to return if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months, a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul. it leads me to new ideas.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the buzz, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the buzzing, the buzz is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sum.</seg>
<seg id="775">The buzzing of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The totality of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sum of the work is part of me, but only a part. and I am so grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">It's snap to me that I'm a Titan. I've never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functioning. my bonfires are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children are.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the clearer is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the buzz. the land I create, the marathon, which I run, the troops, the screens, the high sound, the humming, the humming, the other, the real buzzing: the buzzing of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this humming, the more this unusual, dying, naked and new feeling of life spreads in me. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel this sums, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am a writer. I think things look like, I'll stir you up to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is part of the job, which means living his dream.</seg>

<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another after a heavy stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other organs, has a very low self healing capability.</seg>
<seg id="800">After severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">They have probably heard of one of the most well known, the "deep brain stimulation." in doing so, an electrode is implanted deep in the brain in order to influence the neurons' circuits in such a way that the neurological function is improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease, suffering from severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation, however, does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often provided patients with skull trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that brain traumata swells up the brain and the cranial pressure rises.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save life, it is necessary to reduce the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">For this you sometimes have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity, and environments to prosper.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">You may still know from the biology classes that stem cells are immature cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They spread slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have it in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They consist of 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the embryonic stage they provide for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they get us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so certain.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear, however -- from these cells we got our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a bit of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then color them in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the final step, we enantiated it at the withdrawal point of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- autograph transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we reimport these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we reimport the same cells into damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we reimplantated the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed again, they go back home.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added a violation and reimplantated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained intact -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been reimplantated.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells that we in vitro propagated in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable skill level, we injured the motor motor area in the motor cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">As a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand.</seg>
<seg id="870">Exactly as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brainwashing mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just like the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left, they see the monkey who spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see when we re-planted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the hermplantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can need it."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results, you have to fill in about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate and so on.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply this to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">First you really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at them as immutable.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his big imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy fuses with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistakably made clear to me as the finance minister in the Euro Group that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- should not affect the austerity programs implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my admissible friends who told me that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point, I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup are mistaken, we could not save democracy, but that we need a genuine and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy our societies are murmuring, our future is dark and our great new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste, I would like to point out to you an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "Twin Too Paradox." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt that casts its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognise the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash that belongs to the high net worth savings and corporations, but who are too anxious to invest it where it would be productive and bring income, with which one could bear the mountain of debt and also produce all the things humanity desperately needs, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past three months, 3,4 trillion dollars have been invested in the United States, England and the euro zone, in all the wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US Dollars sounds like a lot of money, until we compare it with the 5.1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time were lying around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did absolutely nothing except inflating stock exchanges and raising real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debts and unproductive capital form the twin peaks which are not identical with the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnant wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low macroeconomic demand which, as in an endless loop, reinforces the pessimism of investors who, fearing the prophecy of the Omise, could be true that his son would kill him when he grew up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Involuntarily brings about the circumstances that lead to Oedipus to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my contention with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His very lavish art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents and especially to fund all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue, what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy included, of course, too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to diminish the significance of the Athenian democracy because of these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive factor in the Athenian democracy was and is that it withdrew the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, that they gave them the right to political co-determination with the same mood of voting in matters of state concerns.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy did not last long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that glows very brightly, it is also quickly burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy focused on free citizens and reinforced the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a byword for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy came up only when a complete separation of politics and business was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- that is, the world of the corporations -- became a democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economics began, a relentless struggle between the two takes place, by gradually undermining politics and empowering them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer as they used to be?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not part of a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because nowadays it is possible to be in the government and still not in power because the power is andered away from politics into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my discord with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is about like a herd of carnivores, which has so sustainably decimated the animals they feed on, that they are starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is with the economy that has harassed politics so far that it hurts itself through the self-created economic crisis. the power of the corporations is growing, political goods are being devalued, the inequality falls, the general economic demand falls, and the managing directors of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism drives the "demos" out of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we must reassemble the policies and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" keep control as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxian left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can regain a position as in ancient Athens by a miracle without creating new forms of brutality and extravagance.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks heightened, the waste gained, and the social conflicts still deeper, just as it -- very soon, as I believe -- will come in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">We must therefore reshape the economy and reunite the sectors of economy and politics, and make sure that we democratize the reunified area, otherwise we end up in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy, which makes the movie "Matrix" like a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question therefore is not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements that it has produced --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia similar to that of "Star Trek," in which machines serve human beings and people put their energy into the exploration of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athener "Agora," in long discussions the sense of life indulges.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"" "so what would it be like to have this" "" "Star Trek" "" "like utopia instead of the" "" "Matrix" "" "like dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples in brief.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of companies: please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows from one job to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter which one is working -- is the property of those currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income derives from capital and from redemption and the concept of wage labour is completely obsolete.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong, but who do not work in it, and employees working there, but which the company does not belong. no more exchange between capital and labor, no large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no standing twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the sphere of global political economy, please make sure that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency expressed by the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">"" "imagine that the whole world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" "" "the cosmos" "", "in units of" "" "cosmos" "" "-- and each government pays the sum equivalent to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the country into a common fund." ""</seg>
<seg id="967">"" "imagine that this fund invests in" "" "green" "" "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare." ""</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed at the Bretton Woods Conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it wasn't the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have them, especially against the backdrop of a reunified policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe to you is at the same time liberal, in which it favours privileged persons, and Marxist, because they will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the rubbish of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else, it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or will we sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and business is... Do we not do that, technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers term refers to as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next as we experience it, it will not only destabilise our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is correct, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, that's why I am a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and that is why I am also perfect.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: indeed, and now we are.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't think you're not thinking enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your presentation, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the orators you have said very clearly what you think about the West's view on China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my presentation, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it plays is - the sphere of economy -- a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a sense, if I can say this so provocative, China resembles the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What can now be observed in China is very similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China is now preparing to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">"" "" "" "I am sure many listeners are curious about their experiences as Greece's Treasury Secretary at the beginning of the year." ""</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I guess that's coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back to the first half of the year six months later?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new start with the euro zone,</seg>

<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable to live through political will and authoritarianism in life, you may be able to delay it for a while, but when the changes happen, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you anticipate?</seg>

<seg id="1038">Of Roy Price most have never heard before, although he is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minute, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy hit three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy price is executive employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has an icon of hedgehog and describes himself on Twitter as" "" "movies, TV, technique, tacos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and content that Amazon is producing.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy do not have any choice.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are on the right corner of this corner.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this rating will receive.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is judged with nine and higher, it is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"" "these are shows like" "" "Breaking Bad" "", "" Game of Thrones, "" "" "The Wire" "" "-- all the shows that make you addicted, where after you looked at a relay, your brain asks:" "" "where are there more of these episodes?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "on the left, here at this end, shows like" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "" "-- -- which should tell you enough what's going on at this end of the curve." ""</seg>
<seg id="1055">"" "Roy price doesn't worry about getting to the left side of the corner because I think you need special intelligence to accommodate" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">He has more thoughts about the middle outing, average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it's the first time Amazon makes something, so Roy price doesn't want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online, where they can watch it for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon releases things for nothing, you get too, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know they are observed when watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who pick up everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You record when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you jump over or look again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide with these data then which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process them and this results in the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a sitcom via four Republican US Senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that many don't remember this show because it wasn't that good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked for.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always on the lookout to find them a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a bit different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of organizing a competition, he and his team have viewed the available data on the Netflix Viewer, so the reviews they give to the shows their course of which shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: which shows they like, which producers, what actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom via four senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Now, of course, the question is: what has happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">There are two very competitive, data-sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic says that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data for a decision you make, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work so, then this is a little frightening because we live in a time when we use more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond TV.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the multi-health system?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one ever comes into contact with this software in this room. come into contact with it, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in jail in the USA and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is carried out or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate TV, 22 minutes, it can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are produced. that's not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data of the most experienced companies are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google makes mistakes sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that data analysis outbreaks of flu, the worst kind, can predict -- through data analysis of Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked flawlessly, year by year, until suddenly it didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply didn't work, this was a sensation again, including the revocation of publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data flow into decisions of life -- at work, in law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very clever people use unimaginably many data to make serious choices, such as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Over the years, I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, you disassemble this problem into its parts so that you can analyse the items; as a second, you put the items together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put it together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to dismantle a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all possess it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good it is necessary to assemble parts and pieces again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and mind where they belong also in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what they would not have been capable of. but the decision on how to take all these parts again and make a show like "House of Cards" does not stand in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"" "they used data to control all their decisions, first when they competed for TV ideas, then selecting" "" "Alpha House" "" "as a show." ""</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "they tell us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data begin to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and to not forget this, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it is also called" "" "Magic 8 Ball" "". "it's amazing. for decisions using a ja- or no-issue you just have to shake the ball to get an answer." "" "most likely" "" "-- right here at this moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will use a technical demo later.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have made some decisions in my life, with which I should have listened to the ball afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you want to replace it with something much smarter than data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">In the end it's up to us to make decisions if we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions, to be an expert in what you do, and take risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">For in the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
