Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view of the city
an Irish institution , where teenagers are to meet today .
a pit chapel , where now for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel is dig@@ ged .
farmers cultivate the former ground of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories .
it gets nervous when maps are not up to date .
everybody knows this , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the state government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but especially therefore very informative .
especially when comparing them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich @-@ based Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work that one does not recognize as such .
in the large overview map , detailed maps , so @-@ called pri@@ me@@ val sheets , were incorporated into cities and municipalities .
according to the Bavarian survey administration , these were created between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first survey in Bavaria .
her principal : Napoleon .
the French army leader had occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops finally moved away with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from February 9 , 18@@ 01 , it was today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV Joseph promoted the project further , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographical Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian survey administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the composition sheet for Munich dates back to the year 18@@ 56 and is to be found on the homepage of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek .
the comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was joined as a Munich subur@@ b 21 years after the map was created .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of Lower Saxony are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the current Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was only named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today is the West@@ park , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : at the entrance there appears a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbered plots of the so @-@ called &quot; pri@@ me@@ val &quot; from which the base tax was derived .
today , small plots do not show farmers any more - but farmers of the plant &quot; land in the sun . &quot;
a large green area is situated north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the setting of the Oktober@@ fest since 18@@ 10 , was indeed still a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of Is@@ ar , the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of the district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen - but also in big letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße , one once locked people with ins@@ anity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich Circle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was created at the Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed the establishment of the psychiat@@ rist , who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and , for example , ended the accus@@ ations of the so @-@ called Irish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also prohibited the personnel from using violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients there was first place , later it was extended to 500 places .
at some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ rence Institution in Haar , 1905 .
the Is@@ ar Amp@@ er Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts since 2006 , is located there since 2006 .
young people meet in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um area on the grounds of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with training facilities .
West is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich Ost , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was erected in architectural all@@ usion to the original construction of the Ir@@ ren@@ berg , which was destroyed during the Second World War in bombing ra@@ ids . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chief place &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a great one remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English institute , small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days the prepar@@ atory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line @-@ line will take place .
with the sli@@ der you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil Rights Group publishes Travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the promotion of coloured people has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is scheduled to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls on af@@ ro @-@ American travellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ ians to pay special attention when travelling across the state , as a number of question@@ able , race @-@ based incidents occur in recent times throughout the country and are noted here , &quot; stated in the Group &apos;s opinion .
a recently passed Bill of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to acc@@ use discrimination , as well as the state &apos;s prosec@@ uting authorities , who are dispro@@ portion@@ ately directed towards minorities , caused the group to issue the warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have bre@@ aches of civil rights that happen to humans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear discomfort in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
the group cited events like rac@@ ist offen@@ se against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no petrol at the time of the state and was det@@ ained by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i without being accused of crime .
the Council also points to a recently published report by Mis@@ sour@@ i General At@@ tor@@ ney Office , showing that in the state , black mot@@ orists will be hal@@ ted 75 percent more often than white people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chapel said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people have to be willing to bring b@@ ail money or let relatives know they &apos;re travelling through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 years of hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the Hass@@ an Report Programme of the F@@ BI , which classi@@ fy the state with respect to the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country .
the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company because of housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued warnings for Texas and Arizona , following the adoption of immigration law , comm@@ itting local law enforcement authorities to arrest people because of immigration law , which will contribute to further racial profile .
travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but recently , interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
electric fence project is elementary
the Fisch@@ bacher Wei@@ de@@ wit@@ n project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Members of Parliament Peter Weiß and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have taken a picture on the spot .
in the square yard of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U branch met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially provided insights into his farm , where he cultivated 55 hectares of law@@ ns and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and just as many k@@ itt@@ ens and shel@@ ters in five apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the alternative water@@ way for the milk of his cows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively regional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as he is also B@@ L@@ H@@ V chairman of Fisch@@ bach , he described the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fundamental importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot profit profit@@ ably on such steep areas .
the green area care for a lot of work , much needs to be worked on with the brush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental plant and managed it without chemical plant protection and fer@@ til@@ iser , even if it does not lead to bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognised the importance of the fence project and is happy about the leadership development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported .
I hope that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the areas could be extended for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue to operate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often in criticism because of the promotion
in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants .
the disclosure area is therefore 40 hectares , which must not be for@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total costs of 71 500 Euro , half of the participants were fo@@ stered , a quarter carried the municipality of Fisch@@ bach .
thus the farmer remained 12,@@ 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of pasture fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great advantage is the durability of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and women , it &apos;s not going . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter Weiß asser@@ ted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape Care Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg permits the state support of pasture f@@ ences .
the objective is to open the Black Forest .
the prerequisite is the existence of a material that has been designated by the L@@ PR .
in addition , the area to be fenced must not be til@@ table ( slope over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by aff@@ or@@ estation .
at the moment , eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els , who want to build just 16 kilometres of fence , are currently running for the Fis@@ her@@ man &apos;s &quot; Fis@@ her@@ man &quot; project in 2018 .
the disclosure area is 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing holy anymore ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans consider them as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ m &apos;s Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the pump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the proposals of the President for the dr@@ astic reduction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller wasn &apos;t attacking the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ eers would have caught him if he had done it .
but he took on its meaning , and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when Miller A@@ co@@ sta compla@@ ined , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to go down here for a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem you refer to is added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is properly correct , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary response to the shaking words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your tired , your poor , and your oppressed masses , who long to breathe freely , / the w@@ ret@@ ched garbage of your rich shores . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mis@@ erable waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our screens was better to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Tr@@ ump USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the meaning of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is indeed a conflict of the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - were very well aware that they had accomplished a highly political action .
the sculpture was to show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn classic depic@@ tion .
Lazarus has changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a quite different name : mother of the Ex@@ iles .
the link of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus used to change the meaning of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a type of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone , but rather an early Neo@@ conserv@@ atism , bringing the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving ahead .
it is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not illumin@@ ate the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
quite unusual , Lim@@ bau@@ gh has come across something .
the meaning of the statue is quite and at all a question of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen from exhausted , el@@ event@@ h , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible travels on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and have a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they have to hear .
and of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to recognize .
their torch should not enligh@@ ten the way , but the hatred that is their only source of power .
world Cup 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the UK team
the performance director of the UK &apos;s athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship k@@ ader will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , starting on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland something special is developed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the UK must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ sch - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; Black says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought in naturally were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete in their fifth World Championships at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the Central spre@@ ader Mu@@ ir leads along this path and has set up five British and two European records last year .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man who was supposed to watch for a great season that included victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world championships when the only other Scot@@ s@@ man was Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell .
the team captain says she is &quot; enormously proud &quot; of the fact that many of her comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also be involved in med@@ als and fin@@ als .
&quot; being so special about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team @-@ mates voted for me and elected me makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I &apos;m very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes , who want to climb to po@@ di@@ ums .
what is my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blocking critics on Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you can &apos;t tolerate the dial @-@ up of voters
the father of our country knew something of a bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not last long until the newspapers beat him because of everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he dab@@ bled in criticism , certainly .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because in 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to governor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gan &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and that &apos;s why the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union su@@ ed him at the beginning of this week .
the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is particularly important if it is a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is a Republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state , which is aston@@ ish@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest agreement of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very clever to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to de@@ but@@ t his hair @-@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum which is considered officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan &apos;s spokes@@ woman Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the Gover@@ nor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too simple to use the picture of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who swing the whi@@ p online .
the post office talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no troll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful , and not prof@@ ane .
the pastor cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary area of the news broadcast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I also don &apos;t like this idea , if a number of people take a stand on the same subject , they are ignored by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the governor &apos;s staff described as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call others &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times when one had done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest and silence protest@@ ors .
but that &apos;s exactly what &apos;s happening digitally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this issue was last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit to the AC@@ L@@ U due to his use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of an affordable por@@ to had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers was multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and an anonymous pen hit the lead .
and even then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions , which critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping with Great Britain , over@@ came his office , according to the historical documents collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project .
but he has not sil@@ enced her .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means accepting this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comfort in Renaissance Club
the former European no@@ .1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comfort in the next three days since the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an holds the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year passed from Arch@@ er@@ field Links to the final round before he lost Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he laid this place .
he is an ard@@ ent advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , even though he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that really feels special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not been able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I had won it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos; a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who returned to the European Senior tour this year after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to the promotion on his homeland .
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am happy about the way it has gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer by passive smoking
over the past two decades fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer .
scientists at the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) have come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 cases of lung cancer are due to passive smoking per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chief Apostle Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this issue of 1994 .
at that time , there have been 400 lung cancer cases for passive smoking in Germany every year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new study is published in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; International Journal of Public Health &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; the construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lie reasonably in time &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Fred Hein@@ ze &apos;s director . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the area of the house @-@ connections the situation is more complicated than suspected , since there is a lot of hiding in the underground , which is not mentioned in the plans .
traffic , which repeatedly ham@@ pers the construction work , is a big problem for the construction company of St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of drivers in front of red lights and shut @-@ off switches is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road was closed and only the regular buses were allowed to drive through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were pretty exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but luckily we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z .
poverty and death in the Indonesian gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she does not use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ship in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually places a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace .
after half an hour the char@@ red tu@@ ber is removed and swal@@ lowed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the lo@@ am floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , for example to wash clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a tile room serves as lat@@ rine .
as youngest of the four wives of her husband , no fields were assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , too late to work can be dangerous : most of the villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are soldiers here .
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to walk around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occup@@ ying troops .
an existing movement , which was stirring up for independence against Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua , whereas the independent part of Papua New Guinea gr@@ asp@@ ed the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is ö@@ de . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the rented car .
there is no public transportation .
the city , with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants , consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and from wave roofs , which were converted by rust into different yel@@ low@@ ish brown tones .
only very few In@@ don@@ esi@@ ans made their trip here , let journalists and practically no foreig@@ ner .
before the Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were other changes as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright coat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and have some of the worst inf@@ ant mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high @-@ country provincial in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has min@@ ed gold and copper in value of 3.1 billion US dollars .
in addition , Papua @-@ wood resources are valued at an estimated US $ 78 billion .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Papua that ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military preserves a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid nearly 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Peru@@ vian demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped , tor@@ tured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal high@@ lands in the 1970 &quot; s have been genocide according to the Asia Human Rights Commission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the region alone , Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Wer@@ den Every@@ thing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is said in a report by the Arch@@ dio@@ c@@ ese Bris@@ ban@@ e of 2016 , which reports about the atro@@ cities of the previous year , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric attacks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims each week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Human Rights Watch .
the screws have increased , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources produce an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is up to 83 % Christian , but demographic developments are changing because Muslim economic migrants come from the densely populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ bling cant@@ e@@ ens sell roasted chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served .
local people are struggling to stay here .
&quot; migrants have started to sell chi@@ ckens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local ones , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai native , who moved to the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has tasted the native of Papua - the m@@ um mo@@ m &#91; the women &#93; of Papua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indonesian President , Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i during his election campaign in 2014 promised ine@@ qualities and violations of law in Papua .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 parts of Papua ( including Pan@@ i@@ ai ) on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua New Zealand has changed little , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , expecting to fulfill our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s inauguration in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a bon@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers ki@@ cked off their tone and later returned with four soldiers , according to the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , ch@@ ased and struck the group with their rif@@ le @-@ col@@ ts , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so severely beaten that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set ali@@ ght and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young people from Papua , women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Centre to demand justice .
they carried cerem@@ onial arch@@ ways and carried the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance - running in circles and im@@ it@@ ating a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began to sling stones at police and military posts .
when the mood was heated up , the soldiers sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it is said in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the im@@ pending danger and called for peace and called on the crowd to return home .
nobody was listening in the mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his multi @-@ painted wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ ame still does not know who fired , but says that the bul@@ let came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was crowded , lots of shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , who was a witness to the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many In@@ don@@ esi@@ ans only bears a name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told repor@@ ters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua Police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ ei@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings took place only on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
for three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to tackle the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will not happen again in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Minister of Security Wi@@ ran@@ to said in October 2016 that he would initiate an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations .
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries have occurred long ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes to go through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on June 5 and said he had no plans to set up a complaint in Papua .
instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ ran@@ to , who accused the UN for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; claimed over 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence vote since 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been included in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with a fi@@ erc@@ er dis@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there has been no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus reiter@@ ated that the people of Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the bodies , the military looked for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the shooting has not stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Tuesday , the Indonesian police fired on villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a building company , who refused to bring an unconscious man into the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when fishing in a nearby river , died on his way to the hospital .
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) started shooting the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered , so the TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have hidden myself in my house for two days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called on the officers to be held ac@@ coun@@ table and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of the police from the territory . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a ho@@ ax for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the tribal members , Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua .
many joined the &quot; Free Papua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of Papua by con@@ ta@@ xing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ den Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people have been arrested and arbitr@@ arily arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in recent years , under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ content .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women , each of which can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
over the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native North and the new migrants , which have been in large numbers since the opening of new flight routes to the Nab@@ ire airport .
the few jobs that exist in the region tend to go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Papua has rarely invested capital or necessary skills to make their own businesses competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua .
beyond that , restrictions in reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although they gave them rare permission to film .
according to P@@ hel@@ in K@@ ine , the deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is election campaign to raise the restrictions of coverage in order to promote transparency and development were not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers to foreign journalists trying to report about Indonesia &apos;s un@@ peaceful provinces of Papua and Western pap@@ a : visa refusal and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of press review means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March , six Pacific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua ( including Pan@@ i@@ ai sho@@ ot@@ ings ) .
the same countries have historically been supported by the O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r rejected the group &apos;s alleg@@ ations and told journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4th , native people broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also attended the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has made another presidential election in 2019 , but it is unlikely that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ach@@ i again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the tribal council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants Jok@@ ow@@ i to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from being under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , are in poor educational and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their voice to Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the threats and in@@ timi@@ dations , the victims of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims made a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the corp@@ se of a victim was buried on a territory accurately against the police and the military station .
they know that perhaps justice will never come to them , but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with a lowered head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the world &apos;s highest residential towers in Dubai , forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 metre high , 79 @-@ floor building .
it is the second fire that in only two years swe@@ eps through the sky@@ scra@@ per , which is inci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the scre@@ aming of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; a villa@@ ger told his name as George ang@@ off , Reu@@ ters .
Dubai &apos;s civil defence authorities said that the fire fighting units against 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) extingu@@ ished the fire and cooled down the building .
the government said she was working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve issues related to the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of sky@@ scra@@ pers all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 showed that most of the damage came from the cl@@ adding , the exterior cl@@ adding for decoration or insulation .
in Britain the police said they believe that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding on the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which around 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : more Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through his large Davis Cup cou@@ p at the Annual General Meeting .
at a meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposition for this sport was to play a revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single only on two wins , thin@@ ly not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
these often very long , but also therefore highly valued five @-@ sentence classics remain preserved to the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 % of the member states voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only narrow@@ ly missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the overall reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical cont@@ ests , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one will continue to work on improving the applications .
after many in@@ consisten@@ cies , even before the vote , the proposal was made to fill the final in a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only comparatively minor details : in the following year the fin@@ alists of the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right in the following year in the following year .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements for training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to do less official media appointments in front of the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring For@@ bi@@ dden objects into the aircraft , find out a survey
a survey among flight passengers showed that more than 20 percent of deliber@@ ate or un@@ consciously forbidden objects were smu@@ g@@ gled to the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , who entered the aircraft while they accidentally bore forbidden knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they had been late discovered that they had er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously traveled with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet @-@ charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers rather dis@@ regard the rules .
of those surv@@ eyed admitted that they were know@@ ingly attempting to fly with something banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent millenni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , were members of Generation X .
the most common items that were deliberately inj@@ ected to T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent stated to have know@@ ingly carried items with blades by security screening , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es also confirmed that they had deliberately brought prohibited drugs to the plane .
the company said it was asking travellers around the country to find out how many in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently smu@@ g@@ gled up smu@@ g@@ gled goods through airport security and how many had done it intentionally .
it is no surprise that people who are most likely smu@@ g@@ gling - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through safety , those who fly most often .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which fluids should take them away or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the greatest amount of items conf@@ is@@ cated by the T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
for a while people thought T@@ SA could view books as smu@@ g@@ gled goods .
liquids are allowed on inland flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t care : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel Order
Elec@@ tro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to deal with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
he has hitherto under@@ estimated that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the increasingly triumph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la boss El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time revealed another , less da@@ zz@@ ling number when announ@@ cing the latest quarterly balance : the cancell@@ ations made in the new mass market model 3 .
over the past few months , Mus@@ k has often had more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery is just starting .
now Mus@@ k ad@@ mits : 6@@ 3,000 had been withdrawn from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 orders .
critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is merely non @-@ binding reservations .
in the event of a cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 USD and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment &quot; completely .
currently , 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations pre@@ tend that Mus@@ k cleaned up in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss doesn &apos;t believe that the cancellation of up to twelve percent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not on demand , but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 , all models will be taken together - 500@@ ,000 to one million by 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , there are 1800 bookings for this day per day .
if you order a Model 3 today , you can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new production lines , which have never been tested in practice , with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if there are too much delays , then the liability of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
for then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in dro@@ ves .
EPA boss P@@ ru@@ itt pul@@ ls back on the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
one day after being su@@ ed by 15 states Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Agency , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not mention the complaint which was raised against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about a deadline that expi@@ red on 1st October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for o@@ zone near to earth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay the compliance for one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interfer@@ ing with local decisions or hin@@ dering economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump Public Prosecutor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , was a reliable opponent of strict environmental protection regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly been forced to block or delay regulation to which the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels un@@ le@@ ash .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ ction regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ als in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority when he attempted to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , which committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane le@@ aks .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his turn @-@ over to o@@ zone standards is quite simply the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfilment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under earlier administr@@ ations , EPA has often failed to meet deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement to set the deadline for implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA for more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by trial , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and the authority it gives us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the opinion of the EPA said that P@@ ru@@ itt would some@@ day use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the provisions are based on solid policies and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive new version of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet voted in the Senate .
the New York general attorney Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of the states that had su@@ ed the EPA in this week , said the Group intends to maintain the legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g flowing into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this case , New York joined California , Connec@@ ti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , O@@ reg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ as , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil O@@ zone is created when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year .
representatives of public health care and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered about P@@ ru@@ itt &apos;s surprising exchange of courses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from those responsible for the protection of the air we breathe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to address environmental contam@@ in@@ ants and their special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius @-@ Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche , a ser@@ en@@ ade will be invited to the old cemetery grounds in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , 16th July , at 4.@@ 30@@ pm .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village made the friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ gens a matter of their concern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Walter Martini points out : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ary Chapel was first mentioned in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer Lloyd &apos;s book : &quot; Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church to Tum@@ lingen , including the &quot; Vo@@ g@@ bey &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the certificate according to the document on the Tum@@ linger Berg , apart from the former parish church , there was also a marvellous farm belonging to which the church or pat@@ ron@@ age was owned and not the other way around .
so there were also people there .
as from the description of the Freu@@ den@@ stadt district of 18@@ 58 , it was beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the centre of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; the third , the beautiful settlement centre of the village .
old maps from the period around 1600 under@@ line these historical facts .
the law of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from early medieval property law .
a gentle@@ man who built a church and filled it with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also bequ@@ e@@ ath this church .
in doing so , the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the greater of the two crushed on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell then rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released later during the Second World War in 1942 .
during the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) window pan@@ es were inserted and the bell parts were stolen .
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops camp@@ ed near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to fall in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Hil@@ arius cemetery was also used as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the church was demol@@ ished .
only the bell tower was standing .
in the New Year &apos;s Eve 18@@ 34 , a storm split the steep@@ le and half collap@@ sed .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demol@@ ished .
only the today still existing tower was preserved as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em are fo@@ stered by Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn as the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
as organis@@ er , the friends and promot@@ ers invite Tum@@ lin@@ gens to the sixth seren@@ ade to the old cemetery of St. Hil@@ ary Chapel on Sunday , July 16th , at the sixth seren@@ ade .
this is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler High School Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with speeches by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the final word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 3 : 30 PM .
for the end of the seren@@ ade , a drink @-@ drink takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organisers exhibit the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organizers hope to receive many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ de facility , which is of importance for tumours and audi@@ t@@ oriums .
the friends and tumours of Tum@@ lin@@ gens are particularly committed to their home care , such as the seren@@ ade organizer , Walter Martini , re@@ affir@@ med .
association wants to have permission of wind turbines to be examined
&quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends itself &quot; does not see any legal pre@@ condition for the construction and has therefore appe@@ aled to the district council .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim refuses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has asked Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw his authorisation for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was un@@ lawful .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen only at the city border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal a wind power concentration zone existed .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time , the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy utilisation for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones shall prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ ess &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind @-@ force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette a few days earlier , but the district government D@@ us@@ sel@@ dorf had not approved , because of a lack of form .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the granted approval status is still un@@ lawful and therefore also withdrawn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break , the city council once again decided to enter the wind conc@@ entri@@ c zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; the District government &apos;s approval is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is where the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the letters have been entered at the circle Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them on the occasion of re@@ viewing the matter again .
however , they do not expect the proceedings to be stopped .
with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the contents of the &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; association &apos;s argument in terms of content .
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning the construction of four turbines , each 200 metres high , on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
last year , the company , in which the City of Vier@@ sen is involved indirectly , had le@@ ased lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 @-@ hect@@ are site .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - roughly one @-@ fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ se@@ ater households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sen became the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind turbine plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor crash together : woman dies in terrible accident
one horrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning around 10 o &apos;clock on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ man@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was injured in the process .
two other persons were injured slightly .
the country road was closed for hours .
under police terms , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch , with her 53 year old mother , drove the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her 53 year old mother as accompanying person .
city and dealer plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and people from the region will re@@ discover shopping opportunities in the city centre in September . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trade association and the city administration want to take advantage of the weekend on September 8 and 9 in order to enti@@ ce residents to stroll through the city centre .
as the chairman of the trade association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend should sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers to what offers their own city provides apart from the usual supermarket goods .
there is , therefore , a market with regional providers , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , domestic companies should present themselves with their apprenticeship places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre will invite you to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mid@@ night shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the action aims not only on residents of the city and the region .
in preparation , advertising spots on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend , says Christian König .
city administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
this means that the trade association and the city go into another stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive city centre . &quot;
these include new offerings , such as the first &quot; Active Tag &quot; for the well @-@ appointed Sunday , talks with all the professionals and hosts to move them to active participation .
attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentials should be re @-@ opened or re @-@ opened .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but many locals also lost the inner city when shopping .
in the end , everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ving the city centre - to land@@ lords , businesses all over the city and clubs .
it was necessary to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that had spread to some extent , had said it in the spring .
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that the country &apos;s third &quot; homeland shopping &quot; tag took part in five Thür@@ inger cities for the first time .
besides Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should promote &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the appreciation of local trade and strengthen its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action led by the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct surroundings with his purchasing behaviour .

Tr@@ ump set out after le@@ aked calls from phone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tr@@ ump called on the Mexican president En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to stop publicly saying that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US president insul@@ ted him because he publicly den@@ ounced the wall . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project .
tran@@ scrip@@ tions of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull have also been published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the USA refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia was &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade , which was im@@ par@@ ted by the Obama administration , would let him look like a &quot; dump &quot; after he proposed a ban on the reloc@@ ation of refugees to the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump termin@@ ates the call after he said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford @-@ Mass@@ ac@@ re : activists perform rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as Call for Justice
a 1948 @-@ s Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with rif@@ les to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a pin@@ stri@@ pe suit - took a long train at his ci@@ gar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors the occup@@ ants were floating in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ams t@@ ore the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged by the passenger &apos;s seat .
fortunately , this horrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is only a reproduction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost all of the audience hit very real si@@ ghs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , citizens of Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to im@@ itate the night when two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were ra@@ ged by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever accused of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s really incredible that in all these years no one person was arrested - although we see them in our congregations , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in organizing the post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man of the State Georgia and a life @-@ long civil rights activ@@ ist .
it serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want the end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must obtain justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we obtain justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a for@@ en@@ sic doctor puts a cloth on the corp@@ se of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
according to F@@ BI files received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding ridges have been suspected of the ly@@ n@@ ching process .
but none has ever been indic@@ ted .
although the susp@@ ects have been on a free footh@@ old for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions around the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the black people in Georgia to vote for their vote for the first time in the summer .
approximately at the same time as the choice stab@@ bed a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - supposedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy , and that the baby she wore did not come from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid $ 600 to free Mal@@ com from prison , thus the F@@ BI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they approached the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an F@@ BI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removed evidence and covered the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks puts it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a suff@@ rage massac@@ res , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register , and if you vote , this will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for nearly a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has conducted the annual production of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
her presentation is illustr@@ ative , po@@ ign@@ ant , and is rooted in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , many of whom want to believe that he does not exist in America anymore .
it is difficult to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ ching , because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest Black - pushed into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene had a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ Director .
he has played the role of the chief @-@ clan member for years , but he said the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett h@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester reti@@ res and ur@@ ges him , fur@@ i@@ ously that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am win@@ king off my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona responds to the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all the black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still chu@@ ck@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think that white people at that time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yet , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black performers laugh@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you only have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is exactly where the energy shifts in space , a sense of compan@@ i@@ onship replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy trying to get this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says sharply and with im@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
there are cries , shots and then silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman clothed with sad@@ ness is about the corp@@ ses of the actors and performs Bil@@ lie Holidays &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mour@@ ners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen spectators wi@@ pes sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , arrived to see the performance , many just come down the street .
they spent almost eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive humidity , when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the bur@@ ial sites of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point the mur@@ ders have remained an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , if you stand on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels gh@@ ost@@ ly .
when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene loads the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead bodies .
children ho@@ ck at their heads , register the counter@@ f@@ eit blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they &apos;re not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ um@@ bles a little boy as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the ly@@ n@@ ch rope and wipe away their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who has played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ cona hu@@ gs two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks out with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you did it for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience sat together with the actors for dinner .
at a table a white pair from Atlanta is chat@@ ting about the reproduction with a black pair that they have just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski rush@@ ed to find words , which feeling the performance left behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... to come from people who look like you themselves and do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the ly@@ n@@ ching continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room Ty@@ rone feels Broo@@ ks &apos;s farm at his table , he eats and re@@ members the civil rights .
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; the emphasis is in some ways inspiring , because it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so if we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dä@@ mm@@ erung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans to Bay@@ reuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf places a colourful and fri@@ vol@@ ous st@@ aging in front of a gigantic six @-@ storey backdrop .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows optionally a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ in and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from East German times or the New York Stock Exchange .
in front of that , an open Mercedes classic car is par@@ ked in which the Rhine @-@ kill@@ ers pos@@ ing as a rock@@ flow , or alternatively an is@@ etta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stack@@ ed oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ motiv - money , power and gre@@ ed - which is attracted by its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; st@@ aging . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the three Rhine @-@ kill@@ ers - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise wonderfully with the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot;
K@@ ES@@ S seduc@@ es Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , cr@@ ush a corp@@ se into the trunk in Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ier and enter the Kra@@ wall@@ o @-@ cli@@ que .
Stephen Mill@@ ing sings the wonderfully nasty Ha@@ gen that surrounds the aura of a heavy weight box .
brutal the scene when he sw@@ ings Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) still needs to believe it .
the audience thanks it to the ensemble with a strong applause .
stor@@ my parties are Fo@@ ster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski who mo@@ dest@@ ly bows his hands to the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te .
there is great applause for the Fest@@ spiel@@ haus , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat in casual leisure wear .
the show was eag@@ erly awa@@ ited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 he had to make a sound of the pipe concert , five years later there were great rejo@@ icing in which the occasional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls went down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have rejo@@ iced over this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is noticeable that the audience with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has grown in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it has also grown to be an understanding of its perception .
I draw a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
Max quantity works as a volunteer
they work in their voluntary year at several locations .
where everywhere ?
lots : usually in a stone urt in the furniture fair , once a week , I am here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I also worked at school in an open day .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ appointed volunteer .
how does that come from ?
amount : I did a high school diploma .
and then a civil engineering course , let us say , successfully broken off .
I realized for myself that it is wrong for me and I want to do something different , working with people .
and then I asked myself what do you do .
make a social year , as there is an insight , you can see how it is on site , in the focal point perhaps too , really is .
and was it that way ?
amount : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social sector during the winter semester .
I will study dual , probably do a social worker training in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study in Ham@@ m at the university of applied sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different places during the volunteer service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends where you make your FS@@ J .
it can be done from anti@@ quity to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I was able to see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
in other words than in civil engineering ?
a lot : well , here it &apos;s not about counting stamps .
one always has other people up@@ side down , each of them has a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee , whether a youth who has been taken out of the family - you always have to respond to it individually .
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have reservations ?
quantity : for this I am not the type .
it is an area that gives a lot .
a lot of love , lots of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is that way .
Pear@@ son drops further 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revi@@ ve business
the British educational group Pear@@ son said on Friday that they will disman@@ tle further 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent , since another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure the company faces .
the job reduction , the CEO John Fall@@ on , mainly announced for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , is in addition to his previous restructuring , in which 4,000 positions have already been lost .
Pear@@ son announced in May in a third cost cutting program a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( USD 3@@ 94 million ) in order to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning .
the company , which last month sold its shar@@ ehol@@ ding to Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year remains unchanged , following an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kab@@ ul &apos;s con@@ voy : killed by NATO in suicide attack
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , officials said .
five soldiers and an interpreter have been injured in violation of NATO &apos;s statement .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died in the subur@@ b of Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h .
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
NATO &apos;s opinion is that the explosion on Thursday evening has happened when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was &quot; attacked &quot; by a &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device . &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital on the B@@ agra@@ m air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Tali@@ ban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agra@@ m .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian fat@@ alities in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Tali@@ ban said they had done this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack of the country , since the US @-@ led troops th@@ ron@@ ged the Tali@@ ban from power in 2001 .
the force under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ bers in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policies , and especially in the reputation of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani over the past few weeks .
EPA Ret@@ ur@@ ns Dec@@ ision to Del@@ a@@ ying the Smo@@ g Rule by Co@@ sts
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay regulation by the Obama administration , repe@@ ating that states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this occurred a day after 15 states su@@ ed the agency because of the step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive forward the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ zone provisions 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said they are showing the agency &apos;s commitment to work with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and by responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EP@@ O chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June the EPA &apos;s intention to stipul@@ ate the o@@ zone regulations - in which pollut@@ ant emissions are to be measured in a part of the country to determine where cuts have to be made to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with Colombia &apos;s bor@@ ough , filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to re@@ tract a broad range of environmental issues imposed by the former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that according to Tr@@ ump is to boost economic growth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ back of democr@@ ats and nature conservation groups that are worried about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA website says that inhal@@ ing air , which contains o@@ zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
community council wants community room
in the end , the decision was clear : with two counter@@ parts , the Municipal Council of Flu@@ e Win@@ es decides to establish a common area in the future retirement home .
before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing piece of land was signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it will still take time for the area to be owned by the church community until now , there is no planning obstacle for the project to be done by a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common area .
one of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the municipal council propose that such a common space is not to be seen as a meeting place only for the residents of the elderly , but openly into the congregation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stri@@ k@@ café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision made by the provision of funds for the ongoing household has already been decided last autumn by means of grants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is in the renovation area .
the establishment of a common room would be as reported as T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible .
the proposed resolution is to signal the investor that in this regard there is no bil@@ let between legs , the conclusion that both sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ers - what is le@@ aning against the surrounding environment - as well as a desk roof - which would reduce the lift height and make the construction more economical - would be possible .
need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer means this addition .
when it helps it : it happens in tune with the body .
it &apos;s not as easy as the common room .
Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many own buildings with which one does not go so well , but now they lean in the common room out of the window , she says : &quot; I do so badly with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is necessarily speaking for the common area - but absolutely against a community involvement .
it sees behind it a hidden subsi@@ dy to the already wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface there is no subsi@@ dy , but I get a genuine counter @-@ value that is market@@ able in case of doubt , is the counter @-@ speech .
Sta@@ ig@@ ner &apos;s request to adhere to the proposed amend@@ ment finds three pro@@ pon@@ ents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two counter@@ parts of the original program Stefan H@@ aller sums up : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we put the decision in this way , we make a giant leap to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with Car : cyclists are thrown on road
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured by a car in Gar@@ ath on Wednesday and severely injured .
as the police informed , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was travelling with his bike on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg from the direction of Hil@@ den .
the senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the street Am bushes .
a passenger car leader in the same direction granted him priority .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder was driving onto the road , he obviously did not pay attention to the on@@ coming traffic .
he joined a car with a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was transferred to a hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ ting carriage .
FC Bayern Munich to disp@@ ense with the Super@@ cup at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba must let the game play against Dortmund .
with personnel care , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund on the first mandatory game of the new season .
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , the German soccer record champion Bayern Munich is getting bigger and bigger .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to disp@@ ense with the BV@@ B also on David Al@@ aba .
this was confirmed by the Italian on Friday .
in addition , the min@@ ors Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six trial games , An@@ cel@@ otti has bl@@ amed the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not good at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official compulsory play of the season .
&quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who was expecting a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights draws the fans into their spell .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 people , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday .
hiking in the resin from star to star
the nation &apos;s first &quot; star path &quot; is to be created in the resin .
this is planned by the Astronom@@ ical observ@@ atory Saint Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet trail in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes to meet the needs of many visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform about stars and stars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ accessible installations in five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I ask St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber .
the information on the tables should be supplemented by Internet .
this is why a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of a location .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later the Star@@ path is to be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star path , viewers experience a lot of worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also learned why stars would have different colors or why a star is more lumin@@ ous than another , although it is far more distant .
you will also learn in which con@@ stellation is a selected star and when it is best to see .
the association has been operating the highest located observ@@ atory in Northern Germany since 2014 .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the heart of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
since 2003 , at the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen , there is something similar to the planned Star@@ light - the planet route .
starting in front of Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary path leads up to H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the dem@@ on degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf Planet - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a ball of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 meters away and measures 70 centimet@@ ers .
the total distance of the planet path is about four kilometres .
while the light from the sun to the Plu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
so pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fixed star would take half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing fight in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council Light@@ weight Champion , went down the corridor to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organization super @-@ suspension champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ vision world champion , Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you doing Champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photographs , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former fe@@ ather weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I grew up for Bron@@ er &#91; up to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m small for 140 .
I want to come down to light weight .
and it must move to lightweight weights &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
the fans demand that .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko was right .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
climate asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 pound debut this year to agree on a date with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) which also showed interest in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this battle could take place in Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode , because all the fans asked for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said and later squee@@ zed openly to fight on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he like Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday fight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko was very much praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think the tri@@ athlon Champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks &quot; very slow , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the co @-@ end . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact strength , then boxing .
they both said they could feel the momentum created for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the struggle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great battle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four injured after tire bur@@ sting
in the event of an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were severely injured on Thursday afternoon .
according to the first information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control of his vehicle shortly before the end of the market , just before the end of the market .
the car hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ came and then remained on the roof in the green strip .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was locked in the direction of the north for about an hour , then traffic on the left lane could be passed along the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; triple chain works better &quot;
after 2 : 2 at the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes that the optimisation of the defensive formation in Au@@ e points will bring points .
Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy with the first season game , with the result also if not the two opponents were against Br@@ uns@@ wick at 2 : 2 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we have to adapt even better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defense gam@@ bler from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the tr@@ ine chain is to be further optimized .
and a gate after a free offensive also don &apos;t want to capture the For@@ tun@@ as any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , it will be that no one stands apart from Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope better with the three @-@ chain preparation than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t yet know how to act in Austin , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have in the three chain on the half positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann , who can build well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we harmon@@ ise even better and we don &apos;t afford so many playing mistakes in the construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann will go to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can speak after a draw from a failed start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we have four points on Sunday and can focus on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a good season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer didn &apos;t want to know about this .
&quot; I only judged the start of the season after six to eight play days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be interrupted pre@@ mat@@ urely because of an accident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann that the players from Au@@ e might be a bit fres@@ her , since they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a ascension favourite . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know 100 percent where they are currently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Fort@@ una &apos;s inner defense . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true that the guests from the Rhin@@ eland serve as a light favourite on Sunday in the meeting at the finally ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we will swe@@ ep them away , just because we have the right to come under the first six , is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the second Bundes@@ liga which you have to beat right from the start , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says For@@ tun@@ as head coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; meeting such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot;
and so , Funk@@ el doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of Swedish asylum @-@ seekers review published
the recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , who have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authorities for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started the tests last year .
during the asylum procedure , they should make a more accurate assessment of the age after the Swedish Migration Service ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) was critici@@ zed for errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees who were minor .
until today , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 tests to test and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under 18 years old &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past few months , the figures are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was assessed as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
in May the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there were 4@@ 42 cases suggest@@ ing that the examined person was 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 results published it found that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly stated that she would be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , in which x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a skep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus from the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of humans to see if they used to go through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
judging the biological age in this way is very uns@@ af@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we can &apos;t say it , we shouldn &apos;t do that as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency advoc@@ ated the accuracy of the tests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of in@@ correctly app@@ rais@@ al a child as an adult is low . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
a seven @-@ ton@@ ne concrete section was installed on the bridge on the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s going great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , construction manager at the Department of Road Construction and Transport in the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the work began at the same time on all three need for rehabilitation , between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building end is planned for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule is adher@@ ed to .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a concrete arch bridge covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has arrived in the years .
in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabil@@ itated .
the other two bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now received a bridge cap of 1.@@ 30 metres wide and seven tons on Wednesday mor@@ nings on the north side .
this is a constra@@ int that is also used as an operating way .
a 2,@@ 20 metre wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday at the southern end of the bridge .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is to be walked .
the special thing about it is that it is finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
special finger@@ tip sensitivity has required the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable to which many companies are connected .
the local residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished at first .
for bridges between the building &apos;s building and the collecting branch in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light .
for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance , the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully blocked .
the costs for the three bridge structures amount to 700 000 Euro .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : under protest with German potato salad
it is not so common that parties move to a strand , but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) comes together , which is otherwise difficult to reconci@@ le .
the parties represented in the chal@@ k @-@ day volcan@@ ei@@ fel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , lef@@ ti@@ sts ) belong to a broad alliance that shows a peaceful flag on this day because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle in R@@ ond@@ ell invites to the &quot; big election campaign &quot; in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle .
and well @-@ known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ tier will be the top duo for the parliamentary elections on September 24 , and the deputy head of the Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k .
but those who are on the spot already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ lern but demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Ei@@ fel is colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally , the City @-@ Pic@@ nic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the well &apos;s forec@@ our@@ t , but now takes place in the parking place underneath the R@@ ond@@ ell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful picture that offers itself .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair@@ woman of the forum A world and one of the leading organisers , is really happy : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; original German potato salad that the Af@@ D can eat without any problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police have ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing a presence especially at the station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ D volcano Ei@@ fel has reported that he has tried to make such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had asked in Dau@@ n for the first time , but there was a cancellation because there were not enough parking spaces due to the built @-@ up Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; looking at the event at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does : around 20 o &apos;clock a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle , cares for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle various speakers , including the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D chairman Uwe lad .
there are about 200 people in the hall who are waiting for the top candidate to speak for the election of the Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k .
the police presence is unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening .
the Af@@ D @-@ Event takes a little more than an hour , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is time after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can cr@@ ush - no special incidents .
trumpet meets trumpet
a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ maker Tro@@ mb@@ uni@@ sts Freder@@ ic B@@ elli can be found in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ konz@@ erte morgen , Sunday , at 8 pm in the monastery church .
together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the slogan &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or just &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; hits a classical German formation with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have occupied solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov is Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter with the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire not only to transc@@ end the borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new look , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world music &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unites with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the jazz @-@ ech@@ op@@ ener N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical jazz and the free play combine to form a fascinating Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this cent@@ er@@ piece of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try it all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart openly about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s coming next ? &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship between Hollywood stars was that of her &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who finally dealt bitter@@ ly .
in spite of all this , the b@@ rün@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin ad@@ mits to the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with everyone I have seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I had played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after their separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed in du@@ alism .
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I just never liked being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z she suffered especially in school times when she preferred to dress like a bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girls , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public does not like to explain their love life : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself in front of the whole public . &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
the Democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thought ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I &apos;m a democratic governor . &quot;
the demonstration broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; as a coach , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump told a big announcement at the West Virginia R@@ ally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he owns coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , on Thursday evening , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued a statement in which it said : &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party that would prevent us from working to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the few legislative bodies in history , the announcement by Gover@@ nor Justice is just the last rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , engaging message , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the R@@ NC President Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be included in the sport again .
Russian athle@@ tics boss D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the athle@@ tics world championships that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who have been cut away from gold and silver med@@ als at competitions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found evidence of state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF president Co@@ e to the repor@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has realised in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re@@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think that progress has been made , but Congress supports the Task Force &apos;s recommendations that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the cor@@ rupted system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world championships , which begin on Friday in London , according to strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the leader of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia needs to meet some of the criteria for rein@@ statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still inadequate and banned Train@@ ers are still free , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told repor@@ ters in London after a lecture at IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
funeral for soldiers cut off in Mali
at a funeral service in Frit@@ z@@ lar in northern Hes@@ sian , around 1000 people of the two soldiers have thought of a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
to the still un@@ solved crash , Secretary of Defense Ursul@@ a von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but they described the two opposite pilots as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts of their profession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow to this highest sacrifice which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen died a week ago in Mali in West Africa .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom St. Peter .
at noon only the relatives in the church took leave .
after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens &apos;s prime minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
the grape @-@ branches laid down roses , the relatives were arms in arm on the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Defense of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Le@@ yen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described the in@@ verse soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sat@@ ch@@ ised . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the commander @-@ in @-@ chief had set up the flying operation of the helicopter mechan@@ ic in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regi@@ ment to which the soldiers belong , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this occupation could not turn the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali , Minister of the Le@@ yen , did not show that the deployment was dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country , of which we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik doesn &apos;t want a grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife after his death .
this shared the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in Ros@@ kil@@ de Dom@@ kirche .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision .
it is still unclear where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French home country .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would like to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 he retired and also called the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prince Char@@ ging &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not consider himself equal to his wife , even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish royal family .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years .
born in 1965 in London , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ bility , met Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1965 .
on the Th@@ ames he worked in the French embassy .
during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people were always flo@@ under@@ ing , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 @-@ year reign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik said about the first years in Denmark : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk @-@ so@@ cks instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ l@@ ises I smoked in place of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of society @-@ critical intellectu@@ als , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants quick re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony &apos;s prime minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the Land@@ tag , but he does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because on Friday the parliament voted for the dissolution of parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising withdrawal of a Green Party from its state parliament in Lower Saxony had pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
five months before the official date of the elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ voice majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the former Green MP El@@ ke T@@ westen founded her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for election 2018 in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover .
the CD@@ U group leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his group to include them .
thus CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in Lower Saxony &apos;s Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far , the ratio has been revers@@ ed .
the new day of the Land@@ tag will be voted on the 14th of January next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; red @-@ green state &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; government must now decide whether to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , however , considers it indispensable that the Land@@ tag as quickly resol@@ ves its self @-@ resolution as quickly as possible .
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the Land@@ tag will depri@@ ve the prime minister of confidence and elect a successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these opportunities must be examined legally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will discuss all questions in peace if they are legally tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something kur@@ i@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she described herself as a follow@@ er of black @-@ green .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens demanded the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ate parliam@@ ent@@ arians to rel@@ inqu@@ ish their state parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume , of course , that they return their Land@@ tag Archives , which they received via the green national list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president , Anja P@@ iel , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we greatly regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has deliberately decided not to speak any pron@@ unci@@ ation in the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot comprehend this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
s &amp; D candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transfer of the Lower Saxony Party parliam@@ ent@@ arians El@@ ke T@@ westen to CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Green Party members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters but also betra@@ yal of Red @-@ Green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the President of the Social Democrats on Facebook on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly elect the Land@@ tag .
the exit of T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in its past vanity and fru@@ stration puts its personal interests in front of the good of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised the SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Sal@@ vation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony is taking this dirty intri@@ gue and trying to make political capital out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dutch President Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to take El@@ ke T@@ westen into CD@@ U .
the Social Democratic Party leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , designed T@@ westen to fal@@ si@@ fy the outcome of the Parliament election in 2013 with personal career gifts .
the CD@@ U was in front of the SPD strongest force at that time , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority in the parliament .
Minister of Agriculture in Interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ si@@ es , Herr Schmidt ?
Germany is talking about contaminated eggs .
how could this sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , is in an interview with the editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) talking and answering .
Mr Schmidt , How can the consumer protect itself from pois@@ oned eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to watch the eggs in your fridge and check stamp print . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the Bundes@@ länder provide the latest information on the affected eggs @-@ bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
also , if , according to everything we currently know , a health hazard is practically excluded .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
in spite of this , my house is immediately switched on and since the announcement of Germany &apos;s sad@@ ness in close cooperation with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
as well as manufacturers , trade has to ensure that the products sold are market@@ able and harmless to health .
if the residual oil content of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not market@@ able .
un@@ loaded eggs can , however , be sold and consumed .
this time , not the factories are to blame .
do manufacturing companies and consumers sit in the same boat ?
according to the state of knowledge , the production plants do not meet any direct blame .
rather , they have to expect economic damage due to alleged illegal practices by service companies .
as always , there are too few controllers in the seri@@ ousness .
is it missing only on the staff or on the conclu@@ sive competence ?
it was precisely the official controls that have uncovered the process .
the truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded .
precisely this is why a consistent explanation of such events and the transfer to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in cases where crimes can be present are of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made it clear many times that I expect a complete enlightenment from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular al@@ arms necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers have the right to only get safe and market@@ able food .
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly prosec@@ uted .
the pan@@ de@@ mic means that manufacturers , distributors and consumers get into a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
in principle it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide in Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ supplying animals is not acceptable and must be terminated without delay .
this must be consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
I expect the competent authorities to inform the facts quickly and comprehen@@ sively .
how the Finance rules of football affect N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered spending on European football clubs will not interfere with N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of the UEF@@ A , as the guiding organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair @-@ Play rules launched by the UEF@@ A in 2011 mean that PS@@ G has to prove at some point that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to extract the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary which will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can certainly make the money loose for N@@ ey@@ mar to sign and transfer him to a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the funding of the team by the energy @-@ rich ruling family of Qatar .
clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players , but have to deal with legitimate income sources that allow them to even point the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken huge amounts of debt in their pursuit of success , effectively che@@ ated and ris@@ ked to ruin if banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P reloc@@ ated from the concentration on the debt of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model , which originally used Roman Abra@@ movi@@ ch in 2003 in Chelsea , bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder issue .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P publishing period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses amounting to EUR 30 million .
even though Plat@@ ini 2015 has fallen away from the Pres@@ i@@ dency of the Pres@@ i@@ dency , his successor , Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , continues to be deter@@ red by excessive expenses .
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will continue to strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the Buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing over the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract so that the selling price for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which later fell to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wi@@ t their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their income through companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a Catalan company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing exceeds the standard market rates , UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate revenues .
this is exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of sponsor@@ ing the P@@ SA was raised by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s PS@@ G payments could come to Qatar on payments from the World Cup 2022 World Cup .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 agreed that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s World Championship will be ambassador and such a manoeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could be easy to find out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to pay attention to any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UEF@@ A had no preliminary discussions with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , announ@@ cing on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they talked about the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G generated a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last financial year still have to be published .
PS@@ G anticip@@ ates that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s arrival is a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dising and jer@@ sey sales .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s move by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the La League , Ja@@ vier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state financed by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and this has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair@@ play because you can go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new shock supplier
in the past few years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has made on board chocolate for Swiss .
now the sweet collaboration is faced with a possible end : the airline will re @-@ write the order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott , on request of the news agency , confirmed a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nor@@ thwest Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products were checked every two to three years and subject to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokesperson .
around 17 million small red @-@ white @-@ wrapped up @-@ to @-@ 14 grams per year distribute the flight atten@@ d@@ ants before landing to the passengers .
the Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs .
industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders in accordance with &quot; Nor@@ thwest Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a chocolate manufacturer .
the Swiss doesn &apos;t want to betra@@ y how many applicants are in the new call for ten@@ ders .
but only Swiss manufacturers are in question .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the Treaty on Spring 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a comment .
since 2006 , the Swiss has been distributing chocolate tablets on board their flights .
prior to signing a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has delivered the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hu@@ g .
Swiss made the possibility to place the logo two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works together with different Swiss cho@@ col@@ ates manufacturers .
on long @-@ haul flights customers are p@@ am@@ pered First Class with goo@@ dies from the conf@@ is@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class the passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i von Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
also on the short circuit Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i is distributed by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in Business and Economy Class .

nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of the story is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &apos;s , for the 90 @-@ years Gr@@ unge era ( when the thin@@ ker David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter turned the Sk@@ etch @-@ comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for itself - that is , for 2001 before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to greater things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels as if time was scar@@ ce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worked surprisingly well , not just because of its absurd hum@@ ors ( it contained an original story for a talking tin of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by getting to the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play hor@@ ny children who will grow - they nevertheless managed to win back the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more according to the casting principle , among them a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 &apos;s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at one point , a character cle@@ ars through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of other things from 1991 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the lovely C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has never forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Mar@@ ino ) still hasn &apos;t lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there &apos;s another crazy evil plot included in the Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ done impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it is a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , showing Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s sub@@ li@@ pp@@ age of &quot; sing@@ les , &quot; his former big man @-@ on @-@ camp Andy is now feeling like an old cra@@ cker .
these are the moments of random del@@ u@@ sions that could heat this fran@@ chise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until it reaches what I consider as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose final scene will show the band the movie premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon reminds us of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its East @-@ West ring combat icon@@ ography .
the comedy with Rh@@ ys Thomas , created by Brian Gat@@ ev@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Greg@@ or and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alo@@ gues are synchron@@ ised by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it &apos;s a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police sp@@ ends time looking at chess on television , as Americans may do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ Ã e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de the voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ ag@@ an mask is involved - that it often plays like a single .
there are six long episodes , and the comedy is not fast or often enough .
&quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; which was edited on a lower length , could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , as Greg@@ or and I@@ os@@ ef repeatedly visit the American Embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a he@@ ap of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the imagined communist public is that Western culture can do everything for a feast .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and with theirs .
attack on Dru@@ gs Ma@@ fia in the Land
the police have succeeded in hitting the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Con@@ stance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart .
15 accused were arrested between 25 years and 77 years of age and had already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
officials also ensured larger quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , and several hundred thousand euros .
in the case of the same ra@@ ids in Italy , two persons were arrested .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects of Italy .
the two are probably shipped to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
over 300 polic@@ emen were in action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ma@@ fia &apos;s members are accused of organised drug crimes , severe violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in Kon@@ stanz has been investigating the organised drug trade in Southern Germany since summer 2016 .
between the attor@@ neys in Con@@ stance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had nearly daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , on Wednesday morning , the large @-@ scale deployment was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
the investigations were targeted primarily by Italian citizens with a close relation to the Italian ma@@ fia .
also an incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account .
way compla@@ ins big gaps in the foreig@@ ner register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreig@@ ner register in Germany shows substantial short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the Commissioner for the Refu@@ gee Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to a large number of gaps in the immigration center register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; partly grave error decisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to figures , ten million people with foreign nationality are reported in the register , including 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore managed by approximately 600 immigration authorities in Germany .
because the data had not been sufficiently well maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data was found in 1921 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of people who have long been no longer alive , or citizens who are German citizens and should not actually appear in the Register anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data input can significantly slow down return processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; continues the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in statistics of sufficient people , EU citizens are also included , who do not have to leave . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such false decre@@ es led to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a distorted debate on how to deal with tax@@ pa@@ yers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the German government has apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children if they have arrived from there .
this emerges from an internal paper issued by the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the paper , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BA@@ MF is implementing such procedures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children , with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was virtually no longer possible , according to the newspaper , referring to the difficult situation on the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement it is responsible for refugees from the EU state , which they reach first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a migrant is travelling to another EU country , this state can send it back to the country of entry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the office now states : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has increased considerably . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has given guarantees for the inclusion and accommodation of families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ rt@@ HR ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back to the Dublin Agreement .
the domestic spokes@@ woman on the left @-@ wing group in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten un@@ lawful record conditions and a threat to child welfare because of the lack of the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach provided the blood don@@ or service for other people .
at least by the twelve citizens who were awarded the Friday .
above all Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who , with his meanwhile 100 donations , shared 50 litres of blood .
traditionally , in the meeting of the Municipal Council , the congregation acknow@@ le@@ dges the multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s ingeni@@ ous how our body is designed for it and we pay tribute to the don@@ ors who make their blood available to strangers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the Regional Head of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher as the cann@@ ed are broken into their constitu@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , corn producers reported about the actions carried out in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach in the spring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chief of the DR@@ K . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the change to the theatre house has led to higher number of participants a few years ago .
before that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ rels were among the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 contributions each .
half as many are booked by Herbert M@@ air and Dor@@ o@@ thee Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter gave each 500 milli@@ liter of their life juice .
the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged , after weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulations over a rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensified pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates up to 0.@@ 25 % , with less members reaching an increase this month , as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase .
in its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 at 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on household income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the fall .
but it indicated that in the next few years interest increases would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation induced by the Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that the costs of bor@@ rowing would have to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mut stimulus package issued a year ago after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks as of the coming February , although it has been said that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds in the framework of this system - at 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , since pressure on the real income of households will continue to burden consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at interest rates it repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain tightening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be required to cool inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat larger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scale than markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another one in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be progres@@ sively &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts for this year and next year will be 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the forecast predicted in May .
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell on this news against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and dropped by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened rising expectations on interest rate and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % has risen to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to reach 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will easily recover after the end of the year .
the recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households , which are affected by rising inflation and minor increases in wages , as the tightening of inflation is getting worse before it becomes better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that in the coming years monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent income from income &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages will recover &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significantly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecasts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also boo@@ sted by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak Po@@ und , which will compensate for a portion of lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the fall of the plague .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
prior to the Bank &apos;s last verdict on interest rates , the call for interest rates rose as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressur@@ ised households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers asking for an increase to 0.5 % in July .
inflation decreased from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said this was expected and will attract it again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said the exceeding in proportion to its target of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; entirely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak Po@@ und . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director of Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the recent return of swap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , since len@@ ders are looking for shops and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals are running out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages finish , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trans@@ form@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment in September following a fight against the High Court against the financing of the drug in the N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ sex pre@@ posi@@ tional pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which may reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now being delivered by the Health Service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appe@@ als confirmed last year a judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice according to which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p in spite of the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England boss Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive moment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to enable the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced to the UK in April 2018 .
pre@@ pro@@ posi@@ tional pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV medicines taken prior to sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in infection risk .
pre@@ p prior to intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics , suitable participants will be identified who agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gender and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people living in England and registered with a family doctor may also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week after an international competitive sourcing .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence how it is used , taken and implemented on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said St@@ ev@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should supplement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in tac@@ kling one of the greatest health challenges of mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive Officer at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pre@@ p , if targeted at needy and vulnerable people , offers the possibility to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September on people with high HIV @-@ risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority now has to be that the study will be conducted quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine was obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , Minister of Health , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delays and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how trans@@ form@@ ative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV and that they will contribute to the eradic@@ ation of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , declined in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to an Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; Jo@@ anne says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I looked for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot of the apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to enter the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi of Not@@ ting Hill to use 12@@ ,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the requirement .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not only about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement made it possible for Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper lighting window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to let it work for a longer time .
in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all seating and j@@ ars made by Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchen is nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering art went into it , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s important , so that when you push the door , it gli@@ des very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage , Jo@@ anne could gain an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to increase the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself by a good design and increased square meter of some standard to something quite amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them .
brothers fighting for a $ 500 million real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty in a dispute over one of Vict@@ ori@@ as &apos;s largest real estate empire worth over 500 million dollars .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton football club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp conflict on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family bought a shop at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood in 1973 .
there the family founded West@@ co jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for $ 85 million in 1999 .
this money has been invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the city center , Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to &apos;s development areas , the Gold Coast apartments and Mt Bul@@ ler and shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her de@@ ceased father , Col@@ in - Paul was described as the &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about a third .
a court record states that this means that Col@@ in owns property worth $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul worth $ 17@@ 6 million .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first affir@@ m@@ ative in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed negotiations .
the brothers now also struggle to control the existing business - which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but th@@ rows Paul to in@@ compet@@ ently manage some possessions .
in an early case submitted by Col@@ in he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage prescri@@ bes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs rise in the event , with hundreds of pages with affir@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and from both parties law firms .
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her de@@ ceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delic@@ at@@ essen shops from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first je@@ an shop of the family .
Col@@ in says that he started West@@ co there when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property on to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De Lu@@ tis Group , with Col@@ in claiming that Mark was paid 10 million dollars and $ 26 million when leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conditions of their financial division have become bitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in with@@ held himself very much , although he was a former AF@@ L member and after a biography of 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in responded by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case was before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul chose to su@@ e me and to pass our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , adding that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our business will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the President &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including the news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course .
here is a piece of repor@@ ter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with executive employees on his first day of work , he posed a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s White House , which he wanted to repair : poor information coming into the president &apos;s hands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kell@@ ys &apos;s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by supervis@@ ing its media diet .
President Tr@@ ump &apos;s relationship with television goes back decades , and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if candidate Tr@@ ump was angry with unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were too impressive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former campaign advis@@ er Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February to Politi@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the time , Politi@@ co Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keeping s@@ ling@@ backs on Twitter habit , according to six ex @-@ election officials , is to ensure that personal media consumption includes a steady stream of praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that tr@@ umps t@@ witter habit ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe these campaign officials know what we don &apos;t know about others - that Tr@@ umps T@@ we@@ ets would have included even more combus@@ tible material without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump did not send .
if his employees managed it a few times to keep anger away from him , then their efforts paid off .
but no one has consistently prevented Tr@@ ump to cause controversy .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try again to present their own agenda by presenting tr@@ ump material that may promote their views of the world .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - devoted entirely to this story - reported in May about the pre@@ dile@@ ction of advis@@ ers to provide du@@ bi@@ ous information to the president for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ smith :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and to find out where they originate from .
exactly this happened at the end of February when someone mal@@ evol@@ ently accused the President of a printed copy of an article by Got@@ news@@ .com , the web site of Internet provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson is permanently ban@@ ished from Twitter because of ch@@ ic@@ ane , or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that in the past he has utter@@ ed false accus@@ ations and re@@ vo@@ ke it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gold@@ smith added that the then Chief of Staff , Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and General Secretary of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the paper@@ work that receives the Tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors are still striving for influence .
these un@@ changeable factors make Kell@@ ys &apos;s mission very difficult .
most wanted criminals to get mail from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped .
the police all over Europe send mail to dangerous criminals during this summer ( virtual ) postcards .
since the addresses of the severely sought @-@ after severely criminals are not well @-@ known , critics of the population will be raised and asked .
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday the action that followed the winter &apos;s &quot; Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; Advent calendar .
the experiences would have shown that many fu@@ gi@@ tives were hiding at holiday destinations , it was said by Euro@@ pol .
twenty @-@ one postcards for sought @-@ after criminals from 21 EU countries have been put together .
since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wi@@ gs has been viewed more than 2.5 million times .
36 of the online @-@ nights could be arrested so far , at least eleven of them based on references to the publication on the website .
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire &apos;s Series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are again with some resol@@ ute travellers on the bar@@ ef@@ oot , who negotiated a tren@@ ch drawn by the municipality to rec@@ la@@ im a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside of a prosper@@ ous road from Soli@@ hull , called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire series &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch dug by the Council in order to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and pushed its vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have har@@ assed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they moved there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced into action by shame on its implementation , since it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travelers were there in May , were moved on and are back now .
more arrived last night , probably even more today . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long instruction to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue paying my community tax if the Council can &apos;t even stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a resident , who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; it is ridi@@ culous , we have just seen the last round of these travellers , only to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the figures have increased this time and you even have seen a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for Soli@@ hull said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and cooperate with the Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls police . we take the necessary legal steps to move them forward as soon as possible .
in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create an image of the situation in which the Court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof on April 13 , 2014 , approximately 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and also revenue from the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of the dramatic increase in numbers of refugees arriving in the county , the hotel building was offered to the district office as a collective accommodation , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the housing of asylum seekers through the establishment of a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the municipal council .
but above all Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ l &apos;s senior mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location , and at that time already spoke of serious interested parties in the house .
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els with Managing Director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , purchased the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you will find Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof has been building sh@@ utt@@ les in front of the entrance for some time and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renovation works are carried out .
the floors have been torn out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath tu@@ bs are removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to do by March .
&quot; it &apos;s actually a nice place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows will be installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should later become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beautifully bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and meeting room belong to the equipment .
one would not want to position themselves at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale downtown level , Sch@@ erer ob@@ serves .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms , wants to spread wide , explains Sch@@ erer .
both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people should feel at ease in the hotel .
he has already conducted talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Director of Tourism Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer .
the city &apos;s ideas are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
looking at the level of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to define exactly .
just under one million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the external systems are also brought to the front man , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , a large terrace is created which will be accessible from the restaurant that is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : U.S. Special Represent@@ ative An@@ no@@ un@@ ces Grand Jury
in the Russia affair surrounding U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump , special investig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the panel resum@@ ed its work in recent weeks , writing the Wall Street Journal , calling on people familiar with the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the newspaper saw the move as a sign that Mu@@ eller extended and intensified his investigations .
the CN@@ N broad@@ caster reported that there were already initial charges of the Gre@@ mo@@ an in connection with a meeting between the oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
us secret services have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin since a long time , pur@@ pos@@ efully interfer@@ ed with in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were agreements between the b@@ umps campaign team and Moscow .
the investigations will focus on several men who acted as advis@@ ors to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the election campaign .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller was also taking a closer look at his private and business environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; written a few weeks ago that the special agent Tr@@ ump has personally moved into the centre and under@@ scored the alleg@@ ation whether the President might have hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main task of Grand Jury is to examine the present evidence in possible crime cases and to decide whether charges should be filed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Grand Jury is therefore also referred to as a bill of indictment .
most of the time , they are turned on when they are larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office to invite people to the criminal enterprise under oath .
according to the CN@@ N , invitations have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement , it was stated in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner &apos;s couns@@ ell@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his former Elec@@ toral Candi@@ date Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were also talking to them .
legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the setting show that Mu@@ eller would not be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that if necessary , he wanted to act quickly .
but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on in the end to decide on the charging of an indictment .
however , the setting up of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of new revelations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the theme gives the Democrats a way to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in a statement that he did not know anything about the establishment of a Grand Jury .
but she usually works in secret , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House appro@@ ves any measures that spe@@ eded up the work of the special agent in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former F@@ BI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that it would not be established against the President .
I have no reason to assume that something has changed , it was said in the explanation .
Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this ro@@ oting , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump had become loud , he tried to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to set up the investigations against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
following the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special issu@@ er and its employees .
this caused speculation about the release of Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller .
unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair surrounding the later @-@ assigned president , Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired on dra@@ ins by the President of the Ministry of Justice .
however , several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators presented bills of legislation on Thursday , after which the special agent could no longer be dismissed as easily . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : giant ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Antar@@ cti@@ ca
in the western Antar@@ ctic a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg has loos@@ ened from the scar@@ ce size of Berlin from the ice shelf .
this was announced by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the col@@ os@@ sus of about 1 tri@@ l@@ lion and 5@@ 800 square kilometres is now driving north and will probably need two or three years until it is melted .
with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants , which researchers have registered over the past three decades .
there is no danger for man from him .
according to research information , the extent to which climate change has played a role in the abor@@ tion of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear .
but overall there has been a series of unusual collap@@ ses in the region for about 30 years , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fac@@ tual background .
according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming .
the broken col@@ os@@ sus has so far been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ven .
ice shelf flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
it therefore continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ven is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
to the north of this ice shelf the balance of wa@@ xing and breaking was disturbed several years ago .
a complete ice shelf is broken down there , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is quite a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C ice shelf is in danger , as the front edge has never been pulled back as far as it is currently .
in addition , the ice plate is under tension and can dis@@ integrate if a piece breaks off at a key point .
melting glaci@@ ers and ice bergs does not increase sea level , as they float on the water and ice cream as much water as it results after melting itself .
however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase sea level , but only to a lesser extent , writes the British research project on the observation of Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI data , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C ice shelf is the fourth @-@ largest ice shelf in Antar@@ cti@@ ca with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean approximately 200 meters .
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural occurrence and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice plate now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the wi@@ dest withdrawal from the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists argued whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C ice shelf will grow back or fall back in the long run and possibly fall together , &quot; said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man , and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even if these researchers did not lead the demo@@ lition of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , however , many of the ice @-@ stu@@ ds of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart during the last decades .
this long skirt of the Antar@@ ctic stretches in the direction of South America .
according to the research program of the British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice area of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the increase in temperature has contributed to the decrease .
over the past 50 years , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has been heated by some three degrees and is now counting on the areas where the temperature is the fastest .
CD@@ U wants a house @-@ tari@@ ff at the staff
because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vac@@ ant jobs , the CD@@ U calls on the employers &apos; association to come out of the employers &apos; association to become more attractive .
just before the summer break , the circle day broke through 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 cler@@ ks and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
there are now 17 apprenti@@ ces who have had their first day of work behind them .
the courses in the circle are obviously much sought after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were listed for the places to be awarded this year .
nevertheless , the circle continues to provide personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
at present there are still 50 un@@ occupied places in the M@@ ett@@ mann district .
among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as the forces of general administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wishes of the parties , the administration should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is not only to cover short @-@ term needs for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented competition shortage .
the overall concept should ori@@ ent internally and externally , show concrete measures for lateral entran@@ ts and include a training campaign , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems that one didn &apos;t know before .
other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a high number of employees who leave the service for disease or age reasons .
so high time for action so that there are not even more places left un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the joint application with his party .
he had long been in the circle for a big surprise when he publicly challenged the personnel expenses and ba@@ ff@@ led the other parties .
people want all opportunities to be reviewed , which allow an exit from the municipal employers &apos; association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we don &apos;t come to a satisfying solution here at short notice , the district administration should seek a door@@ step , perhaps in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the CD@@ U tries to pay better the employees and officials than the public service charges .
sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level oriented to professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years .
only a few weeks ago new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Act .
not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Coun@@ cill@@ or Thomas Hen@@ del@@ e and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy har@@ dens the tone of NGO Mig@@ rants Res@@ cue Bo@@ ots
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs who are using lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they must not continue this unless they abide by new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of Interior , Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis War@@ ning came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat of the German relief organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their team had effectively co@@ operated with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to express a detailed alleg@@ ation of the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , saving human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we can &apos;t operate in the search and rescue area at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organisation in an opinion on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge all accus@@ ations raised at this time after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is assumed that its crew takes din@@ gh@@ y migrants aboard , which are delivered to them directly by traffi@@ ckers , and that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart so that ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the file of the prosec@@ utor , whose content was published by Italian media .
the crew is suspected of expos@@ ing themselves to the authority of the Italian Co@@ ast@@ guard who monitors rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the code of conduct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have agreed to keep the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not bring any &quot; significant changes or obstruc@@ tions &quot; of their rescue operations .
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organization is Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , Minn@@ iti has said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures had declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe .
climbs and Tri@@ als
nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim , the North Pal@@ at@@ inate , to enjoy tri@@ als and si@@ ght@@ se@@ ein@@ gs for four days .
three friendly guides were available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the castle and wine festival of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour conducted at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
observation points followed , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream plains .
in between there were again and again longer climbs , for the long tri@@ vi@@ als .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the sal@@ ine and the folk festival saus@@ age market .
once again , a look@@ out point on the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flow@@ n &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
on the last two days a lot of altitude difference was announced .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and shel@@ ters brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed sal@@ ine br@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ ation .
also Neu@@ stadt was ste@@ ered .
after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group met the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald from its best side - spor@@ tive and cul@@ turally .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga matches for e @-@ sport
are the sports stars sitting in front of computer consoles in the future instead of swe@@ ating through the stadium in the wind and weather ?
fact : e @-@ sport has long become a serious business , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans , and huge guaranteed tour@@ neys .
the first federal li@@ ga@@ des have also recognized this , which are becoming increasingly involved in this area .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed by the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and recently the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sports division in mid @-@ July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire new young audiences for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Managing Director Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there are a number of clubs on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; next weekend the FIFA World Cup in London organized the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified for example .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the Ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advises on an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football has to deal with 14 @-@ 30 @-@ year @-@ olds in particular that young people will still go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones .
with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under contract you could be more often present on these markets online much more than once a year to send the Bundes@@ liga to Asia .
what is this all about ?
during the E @-@ Sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the FIFA World Cup simulation are fought at competitive level .
as in normal sports , le@@ agues have long since established themselves in which the pros compete against each other .
and for the Asian Games , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official programme .
but is it really a kind of sport ?
for many , the performance is certainly getting used to getting used to it .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ber has also talked about the question for a long time .
for the professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical responses that can also be found in classical sports such as elevated heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
it also requires cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction to reaction .
professional gam@@ ers should train and pay attention not only to the console but also to their body .
&quot; the custom player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ rob@@ ber also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult to perform at online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing .
the scientists positively emphas@@ ise the high integr@@ ative impact of e @-@ sport .
players are on the international road , which is like a big global family , there are no intercultural obstacles .
a study by Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth for e @-@ sport .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and large tournaments .
sales are expected to rise to 130 million in three years .
this is little against the almost 2.4 billion euro of the Bundes@@ liga .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , e @-@ sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte Ad@@ vis@@ ers write . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many countries are already on the international level .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez take part in the U.S. Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ sports bet@@ ting company Uni@@ kr@@ n .
a lot of things are happening in Europe too .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a teaching subject , &quot; says F@@ rob@@ ber .
according to D@@ utt , the soccer premi@@ er league clubs in the Netherlands and France are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sports department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in comparison with Europe , Germany lag@@ ged behind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ Bureau R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to fall into nostal@@ gia and to glori@@ fy the old times is no longer enough today .
it is about preserving the tradition of the association , but at the same time alig@@ ning the company with the modern market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digital@@ ised world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t stick to the fact that everything stays the same with football as it always was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Car@@ ter con@@ vic@@ ted because of the lyrics Con@@ rad Roy push@@ es for suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls to commit suicide .
Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been suspended on par@@ ole .
Car@@ ter was con@@ vic@@ ted in June because of neg@@ ligent hom@@ icide by Con@@ rad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy on Thursday said at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain vac@@ ant until the appointment .
she had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both her and Mr Roy had suffered from mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood there with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and downward pointing eyes when she was con@@ vic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has shown no repentance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer stated that it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance which they completely depl@@ ore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Ju@@ dge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a public prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no day when I do not regret the loss of my beloved son . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I want him to be proud of me and how I handle everything . I try to be there for his sisters , in spite of all my pain that we will bear for eternity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , testified that she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the knowledge that she would never be part of her brother &apos;s wedding or would be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer have this single person with whom I have been together since my birth every day , is a pain I will always keep with myself for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to challenge another to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon mon@@ oxide intoxic@@ ation found in a vehicle .
the case attracted national attention after Car@@ ter &apos;s text communications reveal that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang on , jump from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family .
in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said Car@@ ter &apos;s attention was sought by Roy &apos;s death and ordered that it should benefit from any press .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
one of the few who defended Car@@ ter belonged to Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was con@@ vic@@ ted in 2007 for murder by her British room@@ mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ i : learning from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m of FC Bayern
it is not by chance that Joshua Kim@@ i was allowed to run on the Audi Cup as a captain .
the FC Bayern di@@ gests a big season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - an extra motivation does not harm .
something was different in his place in the cabin , that Joshua Kim@@ i saw right away , even if the additional piece of clothing was very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m and also no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he took the bind split by him to the arm .
&quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; the Con@@ fed Cup winner , after his first deployment as Bavaria captain .
good , the setting could have run better than at 0 : 2 versus the SS@@ C Naples .
but Kim@@ i was able to interpret the sign of the coach as well .
not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal had been chosen as a game guide from youth players , de@@ but@@ ant and just out of the holiday , but he .
sugar is best distributed to those who have a lot to do with good spirits .
so those who were chosen to do the heritage of L@@ ah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
Kim@@ i confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old te@@ amed up as a Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m over the field .
to the right rear , that is his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did the rest .
and at all Kim@@ i was working in this initial formation like the one who can best take the helm .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the in@@ filtr@@ ated troops .
he had the view of the whole while many others were busy with himself .
Vi@@ dal manages to over@@ play his missing fitness ( fol@@ d@@ les hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches pointed out that the devil comes out of the services of the Asia @-@ trip ( also only partly ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le do not neg@@ lect their first appearance in the Bayern tri@@ cot .
after all , that worked out quite well .
Sü@@ le ran alongside Kim@@ mir , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both acted with confidence .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli @-@ storm often did difficult , and Sü@@ le tried a few times successfully in the game @-@ building .
his colleague Ru@@ dy ad@@ mitt@@ edly admitted that the result was &quot; not as we hoped for . &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance during the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game shift , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as usual this Bayern world is still for the newcom@@ ers , one saw in connection to the game .
Ru@@ dy , for example , did not have one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but six or seven interviews .
k@@ im@@ me said good@@ bye to his new fellow players on the back of his new fellow players .
there he heard from Sü@@ ver an interesting sentence : &quot; what &apos;s going on here , I have already noticed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win any game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least he does not have to teach the new .
Al@@ aba motiv@@ ates Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
Austria &apos;s best known foot@@ b@@ aller has reported about Twitter shortly before the game and wished the Ö@@ F@@ B ladies all the best .
the Bavaria @-@ Legi@@ on@@ ary is quasi club @-@ mate of Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ Kapit@@ än@@ in Schn@@ ader@@ beck and fe@@ ver@@ ishly with our ladies .
the twe@@ et of the Austrian football player of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivation .
perhaps our ladies might need the famous Bayern @-@ D@@ us@@ el well .
company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises Di@@ agon@@ sing Tempo
it was often unfor@@ giving , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is reflected after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chambers and companies in the region speak on T V demand from a shift in economic policy - and simultaneously blame the old ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Trier Companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; knowledge attacks the desires of the economy that has blocked Lem@@ ke all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ us sees the biggest down@@ turn in infrastructure policy : the gap between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the priority list of the country .
this year the ministry hopes for a planning process , until 2021 the building law is set to rise .
the West Bank of Trier plays a role in the plans of the country , which stands in the urgent need of the Federal Tourist Board .
the goal is to take the route into operation in December 2020 , says Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees this as a sign to support regional , but internationally competitive companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier is striving for a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ Label , as suggested by Wis@@ sing , to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports , which has been sag@@ ging for ten years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing pra@@ ises an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Chamber of Commerce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees in the new master bonus an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro is fores@@ een for the passed master exam and 2500 euros if graduates learn to work independently within ten years of the master &apos;s training .
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
in the planned road construction , facts are to be created quickly , at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel , says Jan Glock@@ auer , head of the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce of Trier .
up to now , only 29 vac@@ ancies are occupied by 56 new engineers who wish to hire Wis@@ sing in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mobility .
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more jobs to be awarded to external offices .
the CD@@ U Group vice @-@ president Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to calculations by the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country is investing more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of state roads by 2017 and 2018 .
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
sober@@ ing is also the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had only rated power supply in an I@@ HK survey with a score of 3.4 .
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant internet connections and break@@ through@@ s .
ex @-@ Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , on the other hand , is currently out of politics and still sits on the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become the president of a private university in Karlsruhe , where after four months of dis@@ agreement , she already cleared the field .
Audi is expected to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face an opposite reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software to more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW CEO said the company believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and thus referred to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - prohi@@ bit or limit diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that three million Mercedes vehicles will be modified in Europe in order to reduce their diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des which em@@ it diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the costs for autom@@ akers to install systems for the neutr@@ alization of exhaust gases em@@ itted by diesel vehicles also increase , making it difficult to maintain the price of the cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of plot@@ ting the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes made by Volkswagen which could regulate the use of so @-@ called off @-@ age equipment that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car has been tested , but with normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were charged , while others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former Head of Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to deal with the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States was expanded .
the involvement of Audi in the investigation could heavily pol@@ lu@@ te Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer dispro@@ portion@@ ately contributes to the win of Volkswagen .
this message has the raft on Saturday at Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft travelled through Munich on Saturday , which has a special message .
if you pass the Is@@ ar on Saturday , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and this is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the construction department wants to clear up .
on the raft you can see a large information compartment .
it shows a rub@@ b@@ ish mountain .
the start of an publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; understanding for the Is@@ ar is meant to be a worthy ven@@ ison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer flo@@ wering over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and actions to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behaviour .
dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ asen and the laugh about the suffering
at times , Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed cartoon characters , the no@@ bl@@ ings of his characters are his trademarks .
also with 85 the Argent@@ ine@@ an hon@@ ors and works on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ ill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist he was among other things a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for greeting cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he once said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , he made his breakthrough at the end of the 1960s : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artist of cities was inspired .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures ca@@ vor@@ t in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own information , he still sits at the drawing table today , working almost ten hours a day .
over cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and clo@@ cks , his dro@@ ll figures continue to spread throughout the world .
for six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his figures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the main person in the movie &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - the most popular animal in his drawings - which has a jack of thousands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which is supposed to come to the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
that &apos;s why he relies more on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without a word .
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence threatened by climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is due to the drought toler@@ ating conditions and insect @-@ transmitting insects , leading scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , causing great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute C@@ RI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is at risk because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change over the past few years , which has brought much less rain in spring and much more in autumn .
this has effects on the life of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is also a small zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its the d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ das , and in very dry weather , there are many of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there is a lot on the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil attracts not only holi@@ day@@ makers , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened .
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought .
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thur@@ in@@ gian town of R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1200 anniversary .
the peak of the festival is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the Week@@ ly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels more secure : they are supposed to take their children to the office , which in 2009 were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades , or leave them home .
security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies .
they ask the repor@@ ters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed , percep@@ tions and gut feelings are enough .
there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of being on the pay@@ roll of government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest from violence , and while the bodies are accum@@ ulating throughout the country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to res@@ ig@@ ned in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year .
among the latter is her editor and her inspir@@ er of Ri@@ o@@ dol@@ ce , co @-@ founder of Ja@@ vier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books about violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep , although his presence is present everywhere - a great photo of Val@@ dez showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ o@@ dol@@ ce building . two repor@@ ters in the 19@@ 30s , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts expos@@ ing his smiling face with glasses or his typical pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their night@@ mares , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a Son@@ der At@@ tor@@ ney General was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most of the thousands of kill@@ ings associated with drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime every year , the kill@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to court .
at Ri@@ o@@ dol@@ ce , they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a although they are un@@ comfor@@ ting and although the terrain is now more tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of safety has little use , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we mi@@ str@@ ust all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15 Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ dol@@ ce in the provincial capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; twel@@ fth river . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but there &apos;s practically nothing to silence about Val@@ dez .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and the extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as rival fac@@ tions struggle here to fill the vacuum .
it does not matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of orn@@ ate , two @-@ storey m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug roy@@ als , which are bigger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; rest &quot; when only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ dol@@ ce , was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
at first there was in February the publication of an interview with Damascus Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el fac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , presum@@ ed ga@@ thers purchased each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake lay in forcing Val@@ dez , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story , to leave the country for its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ dol@@ ce and sold 50 US dollar hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug @-@ tox@@ in problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
repor@@ ters loved to be able to publish very accurate investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ dol@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for her coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history , wherever she led .
he gave up voluntarily that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to live on , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take over the task that suits you as a journalist - either this or you &apos;re playing the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you tell what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ dol@@ ce team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who was able to curse like a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Was his love for the routine his cal@@ am@@ ity ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how best to do her job and stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret starting and run@@ ways , &quot; to move drugs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; anger is , the editor of the o@@ dol@@ ce Andr@@ es Vil@@ lar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then things are happening with Ja@@ vier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home .
the landscape changes constantly .
in the space where the employees of Ri@@ o@@ dol@@ ce met for safety training , no mobile phones suddenly were allowed . days earlier , it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is exclusively sold to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ size neighbourhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some repor@@ ters wondered whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who the governor was not trusted .
it is months since the repor@@ ters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are de facto under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ o@@ dol@@ ce recorded three main stories .
there was assass@@ ination of the brother of the former famous speaker Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to the state expendi@@ tures , which concentrated on the home town of the governor .
and there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Prosecutor , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all political levels almost the whole century .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of corruption due to high @-@ cali@@ ber cases .
Vil@@ lar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous events in this loc@@ ale , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack .
only a few months earlier , the readers would have looked at the Val@@ dez columns as the best informed source of kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vil@@ lar@@ real , 46 , nick@@ named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slender body constitution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office was devoted to the storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists on behalf of the press .
repor@@ ter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez took a few signs and the next morning went to a demonstration for another journalist on the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; journalists all over the country have become lou@@ der by writing in organised protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on walk@@ ways and constructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the Val@@ dez case .
at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez acc@@ uses the authorities to spy on journalists and kill them because they told the truth .
she has since asked her to be re @-@ divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity .
Val@@ dez said repeatedly that journalists in Mexico were &quot; surrounded by organised crime , government officials and an in@@ different society . &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces that were hiding under a blanket with organised crime .
last year , the media group &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; accounted for more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you die in Mexico , because they want you to keep your mouth shut , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
apparently , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as cart@@ el : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones placed next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava B@@ reach in March .
others continue , as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it &apos;s hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for danger .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben E@@ spin@@ osa , who was murdered together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , admitted that drug traffi@@ cking was frigh@@ tened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , so I became repor@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ dol@@ ce sat on the pav@@ ement in front of the office and drinking beer when all their phones started to bu@@ zz@@ ing .
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with belt riv@@ als and security forces near the village of Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate as promised by a number of cart@@ el emb@@ assi@@ es in the region .
from the cur@@ b edge they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ dol@@ ce via mobile phone .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens he@@ eded up nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez took a look at the polic@@ emen who kept watch to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid at all , they did not show it .
under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ o@@ dol@@ ce followed his tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if on the same day , when Ja@@ vier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her to the street for reporting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , albeit a frigh@@ tening .
researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the incredible N@@ ash@@ ore of a Canadian min@@ er were so well preserved that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even find out that his sc@@ aly skin was red@@ dish brown - and they said she had something of a &quot; troubled past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r specimens in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of noc@@ tur@@ nal animals living in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his incredibly well @-@ preserved condition aston@@ ishes researchers who describe it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to National Ge@@ ographic reports , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he dig@@ ged in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine on March 21 , 2011 near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
he met something that was out of place from the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy earth cl@@ umps .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you only smile a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it was sleeping , &quot; said the author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers have discovered that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although covered with arm@@ or and resembles a shifting tank , probably was threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the strongly arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counter @-@ sh@@ ading , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed it to better mix in its surroundings and to ev@@ ade its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family made head@@ lines in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta Mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli to the museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team who spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours with meti@@ culous discovery .
the amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ or about his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a common defence method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its under@@ side .
although the sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising since the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds the animals living today .
it indicates that din@@ osau@@ rs were hun@@ ted by enough pressure by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution favor@@ ed the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most of the contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or sh@@ ing@@ les - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loo@@ t , indicating that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behaviour on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs must have been the pre@@ dat@@ ors of the cra@@ yon , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to investigate the animal for clu@@ es about life , including its con@@ served intestinal content , to find out what it has eaten as its last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , fell into a river and was pushed into the sea , where he sank on his back to the bottom of the sea .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as South Fl@@ oria today , and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much further inland than they are today .
&quot; this noc@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved , fla@@ ky skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; Brown MEP said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you do not need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only use a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that he is asleep . &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous Period was a time when huge Ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , standing on two legs , crossed the Earth .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was drow@@ ned after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in the mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he dig@@ ged in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine on March 21 , 2011 near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
according to the museum , it is the best preserved ar@@ din@@ osau@@ r in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips prot@@ ru@@ ding from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the underwater hull of the din@@ osau@@ r kept its arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ nants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the front branches still cover b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ resh@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a win in the Lotto .
the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right foref@@ oot is at his side , his five fingers are spread upwards .
I can count the scales on his sole . &quot;
in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ us on A@@ 8 : many wounded
heavy accident on Thursday evening at the A@@ 8 : just under 30 vehicles are wrapped in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , kilometres long st@@ out and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured during a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on Thursday afternoon .
according to the first information of the police , around 17.@@ 00 o &apos;clock between the inter@@ connections between Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) , nearly 30 vehicles , including trucks , crashed into each other during a thunder@@ storm .
the exact number of injured parties did not initially provide any information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a matter of mild to moderate injuries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a huge bid for rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of Munich , a round trip of about ten kilometres was formed .
like an A@@ Z repor@@ ter reports , there was also on the opposite @-@ road to massive obstruc@@ tions - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire department noted the characteristics of the vehicle operators who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pun@@ ishments .
shortly after 18 : 45 hrs a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; Comfort &apos;s check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : there is nothing remin@@ ding you on the train and sleeping .
or one is deep@@ ened into his work and has just a brilliant thought .
and then : buff@@ alo .
the conductor comes and w@@ akes an uns@@ ink@@ able or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket control .
you just confirm by mobile phone that you take your seat and vali@@ date the ticket .
currently , a test run runs on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the offer arrives , we extend it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available in many more long distances in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the train card depreci@@ ation without she@@ ep@@ skin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use them , however , some requirements have to be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - what most passengers do anyway .
it also has to be purchased via the web app that DB Navigator was purchased , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway .
and last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
because the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works like this : you get into the train , call your ticket to &quot; My Tickets . &quot;
a button for electronic de@@ valuation appears at the test customers .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the reserved seat Y .
when the train driver arrives at the ticket inspection at PLA@@ Y , he knows that there is a passenger with an already paid online ticket .
you can continue to sleep , work on , keep silent .
the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the rail - which in turn should take advantage of the passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to travel without ticket control by our train atten@@ dant , simply check out in the DB Navigator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this allows passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB marketing executive board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket inspections are among the biggest off@@ ences .
because often you have , in any case , one of the fellow travelers does not have all the documents you need for de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card is missing or a document that you have to show .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ d@@ ants and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the part or large room and delays in controlling one &apos;s own tickets and the conductor at the end takes time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that &apos;s only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other train numbers on the same route are not yet available .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was shaken to her core .
only one day after she arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; the police just killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it &apos;s still on the street , &quot; he said there .
confused , since nobody else had posted the information in their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the handle @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly saved on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was about to twe@@ eten the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretching out on the street and remaining there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thought Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new to them and their community .
she stopped her cell phone to return to T@@ we@@ ets later in the evening over people on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive .
there were photos of the police band and people who cried , and of a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father who had a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed in which a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman asked his gun and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remembered her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt shi@@ vering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and wept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she fet@@ ched her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the theme of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from 11 .
it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resili@@ ence that exists from the perspective of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter , carrying a flower @-@ dress and a matching crown , went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two discussed a conversation that they had &quot; over the black experience and the black condition several times before this morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she was saying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take it with me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is happening today is a high point of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know and see it and be drawn up in it .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to liber@@ ate ourselves .
even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience bl@@ at@@ ant rac@@ ism , she is no different from the next black female child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I &apos;d give it a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place against the police authority , which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ prosecution of Offic@@ ers Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined a local business@@ man who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass it on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; my activ@@ ism totally changed after 9 August , &quot; she said , and noted that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , the chair of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black municipalities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it &apos;s all coming . &quot;
weeks later , during an evening demonstration , Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came into mind : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had heard that people born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around death row in@@ mates .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other locals followed the team of Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brown &apos;s shooting .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks or talks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; Davis said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are portra@@ yed , for so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a mes@@ si@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film .
as a result , documents showing &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ &apos;s life as she falls in love with her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and the person@@ alization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ferr@@ is &apos;s story also repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement who have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media after killing the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 identify themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement as a whole , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is held upright by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Fer@@ rel@@ l was selected because of her identity as the heart of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no accident , even though it was at the forefront because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman stands as much on the deck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long disappeared , but the racial ties between the church and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels bound to this memory since she went to the street three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV viewers discuss Bit @-@ Gallery
the bit gallery moves people , even though they have not been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has been dividing the population into pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
the topic hardly leaves one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some say a bit gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; no human being &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) .
while the pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery attracts more customers into the city , from which the rest of the shops also profit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding .
added to this : the gallery is planned precisely on the plot , where the farmers market hall stands where 13 direct market@@ ers are able to offer their products .
at the beginning of the construction work it will end .
the gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - for the Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with possibility to sit outside .
Sim@@ one rooms : &quot; for many years we have been buying almost weekly in the farmers market hall .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farm women always very gladly .
we also discovered the but@@ cher shop for us .
we would like to wish that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct market@@ ers settle in a market hall in the gallery will depend on the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the new project probably won &apos;t be very low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what &apos;s the purpose of buying in Bit@@ burg ?
whether it &apos;s clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I think it &apos;s superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is already enough of this in our city .
one can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains to us .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , is mostly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive .
as you can see , stores in a shopping mall are only rented by larger companies , as the r@@ ents there are often un@@ sustainable for a retailer .
too bad , specialty shops are almost no longer and that which is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a Mark@@ thalle doesn &apos;t fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where should the farmers market hall go during the construction period ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ de@@ ka &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes at some point . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or does the gh@@ ost bit gallery manage to distribute all the stores from Bit@@ burg before ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it just won &apos;t work .
and there is no need for a shopping center that is empty .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmers market instead of this gallery .
but there &apos;s no place for a peasant market hall thanks to the crazy many - as I find - meaning@@ less building projects in Bit@@ burg .
when the peasant market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing &apos;s DNA
in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are seen - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and hair@@ cuts sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the cut @-@ outs out of Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where former intelligence analy@@ st for@@ fei@@ ted a 35 @-@ year sentence after making diplomatic reports publicly published on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on August 2 is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( A suitable likeness ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and a pioneering dissi@@ dent whose condem@@ nation was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .
by algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , which was extracted from Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , how someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data could look , a sharp , albeit somewhat intellectual commentary not only for the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also created for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison her image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ and @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing clearly sits on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette but@@ ts and ch@@ ewing gum by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look .
this was the time she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition .
and she could not visit at that time and she could not be photographed , so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a portrait of DNA .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated m@@ use became an un@@ equal letter of letters , which during the course of two years exchanged several letters .
they even created a comic book &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future where President Chel@@ ny would transform judgment and she would be able to personally see the exhibition .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , leaving Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome kind of happy meeting .
there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender forces in order to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to keep the rigid divisions that he should actually fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing with her over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is marked with a heart ) was an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose foundation was gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall , their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ fold of Cs and Gs and As , is written in pencil .
through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific en@@ cyclo@@ pa@@ edia of the artist ) , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show how aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in biological regards , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully take with them is that our gen@@ ome does not care who we are and how open genetic data is for interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , stored in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned comic book .
she shows Mann@@ ing how she appears with a hands @-@ on on hands from the discipline barracks of the United States like King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they make your speech cold , then they have won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop your mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she had to do it , she will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simulations , which rally like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , where their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with a pencil .
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University for murder
a country @-@ wide ch@@ ase is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford who are looking for susp@@ ects after a man has been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .
on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as evi@@ den@@ ced by the acts of the District Court of Cook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au died 26 , after several en@@ grav@@ ings .
a community warning system published by the police authority of Chicago states that the body was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead at the scene of the event , and det@@ ectives are investigating the stit@@ ches as murder while the police actively seek the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
since 2007 she has been Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University .
Alan K. Fall@@ bage , Vice President for University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that it was now being assessed and excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal case investigated by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for the University and Som@@ er@@ ville college said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in any way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to be .
chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly insi@@ sted on the susp@@ ects to submit to the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them reinforce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip , saying that something had happened in apartment 100@@ 8 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that hold and alarm were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the inhabitants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and resear@@ ches a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in co @-@ operation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map has been updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of WA@@ DA &apos;s schedule to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for rein@@ statement R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the Organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything is implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , one of the criteria listed in the list states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the WA@@ DA by Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren for alleged state sponsored dop@@ ing in Russian sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in regard to the matter , mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation , because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programs and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mut@@ ations agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission .
in conversation with Russian sales outlet r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov gave problems to the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one has proposed to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia as part of the D@@ oping Sk@@ and@@ als by the WA@@ DA .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
following a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow organisation in July , WA@@ DA general director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moves &quot; in the right direction , &quot; in order to be re @-@ used .
Al@@ di does not sell eggs for the time being
the company groups shared this with them .
it was a mere precau@@ tionary measure ; it could not be preceded by any health distur@@ b@@ ance , it was said in the communication .
from now on , only eggs are likely to be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been proven to have been tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ ateral anti @-@ lice bites .
Al@@ di wanted to make clarity and transparency with his customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your staff at your e @-@ commerce @-@ start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
responses were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; there was never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed .
she has called for help from the outside .
a new breed of Human Resources start @-@ ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to address surveys , offer specialist groups and demographic groups , employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to b@@ ypass the C @-@ suite executives and contact the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where is Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said they had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T .
in addition to the snap poll@@ s and surveys of specific teams , it offers a heat @-@ card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval results - so that you can re@@ boot , why .
companies come to see that they must remain at the top of the workplace culture so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber , who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken were punished .
this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity for start @-@ ups such as G@@ LIN@@ T .
the global governance , regulation and compliance industry could reach more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , following the finance @-@ related Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments website .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps prevent and disc@@ ern bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year amid the U@@ ber @-@ fin in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ cent can send &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surveys , collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that allows employees to report bad behavior .
and when the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; public opinion condem@@ ns regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and CEO of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company is found that treats its employees badly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , has appointed Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
in the past , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often an in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good way to prosec@@ ute the complaints of employees .
now that the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that previously were hidden in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed faster - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair intern@@ ships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the Risk Management Group from Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to seriously increase ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 , after Arthur Ander@@ sen &apos;s accounting firm had collap@@ sed due to ethical bre@@ aches by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer their software as a service and burden the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
cent received $ 10 million in financing in February by firms like S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and raised its entire financing to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees are expecting more from their jobs than before .
high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only stak@@ es in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley .
employees want to feel that you are accepted and valued , and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that owns their voices , and that the work you do is worth it , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience on Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T .
investors reach yields when their portfolio companies are running well . companies work well when employees are committed and committed .
if the third party analytics tools promise to increase commitment and the use of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement is important according to the experts of workplace culture .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ aker of a company does not take action .
indeed , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the shift does not come quickly enough , or not at all , this can cul@@ min@@ ate disappointment and dem@@ oti@@ v@@ ate employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4.000 ideas , you will have to be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies who have left too much on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you will not follow staff will ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now runs monthly sales surveys , was able to initiate actions on the same day if a problem about G@@ LIN@@ T is reported so saved .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , she was able to re@@ organise several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
in the case of Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company will always gain new insights into employees , and it hopes that in the long run this will lead to better bonding of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , then you will lose business .
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it is about 11@@ pm , when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA football players conver@@ ge on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some pulled out their jer@@ sey tops and show off the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these idle minutes are a lunch break .
players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final ex@@ ams after the three hour practice before returning to the water man Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the boys the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday became Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the burden of players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore the first three training sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 7 : 15 p.m. to meet the already packed schedules of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day at which the Bru@@ ins shifted the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as conducted six playing times in West@@ wood practical exercises .
20 years before the beginning of the formal games preparations for the launch of Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said he supported the rule change of the N@@ CA@@ A even if they add another point to the many busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous burden on them for three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they just pushed it through , they continued to plac@@ ate , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices once the camp is finished , which is due to the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjoining Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class , which is already covered with foot@@ balls , which will be a safety net behind a gate post , no easy task .
bru@@ te players are supposed to occupy the hotel this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then stop recording an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video tape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
that &apos;s why I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts verification in combat against counter@@ f@@ eit news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false al@@ erts to third parties and then show their results under the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible false reports and send them to fac@@ tual audi@@ tors that may display results of the fact test from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential election .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to be punished according to social media networks if they fail to quickly eradic@@ ate hat@@ eful post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook announced in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts test will be launched in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; in addition to finding out which stories of fac@@ tual audi@@ tors are challenged by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions on what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product manager for Facebook news in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 &quot; s and 1980 &apos;s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy seat in the Ir@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ i@@ red Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says with melanch@@ oly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wi@@ cz , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; I only re@@ acted to the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s that worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb @-@ print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell like smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were itself .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome pit &quot; ) this all seems too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , exploring the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ch .
he wander@@ ed through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape pat@@ ties , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust acquired full access only in 2006 , when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the cler@@ ks just started to look after the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years , in which aristo@@ cr@@ ats said , &quot; Oh , cast it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the period of English Emp@@ ires , cards showing who had something : &quot; you might think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; Rho@@ des says , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families .
guys , let &apos;s go ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader base , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant revol@@ t of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a recording of an u@@ pro@@ ar that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book titled &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , Rho@@ des says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising started in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; maybe the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as The Pri@@ est , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ter who hid the Dar@@ rel@@ l family for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; in which the smu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l was portra@@ yed in the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gentlemen appeared to be Ga@@ un@@ er , always pay debts and spend money on things they couldn &apos;t afford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ men solved their school crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to adverti@@ se within . &quot;
after the end of his placement in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences
he has spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ mä@@ ki , the terrain of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle hiding in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the inauguration of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honne@@ f started its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand on Friday .
until Thursday Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team intend to keep the logo and slogan secretly .
at the end of August there will be a celebration on Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th Island as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorf chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think this ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they write on their website which was un@@ locked yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in essence , we believe that as Bad Honne@@ f , we are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it goes on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate a single @-@ standing promise , one that gives the city a unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , she stands in competition with other communities .
the city of Bad Honne@@ f will cost a mid five @-@ digit amount to its new umbrella brand and campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
each year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises on pensions and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
so this week too .
at first glance , a normal process .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the general staff building , as before , but at the presi@@ dency of the Prime Minister .
under the presi@@ dency of the He@@ ads of State , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the consultations .
this was the number of civilians in the Y@@ AS .
the government tigh@@ tens the re@@ ins in the military .
the chief of staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the air forces and the nav@@ y were de@@ posed .
since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan has fired the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als in 16@@ 9 .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erdo@@ gan as a wire @-@ pul@@ ler of the coup attempt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against 4@@ 86 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt , this week has been negotiated in Ankara . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God &apos;s gift &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely clean &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have a grip on the army ?
at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article titled &quot; Un@@ ease in Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; of the army which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the head@@ set ban for female soldiers , wrote the paper .
in any case , the large @-@ scale teaching of the army and security forces continues .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan decre@@ ed another 7@@ 3@@ 95 war servic@@ er , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan was t@@ aming the military .
the gener@@ als used to g@@ rie@@ ve earlier than the actual masters of the country .
three times they put@@ ted their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
following his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan re@@ pressed the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform requirements of the European Union .
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is pur@@ pos@@ efully pushing ahead a Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a name @-@ called officer , who sought asylum in foreign countries after the attempted coup attempt , would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if that happens , such a development could not leave NATO cold .
in any case , there are doubts about the operational readiness of the Turkish army in the Alliance after the pur@@ ges .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington alters the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media .
it envis@@ ages lowering the legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter rules on obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permits and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by changing the way in which citizens from other countries are dealt with Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate track for racing bike
over the past few months , again and again the future of the racing platform has been con@@ ten@@ tious - now it &apos;s time to go very quickly .
even before the end of the year , the road on which the tourist train runs is to be built .
in order to secure the future of the racing platform in the long term , construction work on the track should begin this year according to the Ministry of Transport .
&quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is committed to this particularly important link for tourism , &quot; explained traffic secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt .
he reduced the costs for the repair of the route to about 2.5 million euros .
from this sum , the country cap@@ tures 75 percent .
the contract , based on which the shuttle should also be ordered by the country in the future , is currently being fin@@ alised , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen Bahn as operator are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards have been negotiated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this meant that the race stei@@ g shuttle should be ordered regular on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g Shuttle is a popular rail link between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
over the past few months , it has been tested in the course of a pilot plant , whether the route is used by sufficient number of people to order them regularly in the future .
the route is also partly steep in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry about
just as you thought it can &apos;t be even cra@@ zier in 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the area of sex robots comes .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , professor of robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must begin to take her ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
&quot; people are making fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more often , &quot; said Mr Sh@@ ark@@ ey in the publication of his new report .
modern sex d@@ olls have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also adapt his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the robot &apos;s eye color to the shape of the nip@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
but it becomes more wor@@ rying as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; who would let a Step@@ ford woman look progressive .
modern sex d@@ olls have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot , for example , makes it possible for its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ end@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that suits your personality as well as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enth@@ uses the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she likes what you like and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day it also has its m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , be fixed on conversation or she can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive feminine features that make all@@ u@@ sions to rape when one gets a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( called here : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah is concerned , disturbing one most .
on his website , True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy was compatible with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men not have Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just a different sex toy .
their formation and growing refin@@ ement point to something Dun@@ c@@ eres and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional en@@ core .
most men will of course not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notices its increasing popularity , they still remain on the br@@ ink of consumer culture .
but what se@@ eps out of the peripheral zones can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging at a time when the rights of women in the world are threatened in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted women .
the most deter@@ rent aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the worn body and the st@@ och@@ ian eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as realistic as technically feasible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their gro@@ wers want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , to the point when it comes to its &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots do not represent real women .
they cannot separate or simply walk away from their companion .
they have no intermedi@@ ation or background story , nothing that points to independence or anything that could distur@@ b the fantasy of total subj@@ ection .
in other words , they are pleasing slaves .
or to express it in the language of 2017 : maid
lac@@ t@@ m high performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense of human dignity
it has become a tru@@ ism of the pump era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized the US elec@@ torate have also split families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers in the USA with advice about how to deal with the horror of cho@@ king relatives .
we are all going to ex@@ ert ourselves to burst our filter bubbles .
less noticed is the power of bringing bund@@ les , families together .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lef@@ tist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful impact .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House anyone whom she knows , including the repub@@ li@@ can kin@@ ship , with whom she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite peculi@@ arly on the same side .
for the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it is important to me that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the resulting effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right .
when we talk of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the sp@@ ook@@ y possibility that his bi@@ bs will not be rep@@ elled some@@ day anymore .
there is , however , an even worse long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump re@@ public@@ ans &quot; norm@@ alize &quot; the right wing , which suddenly appear as an ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards .
today I find myself falling from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s hil@@ arious version of the decline - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact seem to be one of very mild crimes .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must be mentally healthy to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels in the New York park department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cre@@ ep@@ y and the animals twist to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ sparkling music con@@ veys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found that Swiss Cot@@ tage is in fact not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the Top@@ ic Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not one - but a big round@@ about in northern London .
however , the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ el is still a strange magical experience , since there are two two @-@ year @-@ olds , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ year @-@ olds on it and all have a great time .
if I could have evaluated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required .
the poor woman in the department store stood ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ tically gri@@ ev@@ ingly , while I was tired of experiencing her credit card with five stars .
Oscar Gu@@ ori@@ us with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .
last year he was hospit@@ alized due to the treatment of cuts on his hand joints , according to which he was re@@ port@@ edly tor@@ tured by the prison authorities in one case in his cell .
because of murder of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valentine &apos;s Day by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cab in his home in Pre@@ t@@ oria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a noc@@ tur@@ nal intru@@ der who hid in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say they are too len@@ i@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Prosec@@ ution Service said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection may be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is in danger of being punished for 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as farmer Arnold found a curious egg
as the last of the schools of Blum@@ berger , the fourth @-@ grade students from F@@ hats and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were placed on holiday and in the secondary schools .
three of the in@@ let students will go to school in the future , four to the secondary school .
school director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen on Tuesday evening .
the 29 students of the four classes , led by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , elected a young eagle , who grew up in the poultry farm , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to achieve this , the lively flock brought a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Der Adler in ckens &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and sent it away from his chi@@ ckens .
instead of a chi@@ ckens , a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of him sm@@ ashed , and the eagle stretched out his wings on a high mountain .
after that the classes showed three and four in the studio of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens danced with the young go@@ ck@@ eln , the cylinders carried to the bet .
the eagle stands for integration , said school director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte .
the young animal is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
its purpose is to be free .
she wished every quarter @-@ vessel to feel accepted in his new school .
it was thanks to the colleagues , former school director Michael Müller , who repeatedly jump@@ ed into instruc@@ tional pedi@@ ments and the parents &apos; representatives .
the cu@@ cum@@ ber time is over , class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher said .
after two years of teaching , she was very reluct@@ ant to leave her pup@@ il , because it had been a really great time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , they can rely on the four @-@ handed people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end , all students left a song of summer time and holiday season .
there was great joy in the children .
eight first @-@ grade students have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned in Greece because of illegal camps , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted by TV .
on the morning of August 1 , a group of illegal people was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia by the police , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released while an investigation is underway .
the State Department reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek authorities have sharpen@@ ed control of the free camping and lay down substantial fin@@ es for anyone who is not meant to stay in a place intended for this purpose . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what people need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to take part in the action ?
an overview of the most important questions and answers .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they aim to improve the emission behaviour of cars in emissions categories Euro 5 and in part Euro 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anja S@@ met@@ anin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new promotion mandatory ?
no , the software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates prior to that are only valid for the vehicles that have become the Schum@@ an software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Federal Office of Transport ( KBA ) ordered their retro@@ fitting .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced a swift implementation in the coming months , but not yet called an exact date .
Daimler advised to write to each person affected .
if any inspection is due anyway , it will be settled in its framework .
how long will the conver@@ sions take place overall ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
this depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from the political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen that car manufacturers have not acted voluntarily on the issue of the environment up to now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming it could be to get an appointment .
what do drivers do , who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE advises to wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would consult , so S@@ met@@ anin .
is there a massive decline in the price of Euro 4 cars ?
the ACE fears this .
but even in the regions where driving b@@ ans thre@@ aten .
up to now there is no loss of value for older diesel in rural areas .
the ACE advises to wait for a sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to be political .
one of the prize @-@ winners does not want to come - in protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards at the prestigious Kennedy Center .
as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the scholars .
the awards will be presented at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and join his wife Mel@@ ania at the award ceremony .
the award winner Le@@ ar , who has been recently announced with progressive TV series , has therefore already announced to refrain from attending the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presi@@ dency has decided to neg@@ lect the arts and human rights - even to withdraw funds - and that bur@@ sts me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphas@@ ised that she will use Tr@@ ump to make clear her views .
the Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
former prize winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city life worth
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ lach City Buil@@ der , reti@@ res in R@@ ente next year .
the place is already written - but suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been a town builder for 31 years .
and the work is still great fun for him , as he medi@@ ates in the press brief@@ ing .
he reports of varied but challenging tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , it is surprising that so far no application has fulfilled the requirements profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible date .
this should be enough time for a review , taking into account the regular periods of notice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Has@@ lach acts as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lower House of Building Law &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the Administr@@ ative Community , the applicant has to present appropriate conclusions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if they were unable to fill them out , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for consultation .
but the clos@@ eness to the city is important to the city and itself , says W@@ acker , who reports about a good working climate and good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , and the W@@ acker looks back with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city life worth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is confident about the building office and his staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ planer @-@ park , for example , came across .
the Kin@@ zig bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium renovation is still subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter will cost around 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; W@@ acker appreci@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my success@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
design is available for a city building master with great le@@ e@@ way .
with Has@@ lach &apos;s own yard and hor@@ ti@@ culture , many things can be re@@ acted quite flexibly .
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the old town as an ensemble is under monument protection , it is important to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have an eye on what goes in &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going city building master emphasizes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyway , the Mayor has a high level of responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything is running here over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been working for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker wants his successor for a long time : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the spot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working climate but also for the further design of the city .
according to information from the town of Has@@ lach , who would like to get buried Roland W@@ acker should have a completed degree as a graduate engineer or bach@@ elor with special@@ isation in architecture and have good specialist knowledge in the fields of construction planning and building planning law .
the municipal building office is subject to high and civil engineering , construction planning , renovation , administration of urban properties , Municipal Court with the building yard and the Stadt@@ g@@ ärt@@ ner@@ ei , as well as Lower construction law office , including historic monument protection .
bike thrown on lines : closed on the south run@@ way
according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bike on the lines in the area of the Le@@ oben Road ( B@@ 116 ) .
these were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetr@@ ators and have been searching for them since the hours of the night .
a red sco@@ oter and a bicycle driver were observed by witnesses close to the scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond the borders of Lausanne , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ators themselves would have brought themselves into great danger and also end@@ anger the train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the system as well as the delay of the delay and the costs for the replacement of the railways , the recipients of the railway could also come to the perpetr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum was to be assumed , the spokes@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages had been repaired on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south run@@ way could be guided without disabilities .
nearly ten passenger trains dropped out on Friday morning , two of them concerned the long @-@ distance traffic .
freight trains were not falling , but they were delayed .
according to Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch , about 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study says just the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the incur@@ able condition affecting around 1.3 million in the US and 300@@ ,000 in the United States causes stomach cra@@ mps and blo@@ ating , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , weight loss and extreme ti@@ redness .
while those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found at the University of Washington that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to the development of immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna explained that immune cells pat@@ rol in the gut in order to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food do not penetrate the body .
cells capable of det@@ aching inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging delicate tissue .
if the equilibrium is too far towards inflammation , an inflammatory bow@@ el disease can result .
in experiments we found that a kind of tolerance stimulating immune cell is found in mice that carry a particular bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a kind of bacteria - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells promoting tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han would tolerate less toler@@ able , less flamm@@ able intestinal mi@@ li@@ eus , if the same system also affects people .
the post@@ doctoral student , Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan , examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , but it was not accommodated .
it assumed that the difference between the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the mice &apos;s intest@@ ines were sequ@@ enced and found six species of bacteria present in mice with the immune cells , but without them in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lack@@ ed intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they were given L. reu@@ ter@@ i and immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i was able to grow in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on im@@ mature immune cells isolated by the mice .
the immune cells developed to the toler@@ ant cells .
when the active component was cleaned out of the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as an in@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in mice food , the number of such cells increased by around 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that humans have the same toler@@ ant cells as mice , and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han supplements from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho thinks Manchester United has a genius &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; genius &quot; with Manchester United , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes after the mid@@ fiel@@ der made his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pounds of signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup ki@@ cked off against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the Hol@@ der role , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched as they wished .
however , matic was excluded from the pre @-@ preparation Asia tour of the blues and achieved only 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the Premier League season started .
&quot; he takes time , but his experience , intelligence , genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; M@@ our@@ in@@ ho said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u started in the Avi@@ va stadium when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent disclosed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted three more new commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four priority new commitments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have taken great trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; Pain@@ ts &quot; Dream@@ liner in the Sky
the aircraft manufacturer Boeing has drawn the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner into the sky .
the pilots flew off Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in US state Mich@@ ig@@ an and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the shape of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new depth stop for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind still rot@@ ates : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was the SPD leader , Social @-@ Democratic Prime Ministers always looked for Berlin with a certain concern .
the chief wish of the electoral champi@@ ons was merely not a cross@@ wind of the party headquarters , but no head@@ wind from the League .
since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally .
since then , the staff from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus am monitoring the events in the SPD @-@ governed provincial capitals .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with a head@@ wind .
there were heart@@ beats .
and one by one .
according to the surprising ending of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the German federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows once again : red @-@ green can simply not rule reliably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U secretary general Peter Tau@@ ber , the editorial board of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
s &amp; D Group President Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) over@@ threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) .
five months before the elections , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green Party executive Michael Kell@@ ner sum@@ mon@@ ed El@@ ke T@@ westen &apos;s back@@ sliding Lower @-@ Saxon Gre@@ ens to return her mandate .
the transfer to CD@@ U signi@@ fies a clear distortion of the vot@@ er &apos;s will .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen must return her mandate immediately , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal President and election campaign manager of the Gre@@ ens to the Editorial Board of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this may not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD campaig@@ ner si@@ ghs when the new hi@@ ob@@ session message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is there after the transition of the green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ westen to CD@@ U without own government majority .
it is the provisional highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD &apos;s state associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the misery began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , nothing more , the comrades at that time cal@@ med down .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
that &apos;s what it was - and everything got much worse .
the defeat in Kiel caused the SPD to stag@@ ger , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te beat the party smoothly .
in the weeks after that the comrades ra@@ ped again .
then , when they had just plu@@ cked new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg came .
and with him came the next drau@@ ght .
mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD country chief , lost his Nim@@ bus this weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because in crisis communication he made everything wrong with what you can do wrong .
since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for its political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW exhaust @-@ gas affair and its role in the Supervisory Board , Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister has been in criticism for some time now .
am@@ ese survey values were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps just for this reason , Wei@@ l always tried to make accents in the League over the past few weeks .
the efforts of the former Mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin , too , did not remain hidden in Martin Schulz &apos;s environment .
they let him go , because they promised to stabil@@ ise the party from Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could happen .
in doing so , Wei@@ l is not guilty of the internal co@@ er@@ cion of the Lower @-@ Saxon Gre@@ ens .
and Schulz is not at all .
in the meantime , comrades try to keep their own ranks closed .
her anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here , above all , to the back@@ sliding parliam@@ ent@@ arian T@@ westen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ westen puts her own career starter on the interests of all the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the Editorial Network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. T@@ westen has not been elected as a direct candidate for her individual but over the state list of the Lower @-@ Saxon Gre@@ ens in parliament , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lower Saxony &apos;s de@@ pu@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , lam@@ ents an &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters &apos; willingness to vote four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l a prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a leading candidate in the parliamentary elections , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U member fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for clari@@ fying the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments from the CD@@ U of Lower Saxony .
funding for local nucle@@ us III
anyone who wants to rehabil@@ itate his house in the years can get support from the country in the near future .
the Mayor , Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives , informed the city development on Wednesday in sens@@ ations .
at the beginning of the inform@@ ational event , Sch@@ in@@ dler gave a review of what happened so far .
since 1991 , there have been renov@@ ations in sens@@ ations .
at that time , in the refurb@@ ishment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the existing renov@@ ations are a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - it is ultimately important to promote the interior development , not only to open up new construction areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on April 4 , the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a refurb@@ ishment area III .
the sum of funding amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which 500 000 Euro came from the country , the rest of the community felt .
what is the development of a remedi@@ ation area ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I will continue to investigate , as Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role if there is interest in the planned territory to rehabil@@ itate .
if necessary , the territorial boundaries could then also be postpon@@ ed .
the bridge represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal state programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Town &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the restructuring would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program is the re@@ vit@@ alization of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , that is , per property .
the rehabilitation area would then finally be set as a statute .
the grant period for the funds has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
until September this year , however , it would only be possible to take stock of the survey , in which the participants in the rehabilitation project received a questionnaire for filling out .
as far as possible , in November or December , it should take place as long as possible , so that the refurb@@ ishment can begin in the coming year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently declared that each commune must carry out the aforementioned preliminary examinations .
it is about evaluating the urban@@ istic gri@@ ev@@ ances and deciding when it is being rehabil@@ itated and to what extent .
for the respective property there will be a note in the land register as well .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will again come back to his senses and make a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised that an essential success factor for the project was the participation of the participants .
this is why there will be questionn@@ aires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and completed by the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; with which it works among other things about the structural condition and the renovation views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house@@ keeping and housing arc &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; information about size , division and residents of a living space can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arc &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be filled if business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it is worth not@@ ing that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not eligible for funding .
Sch@@ in@@ dler also stressed that the distribution of subsidies according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; works - who first comes , grin@@ ds first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you cannot make any funding for later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Location II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; renovation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or sets himself a micro@@ chip to get into house and car with a hand movement
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his front door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has partner@@ ed with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standard .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the palaces of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , everything for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock .

the advertising expenses of the White House cost the tax@@ pa@@ yer thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a nav@@ y helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military given to the TI@@ ME magazine up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was at the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence , and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the helicopter , manufactured in Connec@@ ti@@ cut , has been on display next to a Ma@@ ine Yacht , a Wis@@ con@@ sin fire@@ fighter and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or cargo , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it , because it is such an unusual event with a high visibility , &quot; the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 wrote on the eve of the event to his superi@@ ors , the deputy commander of the Nav@@ al Aviation .
the news indicated that the helicopter arrived at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 p.m. and so long until the tur@@ f was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would be required for the return flight .
the original flight crew was during the event with the helicopter , while the security personnel of the unit stayed on the floor during the time on the plane .
from the records provided by the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was required .
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could viol@@ ate the destination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; the commander wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds like you &apos;re locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an impetus for the reform of the health reform that was in progress in the Senate and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically advantageous purposes , is hardly a new phenomenon .
pres@@ idents shall be obliged to use them for the journey .
but to request their use for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation in February when the presidential jet proved to be in front of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compla@@ ined about the use of the presidential jet by his predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which shows products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often conduct training flights in the area around Washington and in the South La@@ wn , in order to reduce the U.S. President in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 Summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 practice land@@ ings in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted during the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; helicop@@ ters also flew 11 hours on that day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential missions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers took the burden of none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a Si@@ kor@@ sky spokes@@ man said the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budget desig@@ nations for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the Stat@@ utes of the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement amount for the V@@ H @-@ 3 is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour .
unit Records list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual costs for operation of the helicopter are far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract signing .
at that time , the former press secretary of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things that are made in America this week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the federal state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud to contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think most Americans are all proud of helicop@@ ters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , it is appropriate to highlight that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear if Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he took his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss against tri@@ cky task
the leader of the Second Tennis League will join the table third of the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
the TC Blue @-@ Weiss ninth will take place tomorrow from 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the table third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
despite the five games still imp@@ ec@@ cable balance sheet , the leader of the second Tennis League has gotten the sense of reality .
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay , in any case , has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think the team is very good at the back positions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
imports from the Far North are mainly concerned for class and stability at S@@ V &apos;s S@@ V .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to operations in the Davis Cup .
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ fer@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be hard for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good portion of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high North is convenient .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ four .
if the Fren@@ ch@@ man who is currently active at the Chall@@ enger event in the Italian bi@@ ella is not part of the Bundes@@ liga match , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) play@@ w@@ right at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec will be in its first use this season .
the hitherto un@@ defeated Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Cas@@ tillo came with the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ sky at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
he should also be present in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and Belgian Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two wins last Sunday against the Club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could once again cr@@ ush the team .
if it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was the number one of the junior world rank@@ ings in January 2016 , someone from the train@@ ee around Mari@@ us Z@@ ay fills the cad@@ re .
how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump was not really happy when he put his signature on Wednesday evening under the law to intensi@@ fy sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress had packed a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he et@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ iled against US aggression .
after all , the draft plan intends to punish European companies that will help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU .
correspon@@ dingly , since then , investors of the O@@ MV , together with other European companies , are co @-@ financed by the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Management Nord Stream 2 .
the threatening scenery is enormous .
however , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump even had to bring the sanctions to life by an executive order .
twelve arms are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has seen which the corporation could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Nar@@ cos Staff@@ el 3 Tra@@ iler : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cal@@ i Cart@@ el &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is put into the spotlight in the charts of Net@@ fli@@ x . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar killer reveals , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from over .
the three and four seasons have already been confirmed by the streaming service , the first one received their first trailer and showed the latest villa@@ ins of the show .
with the third season , DE@@ A has directed its attention to the world &apos;s rich@@ est drug trade organisation : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell .
led by four powerful sponsors , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company &quot; with more government bri@@ bes and violent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican union , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .
in the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal returns to Ja@@ vier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites US and Colom@@ bian law enforcement authorities to support the war on drugs .
other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry C@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .
the third season of Nar@@ cos will start on September 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the City counts 46 kitchen aids &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city organis@@ es the day @-@ lunch again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
the clock is turned back in the municipal kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
on 1 September the city of Kre@@ feld will take over the food supply in the city day@@ care centres ( Kit@@ as ) again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooked will continue to be out of house : a cat@@ erer takes care of this task and supplies fresh cooked ch@@ illed .
the city operates 46 day nur@@ series in Kre@@ feld area , in 44 children get a hot meal at lunch@@ time .
in the last kite year , 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , not only children who are served 45 hours of the week are eating in the day@@ time &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid for 35 @-@ hour supervision if children stay up to 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time workers have kitchen service from 1st September onwards : they warm up the delivered meals , supplement it with salad , raw vegetables and fruits , por@@ tioning the meal individually , give food out , clean out , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are permanently assigned to a ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two group@@ ed as well as seven group@@ ed facilities - decide on the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen assistants are now part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is what it is all about : healthy food and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a known force in the c@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity should be important to the children .
the cleansing of the K@@ ita rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen staff - is carried out by special cleaning staff in the future .
this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides quality improvement of the kitchen performance also has the charm that it has turned out to be the most economical way in the cost comparison of the city as the most economical way out of the press office .
and this , although 46 part @-@ time forces are reset .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so heavy with about 750 people in the education sector , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
three women are candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credi@@ ble when women participate fully and be involved in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential election will take place on April 5 .
the Tali@@ ban have published threats against a election process which coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat actions to an advisory role .
this year , the elections for the first time will be handed over peac@@ efully by a democr@@ atically elected government to the next .
Hay@@ som said a strong role for women will strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Afgh@@ an independent election commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of 3,@@ 6 million voters .

men try to eradic@@ ate 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried to ro@@ b a 13 @-@ year old girl on Thursday .
according to the police , the men said the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stayed with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 2.@@ 55 pm because they wanted to phone with the girl &apos;s mobile phone .
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request and continued with her friends .
as a result , one of the perpetr@@ ators tried to grab the mobile phone and the girl &apos;s necklace , which , however , failed .
without spo@@ ils the duo fled .
the two young men were later arrested by the police .
the investigations run .
G@@ MB concerns about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie plant in Glas@@ gow
a trade union wants to verify the long @-@ term commitment to production at its Glas@@ gow plant for managers of bis@@ que manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company has kept silent about the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work at the plant , which produces hob@@ by@@ bs and rich tea bis@@ cuits alongside other products .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that workers and trade union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the subsidiary of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s claim to express &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerns that financing for modernization of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ Organ@@ izer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross is deeply affected by our members .
generations of families have worked here and the workers are concentrated on the local community and the Glas@@ gow region , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glas@@ gow is urgently looking for a prosper@@ ous production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman for Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross just received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will react directly to it because we value the continuous commitment to employees and union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives in T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed openly .
we discussed with the employees that we , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uns@@ af@@ e business climate , constantly monitor our business - and this applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross location , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we fully appreciate the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility . if our operations change at the site , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not indul@@ ge in her persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar after issuing an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to release his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years before the world record raid ?
the sensational approach has hal@@ ted the transfer window in the summer , as the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than twice the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returning to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds .
after the termination , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional ath@@ lete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of over 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar forced his way out , although there is a fountain in the proximity of the Catal@@ ans Board that the club always gave his best to take care of him since he arrived in San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned against this prospect three years ago by the PS@@ G president ?
when Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; I am not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi said .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to let one of our players sign in , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , whereby the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circum@@ stance , and Barcelona was able to feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .
sco@@ oter tos@@ sed and damaged
during the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown offen@@ ders intentionally dropped off a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ feld street in front of the property number 30 and thus caused damage to the vehicle of more than 200 Euros .
the police station Sch@@ ram@@ berg , phone 07@@ 4@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for hints .
the police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
driving a car in his lane , the driver had to avoid a VW Tour@@ an and tou@@ red the crash barrier .
on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um with his VW came on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in direction to Le@@ ese on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au .
in the vicinity of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car met him in his lane , so that he had to escape to the right .
the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the control plan .
damage to the car was caused by car damage .
the driver of the coming car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident .
according to the accident damage , it may be good that the accident driver had not noticed the accident at all .
the police are now asking witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the pol@@ lu@@ ter to get in touch with the commission@@ er in Stol@@ zen@@ au at tel . 05@@ 7@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is what author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann believes .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; Wir sind Kirche , &quot; explained after publication to the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur , he acquired an ap@@ ology from the former Regensburg bishop and today &apos;s Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother .
it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their incorrect app@@ rais@@ al of the processes at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that reporting on violence in the domains of the cathedral was measured with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; double standards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in regard to the en@@ cro@@ ach@@ ments in Regensburg , no one doubts that it is a &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful act &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation &quot; was con@@ spic@@ uous as the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of describing the Catholic Church as the source of all ev@@ ils is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you like to go to the church and it &apos;s a dev@@ our@@ ing fres@@ her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pun@@ ches have been a normal educational tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her youth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cope with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to past decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with reports on mis@@ use cases , pop@@ e brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who auth@@ ored the &quot; My brother of the pop@@ e &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) , is completely wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the report report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is the 440 @-@ page report published by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
in total , 5@@ 47 Regensburg dom@@ es were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s with high plau@@ sibility .
the final report said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied .
especially in the case of high emotional appeal , the punishment for the students could be even more intense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to numerous other defend@@ ants , in contrast to numerous other defend@@ ants , many victims under@@ estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in numerous cases , even have positive memories with him in spite of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Cathedral , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , is reli@@ eved of his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incidents of violence on protective char@@ ms at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , many students highlight his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , it also appears as ch@@ ol@@ er@@ ist and perfec@@ tion@@ ist who became more tangible when a domain record didn &apos;t bring any top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is in it at all .
he is just once dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school also occurred outside of its sphere of influence .
at most it is possible to reproach him , to know it too late or to have taken first references seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which it worked was perceived by practically all respon@@ dents as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; redemption &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also presents an excellent testimony , &quot; warm @-@ hear@@ ted , &quot; &quot; popular , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher , who regularly nour@@ ished the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y and &quot; always moved from grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compla@@ ins about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotion@@ ality , which has already led to rage erup@@ tions .
the fact that he didn &apos;t just pop up with chairs and cast the key@@ ring on the floor , but also gave ear @-@ fi@@ gs distributed and too che@@ ek@@ y guys on the hair or ears , he himself admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
to his rescue , however , it has to be said that such educational methods have been widely used in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents and teachers .
do you still know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state gymn@@ asi@@ um .
compared to what actually is in this report , namely the app@@ alling sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school , these are Bag@@ at@@ ellen .
one wonders whether it has to do with his reputation and role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just pl@@ ung@@ ed him .
at the Bavarian pop@@ e , many who never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently .
but the truth is : the report is reli@@ eved by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in connection with the report , the media reported a great deal about the subject of abuse at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger put in the final report any involvement or co @-@ knowledge with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault con@@ tends that they have become familiar with the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were dedicated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said an affected person on behalf of the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in clari@@ fying sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims are silent .
if they did not even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral leader who , professionally , would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators professionally .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students rate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a questioned student formulated it like this : &quot; in terms of sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely insight and could have stopped the respective perpetr@@ ator .
I consider it ... even for really absurd , to assume that it was imp@@ uted to him ... to have a more urgent or clear or even better opening than to their parents , dormit@@ ory managers , trust teachers etc .
that one talks with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report concludes with the clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that pupils and / or their surroundings affected him in advance could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is free to speak out of any co @-@ existence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
neither can he be accused of preventing him or having brought him to the announcement .
that is why there is no reason to link up his good name with these vile crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media , much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused in the report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Look away &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in the reporting everything is mixed and mixed up into a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violent exc@@ uses and somewhere , in the midst of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is again a mis@@ use of the report .
there is a clean separation : between the pre @-@ school and the gymn@@ asi@@ um of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses as well as , let &apos;s say , other alleg@@ ations .
in addition , the report covers incidents from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not a ch@@ oral director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
all the terrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were brut@@ ally har@@ assed and painted , and suffering from them , were all at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to prevail .
but with whom Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got the boys face when they were already on the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , as most witnesses emphasize , the topic of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; primary school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is t@@ abo@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one was only happy to be escaped and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; states .
what was different on the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline already , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore , despite violence , even connect positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the most , the accus@@ ation remains to have looked away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he just started to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was just not working and responsible ( so the witness ) didn &apos;t want to hear anything , and then again around 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently shut the ears off the conditions ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because even in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report even re@@ produces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the pres@@ ch@@ ool , the punishment will continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in the face of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .
that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was that Prü@@ ffer@@ fin@@ es were banned in Bavaria long ago .
before that they happened in a legal grey area , as each of us knows well .
it was also difficult for him to estimate where the people affected might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where really the permissible limit has been crossed .
but you can &apos;t say that he had always looked away .
this is simply not true .
it was only in 1980 that the fine in schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis asser@@ ted that it is unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards to the time at that time .
how do you see it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we historians are talking about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pit@@ fall of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. the danger of evaluating the past according to present moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess is already right .
but this does not , of course , apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ hor@@ red at all times , and also not for what was banned in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond that at that time .
it &apos;s all terrible and I &apos;m glad that it will finally work .
but at the same time , I must take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing , in other words , ears and hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then prohibited , he also strictly adher@@ ed to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what picture of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Regen@@ s@@ burger Zeit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the subject test capital also become a language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , i.e. Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , from his perspective , the dom@@ esti@@ cated cats only played a minor role .
nevertheless , I do not mean by no means that he led a strict regi@@ ment there .
but that must be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without calling for unconditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world @-@ class , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y alone , a rebel@@ li@@ ous boy is no longer a great singer and can stand before any success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
as for a person , you have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks with her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful , humor@@ ous , found@@ ational , deep @-@ hear@@ ted and heart@@ felt people , of whom one can not imagine that he could also do something for a fly .
I get regular contact with how many former dom@@ es still keep contact with him today , 23 years after his retirement , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family .
those who did not forgive him until now , that he was once stern to them , are thus clearly in the minority .
most of the cathedral spar@@ rows are grateful to him today that he en@@ riches her life and has brought to them the world of music .
and that he always is a good , fa@@ ther@@ ly teacher - a strict father , sure , that may be - but also a lovely resp@@ ectable person , to whom they still look up today and which they almost ad@@ ore .
and please , once again clearly : all that one repro@@ aches him are methods of education , which then were on the order of the day .
we can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago .
but it is most un@@ just , a man just because he is promin@@ ently and has a more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent that is behind it , only too obvious .
for the report that has just been published is reli@@ eved of it .
now the lawyer would command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without those outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen finally in peace .
