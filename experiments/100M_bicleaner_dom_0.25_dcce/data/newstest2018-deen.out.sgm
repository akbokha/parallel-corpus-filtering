<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irish institution, where teenagers are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A pit chapel, where now for the S-Bahn tunnel is digged.</seg>
<seg id="4">Farmers cultivate the former ground of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories.</seg>
<seg id="6">It gets nervous when maps are not up to date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this, because the car-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bavaria of the state government, are anything but up-to-date - but especially therefore very informative.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich-based Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large overview map, detailed maps, so-called primeval sheets, were incorporated into cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the Bavarian survey administration, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Her principal: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader had occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops finally moved away with the peace of Lunéville from February 9, 1801, it was today's neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Elector Max IV Joseph promoted the project further, founded the" "" "Topographical Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bavarian survey administration." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The composition sheet for Munich dates back to the year 1856 and is to be found on the homepage of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was joined as a Munich suburb 21 years after the map was created.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Lower Saxony are concentrated around 1856 along the current Plinganserstrasse, which was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today is the Westpark, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: at the entrance there appears a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbered plots of the so-called "primeval" from which the base tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">Today, small plots do not show farmers any more - but farmers of the plant "land in the sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is situated north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">Theresienwiese, the setting of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was indeed still a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of Isar, the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "in the area of the district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" "" "at the Gasteig" "" "or the" "" "Auf der Lüften" "" "in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen - but also in big letters" "" "Irren Anstalt" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße, one once locked people with insanity.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich Circle" "" "Irrenanstalt" "" "was created at the Auer Lüften" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the establishment of the psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and, for example, ended the accusations of the so-called Irish." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">He also prohibited the personnel from using violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients there was first place, later it was extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrence Institution in Haar, 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar Amper Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists since 2006, is located there since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people meet in the Munich Salesianum area on the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with training facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football field of the TSV Munich Ost, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the children house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was erected in architectural allusion to the original construction of the Irrenberg, which was destroyed during the Second World War in bombing raids." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed as" "" "chief place" "" "in 1856, the Kaufingerstraße called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allies bombed many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A great one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English institute, small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line-line will take place.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group publishes Travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the promotion of coloured people has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is scheduled to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls on afro-American travellers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention when travelling across the state, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents occur in recent times throughout the country and are noted here," stated in the Group's opinion.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently passed Bill of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to accuse discrimination, as well as the state's prosecuting authorities, who are disproportionately directed towards minorities, caused the group to issue the warning, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have breaches of civil rights that happen to humans." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "they are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed," "" "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear discomfort in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited events like racist offense against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no petrol at the time of the state and was detained by the police of Missouri without being accused of crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recently published report by Missouri General Attorney Office, showing that in the state, black motorists will be halted 75 percent more often than white people.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," "" "Chapel said." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people have to be willing to bring bail money or let relatives know they're travelling through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 years of hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the Hassan Report Programme of the FBI, which classify the state with respect to the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to accuse a company because of housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued warnings for Texas and Arizona, following the adoption of immigration law, committing local law enforcement authorities to arrest people because of immigration law, which will contribute to further racial profile.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently, interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischbacher Weidewitn project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Members of Parliament Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have taken a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the square yard of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischbacher CDU branch met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann initially provided insights into his farm, where he cultivated 55 hectares of lawns and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and just as many kittens and shelters in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Black Forest" "" "is the alternative waterway for the milk of his cows," "" "says Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "as he is also BLHV chairman of Fischbach, he described the" "" "fundamental importance" "" "as" "" "essential." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot profit profitably on such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area care for a lot of work, much needs to be worked on with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the parental plant and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertiliser, even if it does not lead to bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognised the importance of the fence project and is happy about the leadership development." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the afforestation of the areas could be extended for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue to operate," "" "said the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often in criticism because of the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants.</seg>
<seg id="85">The disclosure area is therefore 40 hectares, which must not be forested until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total costs of 71 500 Euro, half of the participants were fostered, a quarter carried the municipality of Fischbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmer remained 12,610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "the great advantage is the durability of the fences," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and women, it's not going." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "also for Peter Weiß asserted:" "" "the best food is produced here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Care Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg permits the state support of pasture fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The objective is to open the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The prerequisite is the existence of a material that has been designated by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the area to be fenced must not be tiltable (slope over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">At the moment, eight participants with 24 parcels, who want to build just 16 kilometres of fence, are currently running for the Fisherman's "Fisherman" project in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="96">The disclosure area is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing holy anymore?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans consider them as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firm's Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the pump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN on the proposals of the President for the drastic reduction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller wasn't attacking the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty-Imiteers would have caught him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he took on its meaning, and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "when Miller Acosta complained," "" "I don't want to go down here for a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world." ""</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem you refer to is added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is properly correct, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary response to the shaking words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your tired, your poor, and your oppressed masses, who long to breathe freely, / the wretched garbage of your rich shores."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable waste" "" "on our screens was better to see." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trump USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the meaning of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict of the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - were very well aware that they had accomplished a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was to show the connections between French and American republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a worn classic depiction.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a quite different name: mother of the Exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The link of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus used to change the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a type of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone, but rather an early Neoconservatism, bringing the American flame to the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is moving ahead.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not illuminate the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual, Limbaugh has come across something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite and at all a question of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen from exhausted, eleventh, but hopeful people after long and often terrible travels on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and have a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not enlighten the way, but the hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the UK team</seg>
<seg id="130">The performance director of the UK's athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the world championship kader will make a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, starting on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">"" "black believes that" "" "in Scotland something special is developed" "" "and the athletics of the UK must learn something from it." ""</seg>

<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butsch - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "Eilidh is quite modest." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">Their captain's speech was incredible, "Black says.</seg>
<seg id="142">"" "" "" "a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated." ""</seg>
<seg id="143">"" "the passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought in naturally were great." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete in their fifth World Championships at the 400-m hurdles, says that it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The Central spreader Muir leads along this path and has set up five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman who was supposed to watch for a great season that included victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other Scotsman was Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain says she is "enormously proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also be involved in medals and finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"being so special about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my team-mates voted for me and elected me makes it something very special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"" "" "" "obviously I'm very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team." ""</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as well-established athletes, athletes, who want to climb to podiums.</seg>
<seg id="155">What is my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>

<seg id="160">Blocking critics on Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you can't tolerate the dial-up of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of a bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not last long until the newspapers beat him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He dabbled in criticism, certainly.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "because in 1783 Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute, we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And that's why the American Civil Liberties Union sued him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The governor's staff dismissed the suit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "" "" "it's just Facebook," "" "said many people." ""</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state, which is astonishingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest agreement of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very clever to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to debutt his hair-less head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of persons coming to the Governor's side - which is a public forum which is considered officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the Governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too simple to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post office talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," "" "she wrote in the commentary area of the news broadcast" "" "The Post." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I also don't like this idea, if a number of people take a stand on the same subject, they are ignored by some rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what the governor's staff described as a" "" "concentrated spam attack" "" "would probably call others" "" "intercession" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times when one had done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest and silence protestors.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what's happening digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this issue was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned a voter from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit to the ACLU due to his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of an affordable porto had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers was multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and an anonymous pen hit the lead.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius," wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions, which criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, the trade and shipping with Great Britain, overcame his office, according to the historical documents collected by the Online Papers of the George Washington Project.</seg>

<seg id="421">Electro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk likes to deal with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3."</seg>
<seg id="422">He has hitherto underestimated that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.</seg>
<seg id="423">In addition to the increasingly triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla boss Elon Musk has for the first time revealed another, less dazzling number when announcing the latest quarterly balance: the cancellations made in the new mass market model 3.</seg>
<seg id="424">Over the past few months, Musk has often had more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery is just starting.</seg>
<seg id="425">Now Musk admits: 63,000 had been withdrawn from the total of 518,000 orders.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is merely non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">In the event of a cancellation, Tesla pays the 1000 Euro (in the US $1000 USD and in the UK 1000 pounds) "reservation payment" completely.</seg>
<seg id="428">Currently, 45,000 of such non-binding reservations pretend that Musk cleaned up in a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">However, the Tesla boss doesn't believe that the cancellation of up to twelve percent of all orders could become a problem.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not on demand, but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">In 2018, all models will be taken together - 500,000 to one million by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>

<seg id="440">One day after being sued by 15 states Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce the emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 Years of St. Hilarius-Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, a serenade will be invited to the old cemetery grounds in Tumlingen on Sunday, 16th July, at 4.30pm.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village made the friends and supporters of Tumlingens a matter of their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">"" "Walter Martini points out:" "" "it is a unique village gem." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267, the St. Hilary Chapel was first mentioned in the Württembergischer Lloyd's book: "Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen, including the" Vogbey "at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the certificate according to the document on the Tumlinger Berg, apart from the former parish church, there was also a marvellous farm belonging to which the church or patronage was owned and not the other way around.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Freudenstadt district of 1858, it was beside the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the centre of Tumlingen, the "mountain" the third, the beautiful settlement centre of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the period around 1600 underline these historical facts.</seg>
<seg id="476">The law of patronage arose from early medieval property law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church and filled it with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also bequeath this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">In doing so, the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The greater of the two crushed on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell then rang for the first time in 1692, but had to be released later during the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">During the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) window panes were inserted and the bell parts were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to fall in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Hilarius cemetery was also used as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the church was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the bell tower was standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Eve 1834, a storm split the steeple and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the today still existing tower was preserved as a witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are fostered by Dieter Dockhorn as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">As organiser, the friends and promoters invite Tumlingens to the sixth serenade to the old cemetery of St. Hilary Chapel on Sunday, July 16th, at the sixth serenade.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the Combo of the Kepler High School Freudenstadt and with speeches by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>

<seg id="507">It was unlawful.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheim Nette no wind turbines could have been approved, since at the time in Viersen only at the city border to Schwalmtal a wind power concentration zone existed.</seg>
<seg id="509">Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time, the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy utilisation for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">"" "such zones shall prevent" "" "recess" "" "of the landscape." ""</seg>
<seg id="511">The city of Viersen had decided a second wind-force concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette a few days earlier, but the district government Dusseldorf had not approved, because of a lack of form.</seg>

<seg id="518">However, they do not expect the proceedings to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="519">With regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the contents of the "Boisheim" association's argument in terms of content.</seg>
<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, is planning the construction of four turbines, each 200 metres high, on an area at the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Last year, the company, in which the City of Viersen is involved indirectly, had leased lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65-hectare site.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - roughly one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four-seater households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersen became the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind park near Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind turbine plant in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="548">It was necessary to overcome the lethargy with a network that had spread to some extent, had said it in the spring.</seg>

<seg id="681">Max quantity works as a volunteer</seg>
<seg id="682">They work in their voluntary year at several locations.</seg>
<seg id="683">Where everywhere?</seg>
<seg id="684">Lots: usually in a stone urt in the furniture fair, once a week, I am here in Greven in the furniture bridge.</seg>
<seg id="685">And I also worked at school in an open day.</seg>
<seg id="686">What are your experiences with it?</seg>
<seg id="687">Quantity: it's a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.</seg>
<seg id="688">I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.</seg>
<seg id="689">They are now 26 years, so a late-appointed volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="690">How does that come from?</seg>
<seg id="691">Amount: I did a high school diploma.</seg>
<seg id="692">And then a civil engineering course, let us say, successfully broken off.</seg>
<seg id="693">I realized for myself that it is wrong for me and I want to do something different, working with people.</seg>
<seg id="694">And then I asked myself what do you do.</seg>
<seg id="695">Make a social year, as there is an insight, you can see how it is on site, in the focal point perhaps too, really is.</seg>
<seg id="696">And was it that way?</seg>
<seg id="697">Amount: I collected great impressions.</seg>
<seg id="698">I will start my studies in the social sector during the winter semester.</seg>
<seg id="699">I will study dual, probably do a social worker training in Jugendamt Herne and study in Hamm at the university of applied sciences.</seg>
<seg id="700">Is it not unusual to have several different places during the volunteer service?</seg>
<seg id="701">Quantity: yes, it is very variable.</seg>
<seg id="702">It always depends where you make your FSJ.</seg>
<seg id="703">It can be done from antiquity to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.</seg>
<seg id="704">With me it was very varied.</seg>
<seg id="705">I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon care.</seg>
<seg id="706">For me it was just the right thing that irritated me.</seg>
<seg id="707">I was able to see my own strengths and see how it really runs out.</seg>
<seg id="708">In other words than in civil engineering?</seg>
<seg id="709">A lot: well, here it's not about counting stamps.</seg>
<seg id="710">One always has other people upside down, each of them has a completely different story behind them.</seg>
<seg id="711">Whether a refugee, whether a youth who has been taken out of the family - you always have to respond to it individually.</seg>
<seg id="712">Very interesting.</seg>
<seg id="713">And you didn't have reservations?</seg>
<seg id="714">Quantity: for this I am not the type.</seg>
<seg id="715">It is an area that gives a lot.</seg>
<seg id="716">A lot of love, lots of kindness.</seg>

<seg id="719">The British educational group Pearson said on Friday that they will dismantle further 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent, since another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure the company faces.</seg>
<seg id="720">The job reduction, the CEO John Fallon, mainly announced for the end of 2018 and early 2019, is in addition to his previous restructuring, in which 4,000 positions have already been lost.</seg>
<seg id="721">Pearson announced in May in a third cost cutting program a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds (USD 394 million) in order to revive a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning.</seg>

<seg id="724">A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed a NATO soldier and injured several others, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="725">Five soldiers and an interpreter have been injured in violation of NATO's statement.</seg>
<seg id="726">According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians died in the suburb of Qaragh.</seg>
<seg id="727">The bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="728">On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="729">NATO's opinion is that the explosion on Thursday evening has happened when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was "attacked" by a "improvised explosive device."</seg>
<seg id="730">The statement states that all injured are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital on the Bagram airfield.</seg>
<seg id="731">Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qaragh is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bagram.</seg>
<seg id="732">According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian fatalities in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% in the capital.</seg>
<seg id="733">At the end of July, a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shiite district of Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="734">The Taliban said they had done this attack.</seg>
<seg id="735">On May 31, a massive bombardment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the deadliest militant attack of the country, since the US-led troops thronged the Taliban from power in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="736">The force underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting military and police in the country.</seg>
<seg id="737">Correspondents say that the suicide bombers in Kabul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, their policies, and especially in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani over the past few weeks.</seg>

<seg id="748">In the end, the decision was clear: with two counterparts, the Municipal Council of Flue Wines decides to establish a common area in the future retirement home.</seg>
<seg id="749">Before the discussion, there is an important information: the purchase contract for the still missing piece of land was signed, reports mayor Bernhard Tjaden.</seg>

<seg id="751">There is a discussion about a common area.</seg>
<seg id="752">One of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community.</seg>
<seg id="753">On the ground floor, it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square meters for a special price.</seg>
<seg id="754">The administration and the majority of the municipal council propose that such a common space is not to be seen as a meeting place only for the residents of the elderly, but openly into the congregation.</seg>
<seg id="755">"" "as an example, the word" "" "strikcafé" "" "made the round." ""</seg>
<seg id="756">"" "" "" "the decision made by the provision of funds for the ongoing household has already been decided last autumn by means of grants." ""</seg>
<seg id="757">The building is in the renovation area.</seg>
<seg id="758">The establishment of a common room would be as reported as Tjaden, with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible.</seg>
<seg id="759">The proposed resolution is to signal the investor that in this regard there is no billet between legs, the conclusion that both semitrailers - what is leaning against the surrounding environment - as well as a desk roof - which would reduce the lift height and make the construction more economical - would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="760">Needless to say, not only Wilfried Sohmer means this addition.</seg>
<seg id="761">When it helps it: it happens in tune with the body.</seg>
<seg id="762">It's not as easy as the common room.</seg>
<seg id="763">Daniela's reputation refers to the many own buildings with which one does not go so well, but now they lean in the common room out of the window, she says: "I do so badly with it."</seg>
<seg id="764">Yvonne Staiger is necessarily speaking for the common area - but absolutely against a community involvement.</seg>
<seg id="765">It sees behind it a hidden subsidy to the already wealthy or even foreign investors.</seg>
<seg id="766">This is not the case, because with the acquisition of the surface there is no subsidy, but I get a genuine counter-value that is marketable in case of doubt, is the counter-speech.</seg>
<seg id="767">Staigner's request to adhere to the proposed amendment finds three proponents.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the Finance rules of football affect Neymar's move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending on European football clubs will not interfere with Neymars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain of the UEFA, as the guiding organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair-Play rules launched by the UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG has to prove at some point that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to extract the Brazilians from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary which will amount to several ten million dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make the money loose for Neymar to sign and transfer him to a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but have to deal with legitimate income sources that allow them to even point the break-even point in their football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who had taken huge amounts of debt in their pursuit of success, effectively cheated and risked to ruin if banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP relocated from the concentration on the debt of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, which originally used Roman Abramovich in 2003 in Chelsea, bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder issue.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP publishing period, which runs until 2018, clubs can take losses amounting to EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">Even though Platini 2015 has fallen away from the Presidency of the Presidency, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to be deterred by excessive expenses.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"surely FFP is not dead and we will continue to strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the Buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for invoicing over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar signed a five-year contract so that the selling price for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 44.4 million euros in the financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then 82 million dollars), which later fell to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their income through companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring exceeds the standard market rates, UEFA would not be considered legitimate revenues.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This is exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of sponsoring the PSA was raised by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that a part of Neymar's PSG payments could come to Qatar on payments from the World Cup 2022 World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 agreed that Neymar's World Championship will be ambassador and such a manoeuvre for the UEFA regulators could be easy to find out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"" "" "" "the previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive to pay attention to any attempt to circumvent the rules." ""</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preliminary discussions with PSG about Neymars Transfer, announcing on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They talked about the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG generated a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last financial year still have to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG anticipates that Neymar's arrival is a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and jersey sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and she tried to prevent Neymar's move by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"" "" "" "it is a clear case of" "" "financial doping" "" "with the club and the state," "" "said the President of the La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar's last ownership of PSG." ""</seg>

<seg id="1168">But more important is the advertising effect: it is a prestigious order for a chocolate manufacturer.</seg>
<seg id="1169">The Swiss doesn't want to betray how many applicants are in the new call for tenders.</seg>
<seg id="1170">But only Swiss manufacturers are in question.</seg>

<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.</seg>

<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The lovely Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Romanautor, has never forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there's another crazy evil plot included in the Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-done impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, the exams are the best part of franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It is a lot of fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, showing Matt Dillons's sublippage of "singles," his former big man-on-camp Andy is now feeling like an old cracker.</seg>
<seg id="1197">These are the moments of random delusions that could heat this franchise as a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until it reaches what I consider as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose final scene will show the band the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon reminds us of a different kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-West ring combat iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy with Rhys Thomas, created by Brian Gatevood and Alessandro Tanaka: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici, whose dialogues are synchronised by Channing Tatum (also a detailed producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It's a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it is not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice gags to watch (the police spends time looking at chess on television, as Americans may do with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of famous actors - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and ChloÃ e Sevigny - provides a decent game 'Finde the voice'.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single.</seg>
<seg id="1206">There are six long episodes, and the comedy is not fast or often enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"comrade Detective," which was edited on a lower length, could better deliver his agitprop satire, as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a heap of hamburgers.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, declined in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne says.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I looked for something comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with her and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot of the apartment has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to enter the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"" "" "" "I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light." ""</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill to use 12,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the requirement.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend down." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">It was not only about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below. "</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement made it possible for Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper lighting window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to let it work for a longer time.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all seating and jars made by Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchen is nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering art went into it," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it's important, so that when you push the door, it glides very easily." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage, Joanne could gain an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to increase the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you don't love the electrical outlets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">"" "these are important, but they do not play with your heart." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself by a good design and increased square meter of some standard to something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fighting for a $500 million real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty in a dispute over one of Victorias's largest real estate empire worth over 500 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton football club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp conflict on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars, since the family bought a shop at Smith Street, Collingwood in 1973.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There the family founded Westco jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for $85 million in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis's portfolio now includes offices in the city center, Brunswick and Sorrento's development areas, the Gold Coast apartments and Mt Buller and shopping malls in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">After an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - Paul was described as the "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about a third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court record states that this means that Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "the divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," "" "he wrote in a first affirmative in 2015." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers now also struggle to control the existing business - which Colin, as Paul claims, excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but throws Paul to incompetently manage some possessions.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early case submitted by Colin he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "my Italian heritage prescribes that the family is the most important priority," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs rise in the event, with hundreds of pages with affiridavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and from both parties law firms.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first jean shop of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass their property on to their sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"" "" "" "Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," "" "she wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of De Lutis Group, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid 10 million dollars and $26 million when leaving the company.</seg>
<seg id="1379">"" "both Luke and Mark are," "" "Paul says," "" "the conditions of their financial division have become bitter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin withheld himself very much, although he was a former AFL member and after a biography of 2015 by Eddie McGuire, Eddie McGuire was the best friend of the TV star.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"" "only Colin responded by SMS to say" "" "I can't say much," "" "because the case was before the courts." ""</seg>
<seg id="1383">"" "" "" "it is very, very sad that my brother Paul chose to sue me and to pass our surname through the courts," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>

<seg id="1388">New Chief of Staff is planning to limit the President's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including the news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with executive employees on his first day of work, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he wanted to repair: poor information coming into the president's hands.</seg>
<seg id="1395">"" "Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame trump by supervising its media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades, and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if candidate Trump was angry with unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were too impressive," "" "said the former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February to Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "at the time, Politico Tara Palmeri wrote that" "" "the key to keeping slingbacks on Twitter habit, according to six ex-election officials, is to ensure that personal media consumption includes a steady stream of praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "but the idea that trumps twitter habit ever" "" "under control" "" "is ridiculous." ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">Maybe these campaign officials know what we don't know about others - that Trumps Tweets would have included even more combustible material without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump did not send.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his employees managed it a few times to keep anger away from him, then their efforts paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented Trump to cause controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try again to present their own agenda by presenting trump material that may promote their views of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - devoted entirely to this story - reported in May about the predilection of advisers to provide dubious information to the president for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldsmith:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with damaged leaks, and to find out where they originate from.</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly this happened at the end of February when someone malevolently accused the President of a printed copy of an article by Gotnews.com, the web site of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a heap of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson is permanently banished from Twitter because of chicane, or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that in the past he has uttered false accusations and revoke it.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "Trump read the article and began to ask employees about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldsmith added that the then Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus and General Secretary of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the paperwork that receives the Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchangeable factors make Kellys's mission very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Most wanted criminals to get mail from Europol</seg>

<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is from the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be opened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof on April 13, 2014, approximately 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and also revenue from the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the fall of 2014, in view of the dramatic increase in numbers of refugees arriving in the county, the hotel building was offered to the district office as a collective accommodation, which provided controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the housing of asylum seekers through the establishment of a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the municipal council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadl's senior mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location, and at that time already spoke of serious interested parties in the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should keep right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, purchased the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">You will find Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.</seg>

<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single construction site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There is still much to do by March.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it's actually a nice place," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>

<seg id="1468">One would not want to position themselves at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an upscale downtown level, Scherer observes.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The Waldhotel Luise, with its approximately 60 rooms, wants to spread wide, explains Scherer.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Both individual vacationers, groups or business people should feel at ease in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="1471">He has already conducted talks with OB Julian Osswald and Director of Tourism Michael Krause, so Scherer.</seg>
<seg id="1472">The city's ideas are identical to those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">Looking at the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to define exactly.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Just under one million euros, he reckons.</seg>
<seg id="1476">The external systems are also brought to the front man, which is already clearly visible.</seg>
<seg id="1477">In a courtyard, a large terrace is created which will be accessible from the restaurant that is open to the public.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia Affair: U.S. Special Representative Announces Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair surrounding U.S. President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have appointed a so-called Grand Jury after a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"" "the panel resumed its work in recent weeks, writing the Wall Street Journal, calling on people familiar with the matter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper saw the move as a sign that Mueller extended and intensified his investigations.</seg>

<seg id="1484">Us secret services have been accusing the Kremlin since a long time, purposefully interfered with in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether there were agreements between the bumps campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The investigations will focus on several men who acted as advisors to the Republicans in the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller was also taking a closer look at his private and business environment.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "written a few weeks ago that the special agent Trump has personally moved into the centre and underscored the allegation whether the President might have hindered the judiciary in the course of the affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">"" "" "" "the main task of Grand Jury is to examine the present evidence in possible crime cases and to decide whether charges should be filed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jury is therefore also referred to as a bill of indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Most of the time, they are turned on when they are larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor's Office to invite people to the criminal enterprise under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN, invitations have already been issued which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement, it was stated in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr., Jared Kushner's counsellors and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former Electoral Candidate Paul Manafort were also talking to them.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the setting show that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he wanted to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on in the end to decide on the charging of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">However, the setting up of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "Russia's history is a total invention," "" "said Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">"" "the theme gives the Democrats a way to" "" "feel good" "" "because they have nothing else to talk about." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that it would not be established against the President.</seg>
<seg id="1508">I have no reason to assume that something has changed, it was said in the explanation.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"" "" "" "because of this rooting, accusations against Trump had become loud, he tried to hinder the judiciary." ""</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "" "" "Comey said in June in front of a Senate Committee, Trump asked him to set up the investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn." ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Following the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special issuer and its employees.</seg>

<seg id="1518">Antarctica: giant iceberg drives in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">In the western Antarctic a gigantic iceberg has loosened from the scarce size of Berlin from the ice shelf.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This was announced by the Bremerhavener Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The colossus of about 1 trillion and 5800 square kilometres is now driving north and will probably need two or three years until it is melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants, which researchers have registered over the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for man from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">According to research information, the extent to which climate change has played a role in the abortion of the iceberg is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1525">But overall there has been a series of unusual collapses in the region for about 30 years, writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this can be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The broken colossus has so far been part of the Larsen-C-Schelven.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Ice shelf floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It therefore continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelven is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">To the north of this ice shelf the balance of waxing and breaking was disturbed several years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete ice shelf is broken down there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is quite a lot to say that the Larsen-C ice shelf is in danger, as the front edge has never been pulled back as far as it is currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice plate is under tension and can disintegrate if a piece breaks off at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Melting glaciers and ice bergs does not increase sea level, as they float on the water and ice cream as much water as it results after melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase sea level, but only to a lesser extent, writes the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI data, the Larsen-C ice shelf is the fourth-largest ice shelf in Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean approximately 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "although it is a natural occurrence and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice plate now comes into a more dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary of British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the widest withdrawal from the beginning of the records," "" "he confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Scientists argued whether the Larsen-C ice shelf will grow back or fall back in the long run and possibly fall together, "said his colleague Adrian Luckman, and added:" our models say that it will be less stable. "</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers did not lead the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, however, many of the ice-studs of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart during the last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of the Antarctic stretches in the direction of South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to the research program of the British Antarctic Survey, the ice area of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature has contributed to the decrease.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Over the past 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has been heated by some three degrees and is now counting on the areas where the temperature is the fastest.</seg>

<seg id="1551">Because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vacant jobs, the CDU calls on the employers' association to come out of the employers' association to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Just before the summer break, the circle day broke through 41 new jobs in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 clerks and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>

<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the circle continues to provide personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">At present there are still 50 unoccupied places in the Mettmann district.</seg>

<seg id="1561">"" "according to the parties" "" "wishes of the parties, the administration should" "" "develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is not only to cover short-term needs for skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented competition shortage.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should orient internally and externally, show concrete measures for lateral entrants and include a training campaign, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personal problems that one didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "the speech is of a real" "" "competition of public employers" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">There is a high number of employees who leave the service for disease or age reasons.</seg>

<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the joint application with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He had long been in the circle for a big surprise when he publicly challenged the personnel expenses and baffled the other parties.</seg>

<seg id="1575">Salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level oriented to professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years.</seg>

<seg id="1581">"" "" "" "if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," "" "said Minister of Interior, Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa." ""</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis Warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat of the German relief organisation 'Youth Rettet' because their team had effectively cooperated with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to express a detailed allegation of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>

<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is assumed that its crew takes dinghy migrants aboard, which are delivered to them directly by traffickers, and that smugglers can depart so that ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the file of the prosecutor, whose content was published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The crew is suspected of exposing themselves to the authority of the Italian Coastguard who monitors rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have agreed to keep the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring any "significant changes or obstructions" of their rescue operations.</seg>

<seg id="1599">Three friendly guides were available for this.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour conducted at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">Observation points followed, partly on towers, from which one could look far beyond the Pfälzer Wald and the upstream plains.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there were again and again longer climbs, for the long trivials.</seg>

<seg id="1614">Fact: e-sport has long become a serious business, becoming a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans, and huge guaranteed tourneys.</seg>
<seg id="1615">The first federal ligades have also recognized this, which are becoming increasingly involved in this area.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later followed by the FC Schalke 04 and recently the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sports division in mid-July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.</seg>

<seg id="1622">The Ex-Trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises on an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"real football has to deal with 14-30-year-olds in particular that young people will still go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="1624">And: the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian ones.</seg>
<seg id="1625">With prominent e-sportsmen under contract you could be more often present on these markets online much more than once a year to send the Bundesliga to Asia.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is this all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">During the E-Sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or the FIFA World Cup simulation are fought at competitive level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">As in normal sports, leagues have long since established themselves in which the pros compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And for the Asian Games, E-Sport is already part of the official programme.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it really a kind of sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the performance is certainly getting used to getting used to it.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobber has also talked about the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical responses that can also be found in classical sports such as elevated heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">It also requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction to reaction.</seg>

<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon monoxide intoxication found in a vehicle.</seg>

<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is due to the drought tolerating conditions and insect-transmitting insects, leading scientists and farmers trying to find solutions, causing great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "lavender in Provence is at risk because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change over the past few years, which has brought much less rain in spring and much more in autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the life of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">"" "there is also a small zikade, a microbacterium that transmits the dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather, there are many of them." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the Weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what feels more secure: they are supposed to take their children to the office, which in 2009 were the target of an attack with grenades, or leave them home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the payroll of government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest from violence, and while the bodies are accumulating throughout the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto resigned in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her editor and her inspirer of Riodolce, co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," "" "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books about violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep, although his presence is present everywhere - a great photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hangs on the facade of the Riodolce building. two reporters in the 1930s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts exposing his smiling face with glasses or his typical panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a Sonder Attorney General was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of killings associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodolce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa although they are uncomforting and although the terrain is now more treacherous.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of safety has little use, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know the why, we mistrust all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15 Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodolce in the provincial capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "twelfth river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But there's practically nothing to silence about Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest in the past year and the extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions struggle here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It does not matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of ornate, two-storey mausoleums for drug royals, which are bigger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "rest" when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodolce, was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">At first there was in February the publication of an interview with Damascus Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzmans sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, presumed gathers purchased each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake lay in forcing Valdez, after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story, to leave the country for its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in the establishment of Riodolce and sold 50 US dollar holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the drug-toxin problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to be able to publish very accurate investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of Riodolce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors Cabot Prize" for her coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever she led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up voluntarily that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ Award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life," "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV." ""</seg>
<seg id="1854">"" "" "" "you have to take over the task that suits you as a journalist - either this or you're playing the dumb." ""</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what did you do in the face of so many dead... why didn't you tell what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodolce team misses Valdez, the fun bird, who was able to curse like a dockworker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">"" "now they ask," "" "Was his love for the routine his calamity?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how best to do her job and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret starting and runways," to move drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1863">"" "" "" "these things were not allowed," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">"" "anger is, the editor of the odolce Andres Villarreal said that" "" "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then things are happening with Javier." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the space where the employees of Riodolce met for safety training, no mobile phones suddenly were allowed. days earlier, it became known that Spyware, which is exclusively sold to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-size neighbourhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some reporters wondered whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the policemen who the governor was not trusted.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodolce recorded three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was assassination of the brother of the former famous speaker Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state expenditures, which concentrated on the home town of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the Prosecutor, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels almost the whole century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of corruption due to high-caliber cases.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous events in this locale, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.</seg>

<seg id="1885">"" "" "" "now all channels of communication are broken with our sources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office was devoted to the storage space for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they never expected: activists on behalf of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few signs and the next morning went to a demonstration for another journalist on the prosecutor's office.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>

<seg id="1890">"" "journalists all over the country have become louder by writing in organised protests" "" "SOS Press" "" "on walkways and constructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accuses the authorities to spy on journalists and kill them because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since asked her to be re-divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez said repeatedly that journalists in Mexico were "surrounded by organised crime, government officials and an indifferent society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces that were hiding under a blanket with organised crime.</seg>

<seg id="1931">He met something that was out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.</seg>

<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-shading, a common defence method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the shading is common, the results are surprising since the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that dinosaurs were hunted by enough pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most of the contemporary animals that use the counter-shading - think of deer, zebras or shingles - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot, indicating that this Nodosaurier was a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "" "" "strong predator behaviour on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs must have been the predators of the crayon," "" "said Brown." ""</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to investigate the animal for clues about life, including its conserved intestinal content, to find out what it has eaten as its last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, fell into a river and was pushed into the sea, where he sank on his back to the bottom of the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Floria today, and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much further inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this nocdosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved, flaky skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," Brown MEP said.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"" "" "" "the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early Cretaceous period." ""</seg>
<seg id="1954">You do not need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you only use a little with your eyes, you might almost believe that he is asleep. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The Cretaceous Period was a time when huge Theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs, crossed the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was drowned after death in the sea and mumified in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he digged in the Suncor Millenium Mine on March 21, 2011 near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the best preserved ardinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips protruding from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores were swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater hull of the dinosaur kept its armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remnants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the front branches still cover bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a win in the Lotto.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I approach it, the more confusing it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="1968">The petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">His right forefoot is at his side, his five fingers are spread upwards.</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales on his sole. "</seg>

<seg id="1974">On the motorway Stuttgart-Munich (A8), about 20 people were injured during a mass arambolage on Thursday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="1975">According to the first information of the police, around 17.00 o'clock between the interconnections between Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Landkreis Aichach-Friedberg), nearly 30 vehicles, including trucks, crashed into each other during a thunderstorm.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The exact number of injured parties did not initially provide any information.</seg>
<seg id="1977">"" "" "" "it is a matter of mild to moderate injuries," "" "said a police spokesman." ""</seg>

<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced: there is nothing reminding you on the train and sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or one is deepened into his work and has just a brilliant thought.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: buffalo.</seg>

<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are soon over.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket control.</seg>

<seg id="1999">To be able to use them, however, some requirements have to be fulfilled: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - what most passengers do anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2001">It also has to be purchased via the web app that DB Navigator was purchased, which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last but not least, you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: you get into the train, call your ticket to "My Tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2004">A button for electronic devaluation appears at the test customers.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the reserved seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">When the train driver arrives at the ticket inspection at PLAY, he knows that there is a passenger with an already paid online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">You can continue to sleep, work on, keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the rail - which in turn should take advantage of the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"" "" "" "if you want to travel without ticket control by our train attendant, simply check out in the DB Navigator." ""</seg>

<seg id="2013">Because often you have, in any case, one of the fellow travelers does not have all the documents you need for devaluation of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the identity card is missing or a document that you have to show.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passenger, which leads to bad mood in the part or large room and delays in controlling one's own tickets and the conductor at the end takes time to take care of other concerns.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And that's only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>

<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Only one day after she arrived in New York City, the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled upon a post by someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," he said there.</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused, since nobody else had posted the information in their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was constantly saved on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rapper from the area of St. Louis was about to tweeten the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretching out on the street and remaining there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"" "" "" "that's wild," "" "thought Ferrell." ""</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new to them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She stopped her cell phone to return to Tweets later in the evening over people on the Canfield-Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police band and people who cried, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father who had a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed in which a policeman was standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"" "in another video, she said, another policeman asked his gun and cried," "" "I'll kill you... animals all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"" "" "" "it's not common," "" "Ferrell remembered her statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="2035">"" "" "" "this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt shivering.</seg>
<seg id="2037">"" "I was angry and wept." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 o'clock, she fetched her 6 year old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience that exists from the perspective of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell and her daughter, carrying a flower-dress and a matching crown, went to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation that they had "over the black experience and the black condition several times before this morning."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "" "she remembered what she was saying." ""</seg>
<seg id="2044">"" "" "" "we now go to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right." ""</seg>
<seg id="2045">"" "I could not take it with me," "" "said Ferrell later." ""</seg>
<seg id="2046">"" "" "" "what is happening today is a high point of what happened in the past." ""</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and be drawn up in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to liberate ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism, she is no different from the next black female child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"" "I feel I'd give it a bad service to keep them away from it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was on the South Florissant Road, a place against the police authority, which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-prosecution of Officers Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local businessman who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass it on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism totally changed after 9 August," she said, and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, the chair of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It's all coming. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document" what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "a question came into mind:" "" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">"" "as Folayan recently stated in an interview:" "" "we had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked together with the co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around death row inmates.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of Whose Streets? "in the years after Brown's shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks or talks to us. we're talking," Davis said.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "that was the main thing for me, as these people are portrayed, for so I will be represented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to concentrate on Ferr's experience - to show that the movement "is not a messiah leader, but a community that comes together," Folayan said - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result, documents showing "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr's life as she falls in love with her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," Ferrell said and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and the personalization of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">Ferris's story also repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement who have shaped the film "Blacklive Matter" in social media after killing the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 identify themselves as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"" "" "" "black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement as a whole," "" "said Ferrell," "" "and so we are constantly fighting on different fronts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2074">"" "black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "Folayan agreed to note that" "" "the movement is held upright by black women and many black women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">"" "however, it insists that" "" "this is not an affirmative type of action," "" "when Ferrell was selected because of her identity as the heart of the film." ""</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook this energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="2078">"" "" "" "it is no accident, even though it was at the forefront because in a life at these crossings as a black, gay woman stands as much on the deck." ""</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial ties between the church and the police continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "Dream" to "megalomania": TV viewers discuss Bit-Gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people, even though they have not been built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has been dividing the population into proponents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The topic hardly leaves one.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"" "the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page" "" "Volksfreund Bitburg" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2093">While some say a bit gallery: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "no human being" (Siggi Betzen) or simply: "megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the proponents build that a gallery attracts more customers into the city, from which the rest of the shops also profit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Added to this: the gallery is planned precisely on the plot, where the farmers market hall stands where 13 direct marketers are able to offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">At the beginning of the construction work it will end.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery-makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - for the Beda-Platz with possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone rooms: "for many years we have been buying almost weekly in the farmers market hall.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the farm women always very gladly.</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butcher shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to wish that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>

<seg id="2103">"" "especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what's the purpose of buying in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether it's clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I think it's superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is already enough of this in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains to us.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the goods offered there are fresh, is mostly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, stores in a shopping mall are only rented by larger companies, as the rents there are often unsustainable for a retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, specialty shops are almost no longer and that which is left of it will probably disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping centre with a Markthalle doesn't fit together for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">First of all: where should the farmers market hall go during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">"" "the old" "" "Edeka" "" "would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes at some point." ""</seg>

<seg id="2122">But there's no place for a peasant market hall thanks to the crazy many - as I find - meaningless building projects in Bitburg.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are seen - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the cut-outs out of Fort Leavenworth prison, where former intelligence analyst forfeited a 35-year sentence after making diplomatic reports publicly published on the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on August 2 is called A Becoming resemblance (A suitable likeness).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and a pioneering dissident whose condemnation was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">By algorithmic analysis of DNA, which was extracted from Manning and created from the 30 portraits, how someone with these genomic data could look, a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual commentary not only for the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie, in which Manning clearly sits on a driver's seat and carries a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not visit at that time and she could not be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a portrait of DNA.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated muse became an unequal letter of letters, which during the course of two years exchanged several letters.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a comic book "Suppressed Images," illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future where President Chelny would transform judgment and she would be able to personally see the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, leaving Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender forces in order to find new, tweetable ways to keep the rigid divisions that he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery, Manning with her oversized signature (the "i" in her family name is marked with a heart) was an end to the "automatic fragmentation, whose foundation was gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandfold of Cs and Gs and As, is written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific encyclopaedia of the artist), Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how astonishingly similar, at least in biological regards, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with them is that our genome does not care who we are and how open genetic data is for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, stored in a separate room, is a page from the above mentioned comic book.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning how she appears with a hands-on on hands from the discipline barracks of the United States like King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"" "" "" "if they make your speech cold, then they have won." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2151">"" "" "" "so never stop your mouth." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2152">"" "" "" "it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," "" "said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2153">"" "" "" "I still get goosebumps when I talk about it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she had to do it, she will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, from her own genomic simulations, which rally like hordes of protesters.</seg>

<seg id="2159">A country-wide chase is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford who are looking for suspects after a man has been stabbed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago.</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest warrants were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as evidenced by the acts of the District Court of Cook County.</seg>
<seg id="2161">The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau died 26, after several engravings.</seg>
<seg id="2162">A community warning system published by the police authority of Chicago states that the body was discovered on July 27.</seg>

<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that hold and alarm were in the building.</seg>

<seg id="2181">Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it won't take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).</seg>

<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of WADA's schedule to comply with the Code, which describes the criteria for reinstatement RUSADA and recently published on the Organization's website.</seg>

<seg id="2193">In conversation with Russian sales outlet rsport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov gave problems to the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.</seg>

<seg id="2203">The start-ups that will help your company not become the next Uber</seg>
<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your staff at your e-commerce-start-up, but the surveys did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Responses were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="2208">She has called for help from the outside.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new breed of Human Resources start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to address surveys, offer specialist groups and demographic groups, employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases whistleblowers allow to bypass the C-suite executives and contact the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up GLINT, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said they had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap polls and surveys of specific teams, it offers a heat-card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval results - so that you can reboot, why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that they must remain at the top of the workplace culture so that you won't be the next Uber, who has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment where those who have spoken were punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">This wish is a lucrative business opportunity for start-ups such as GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could reach more than $118.7 billion by 2020, following the finance-related Let's Talk Payments website.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, the company helps prevent and discern bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year amid the Uber-fin in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">"" "like GLINT, Convercent can send" "" "pulse" "" "surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas." ""</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And when the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "public opinion condemns regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and CEO of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">If a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee turnover and complaints, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, has appointed Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">In the past, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to prosecute the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now that the company uses Convercent, problems that previously were hidden in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed faster - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair internships.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of experience with employment," "" "said Vitrano, who leads the Risk Management Group from Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to seriously increase ethics, values and employee engagement in 2002, after Arthur Andersen's accounting firm had collapsed due to ethical breaches by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "Social Media came to their right" "" "that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both GLINT and Convercent offer their software as a service and burden the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Cent received $10 million in financing in February by firms like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzers secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and raised its entire financing to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees are expecting more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">High salaries and interesting projects are only stakes in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley.</seg>
<seg id="2241">Employees want to feel that you are accepted and valued, and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company that owns their voices, and that the work you do is worth it, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience on LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors reach yields when their portfolio companies are running well. companies work well when employees are committed and committed.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the third party analytics tools promise to increase commitment and the use of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement is important according to the experts of workplace culture.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the caretaker of a company does not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Indeed, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the shift does not come quickly enough, or not at all, this can culminate disappointment and demotivate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4.000 ideas, you will have to be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen companies who have left too much on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "for if you will not follow staff will ask," "" "Have you really heard me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about this?</seg>
<seg id="2252">"" "and if you don't care, why should I?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now runs monthly sales surveys, was able to initiate actions on the same day if a problem about GLINT is reported so saved.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganise several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">In the case of Ruby Tuesday, the company will always gain new insights into employees, and it hopes that in the long run this will lead to better bonding of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover.</seg>

<seg id="2374">Over the past few months, again and again the future of the racing platform has been contentious - now it's time to go very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Even before the end of the year, the road on which the tourist train runs is to be built.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In order to secure the future of the racing platform in the long term, construction work on the track should begin this year according to the Ministry of Transport.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"with the decision to further order and renovate the route Ilmenau-Rennsteig, the country is committed to this particularly important link for tourism," explained traffic secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry about</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it can't be even crazier in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the area of sex robots comes.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must begin to take her ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people are making fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more often," said Mr Sharkey in the publication of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also adapt his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the robot's eye color to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it becomes more worrying as many robots have the "personalities" who would let a Stepford woman look progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot, for example, makes it possible for its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "Roxxxy Gold has a personality that suits your personality as well as possible," "" "enthuses the website of True Companion." ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day it also has its moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, be fixed on conversation or she can" "" "be in mood" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive feminine features that make allusions to rape when one gets a step on Frigid (called here: reluctant) Farrah is concerned, disturbing one most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website, True Companion Roxxxy was compatible with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxxxy?" "" "it says on the website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their formation and growing refinement point to something Dunceres and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notices its increasing popularity, they still remain on the brink of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what seeps out of the peripheral zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging at a time when the rights of women in the world are threatened in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to sexually assaulted women.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most deterrent aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') is not the graphic images, the worn body and the stochian eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically feasible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their growers want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, to the point when it comes to its "personalities," the robots do not represent real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate or simply walk away from their companion.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no intermediation or background story, nothing that points to independence or anything that could disturb the fantasy of total subjection.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the language of 2017: maid</seg>
<seg id="2424">Lactm high performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense of human dignity</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a truism of the pump era that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate have also split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the USA with advice about how to deal with the horror of choking relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all going to exert ourselves to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of bringing bundles, families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a leftist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful impact.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House anyone whom she knows, including the republican kinship, with whom she had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite peculiarly on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">For the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it is important to me that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the resulting effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we talk of "normalization" and trump, we refer to the spooky possibility that his bibs will not be repelled someday anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is, however, an even worse long-term scenario in which Trump republicans "normalize" the right wing, which suddenly appear as an epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Today I find myself falling from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's hilarious version of the decline - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both in comparison to Trump in fact seem to be one of very mild crimes.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels in the New York park department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need any caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are creepy and the animals twist to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate-sparkling music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines become familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not quite over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss Cottage - the Topic Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not one - but a big roundabout in northern London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, the Central Park-Karusel is still a strange magical experience, since there are two two-year-olds, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-year-olds on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store stood apologetically grievingly, while I was tired of experiencing her credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Guorius with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital</seg>
<seg id="2450">Pistorius has left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year he was hospitalized due to the treatment of cuts on his hand joints, according to which he was reportedly tortured by the prison authorities in one case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Because of murder of the prosecutors, Pistorius was sentenced to a first death sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cab in his home in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder who hid in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius Appell, of which they say they are too lenient.</seg>
<seg id="2456">"" "" "" "the National Prosecution Service said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection may be heard this year." ""</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius is in danger of being punished for 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>

<seg id="2583">While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found at the University of Washington that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to the development of immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna explained that immune cells patrol in the gut in order to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells capable of detaching inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging delicate tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the equilibrium is too far towards inflammation, an inflammatory bowel disease can result.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments we found that a kind of tolerance stimulating immune cell is found in mice that carry a particular bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a kind of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells promoting tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan would tolerate less tolerable, less flammable intestinal milieus, if the same system also affects people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoctoral student, Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan, examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, but it was not accommodated.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference between the intestinal microbiome of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice's intestines were sequenced and found six species of bacteria present in mice with the immune cells, but without them in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they were given L. reuteri and immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri was able to grow in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on immature immune cells isolated by the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as an indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice food, the number of such cells increased by around 50 percent, but when the tryptophan were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan supplements from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "Wir sind Kirche," explained after publication to the Deutsche Presse-Agentur, he acquired an apology from the former Regensburg bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by Georg Ratzinger's 93-year-old brother.</seg>

<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of describing the Catholic Church as the source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal," "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>

<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger," "" "says Hesemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the results of the report report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is the 440-page report published by the Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">In total, 547 Regensburg domes were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s with high plausibility.</seg>
<seg id="2905">The final report said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be said that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially in the case of high emotional appeal, the punishment for the students could be even more intense.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "in contrast to numerous other defendants, in contrast to numerous other defendants, many victims underestimated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in numerous cases, even have positive memories with him in spite of violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Cathedral, Georg Ratzinger, is relieved of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "incidents of violence on protective charms at the Regensburger Domspatzen" "" "is a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>

<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it also appears as cholerist and perfectionist who became more tangible when a domain record didn't bring any top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is in it at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is just once dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the pre-school also occurred outside of its sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">At most it is possible to reproach him, to know it too late or to have taken first references seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the" "" "Domspatzengymnasium" "" "on which it worked was perceived by practically all respondents as" "" "redemption" "", "" "" "heaven" "" "and" "" "better world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">The vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also presents an excellent testimony, "warm-hearted," "popular," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," "competent" and "understanding," as an extremely good-natured teacher, who regularly nourished the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy and "always moved from grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which has already led to rage eruptions.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he didn't just pop up with chairs and cast the keyring on the floor, but also gave ear-figs distributed and too cheeky guys on the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his rescue, however, it has to be said that such educational methods have been widely used in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what actually is in this report, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the pre-school, these are Bagatellen.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it has to do with his reputation and role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just plunged him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">At the Bavarian pope, many who never understood him are still working diligently.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report is relieved by Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In connection with the report, the media reported a great deal about the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger put in the final report any involvement or co-knowledge with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault contends that they have become familiar with the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to talk about it with my father or mother," "" "said an affected person on behalf of the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in clarifying sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral leader who, professionally, would have been a colleague of the perpetrators professionally.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students rate Ratzinger's role in terms of misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questioned student formulated it like this: "in terms of sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely insight and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... even for really absurd, to assume that it was imputed to him... to have a more urgent or clear or even better opening than to their parents, dormitory managers, trust teachers etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one talks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "the report concludes with the clear result:" "" "the fact that pupils and / or their surroundings affected him in advance could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">"" "" "" "as for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is free to speak out of any co-existence." ""</seg>
<seg id="2943">Neither can he be accused of preventing him or having brought him to the announcement.</seg>
<seg id="2944">That is why there is no reason to link up his good name with these vile crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media, much of" "" "excesses" "" "was read at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report" "" "Look away" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in the reporting everything is mixed and mixed up into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violent excuses and somewhere, in the midst of Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is again a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is a clean separation: between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violent excesses as well as, let's say, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report covers incidents from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not a choral director of the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">All the terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were brutally harassed and painted, and suffering from them, were all at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to prevail.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with whom Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got the boys face when they were already on the gymnasium gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on the one hand, as most witnesses emphasize, the topic of" "" "primary school" "" "is taboo." ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be escaped and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "heavenly" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the gymnasium gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline already, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" "" "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, despite violence, even connect positive memories with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">At the most, the accusation remains to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he just started to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was just not working and responsible (so the witness) didn't want to hear anything, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently shut the ears off the conditions?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because even in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out that" "" "in the preschool, the punishment will continue to be practised." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Even in the face of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was that Prüfferfines were banned in Bavaria long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that they happened in a legal grey area, as each of us knows well.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was also difficult for him to estimate where the people affected might be exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limit has been crossed.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he had always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">It was only in 1980 that the fine in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis asserted that it is unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hesemann:" "" "we historians are talking about the" "" "pitfall of anachronism" "", "i.e. the danger of evaluating the past according to present moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is already right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this does not, of course, apply to sexual abuse, which was abhorred at all times, and also not for what was banned in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond that at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">It's all terrible and I'm glad that it will finally work.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time, I must take care of Georg Ratzinger because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishing, in other words, ears and hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then prohibited, he also strictly adhered to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "what picture of his" "" "Regensburger Zeit" "" "was Georg Ratzinger in talks with you for the book" "" "My brother the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject test capital also become a language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, i.e. Pope Benedict XVI, from his perspective, the domesticated cats only played a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I do not mean by no means that he led a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But that must be said once: without this perfectionism, without calling for unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world-class, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candy alone, a rebellious boy is no longer a great singer and can stand before any success, regardless of the area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">As for a person, you have experienced Georg Ratzinger during the talks with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I met Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, foundational, deep-hearted and heartfelt people, of whom one can not imagine that he could also do something for a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I get regular contact with how many former domes still keep contact with him today, 23 years after his retirement, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who did not forgive him until now, that he was once stern to them, are thus clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the cathedral sparrows are grateful to him today that he enriches her life and has brought to them the world of music.</seg>
