28 @-@ year @-@ old chef found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stair@@ way of a local shopping mall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said that he could not imagine anyone who would hurt him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally it went uphill again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the corp@@ se found on Wednesday mor@@ nings in the West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , distributing the medical department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigations are underway .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , informed the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had his dream job as a cook at the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about his death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and our con@@ dol@@ ences are in this heavy time at Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gali@@ cia stated that Frank initially lived in Host@@ els , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Louis Gali@@ cia said he couldn &apos;t imagine anyone who would hurt his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a big heart .
to connect with his family was to cook something for us to prepare dinner , &quot; added Louis Gali@@ cia .
he never wanted to participate in any kind of dispute .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the stream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ cut diamond that lit brigh@@ tly every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information about the case is asked to call the post@@ code phone number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I will always be put in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
the Hollywood star has now made it unmistak@@ ably clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always stuck in drawers or bon@@ ded from the outside label , which with me and the reality usually have little to do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself do not have the desire to be always perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; frank@@ ly , these things are rather s@@ nu@@ ff for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as explained in the current Cos@@ m@@ opol@@ itan .
most of all , the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , on TV with loose de@@ br@@ is and Mexican food , it is said in the magazine .
&quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; says the Hollywood star .
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; Ani@@ ston appears as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs with us starting on August 25 .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger gets the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger and some colleagues visited a bit of variety with a ride on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden pyramid of sport &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their evening , they drove home to the feed @-@ trou@@ ghs in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p home .
a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and so the riding career ended up again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament wins - was again close to horses .
he had his family run over the plant of the AL@@ RV on a horse he didn &apos;t even bo@@ ar for photography .
this was the first time in Aachen , and therefore also at the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
in the course of a small gala , the German sports team presented the Golden Gymn@@ as@@ tics pyramid to the man from An@@ hausen .
there is no lack of awards for the li@@ ke@@ able ath@@ lete .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silver Lau@@ rel leaf , Champions Tour @-@ Player of the Year ...
even the British Queen had already ad@@ jour@@ ned him .
long is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid .
on Saturday he met the first prize @-@ winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler in Aachen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for it is awarded not only for sporting success but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger has been supporting the offspring .
and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros at the same time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the double US master winner was added to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the gymn@@ ast of Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Reu@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the jum@@ per Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um der Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company immig@@ rated to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza prize went .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tr@@ umps Economic Policy Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent the T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential candidates are not one of the tax and energy policies as well as in a fundamental issue .
the difference in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophical difference .
who , on the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns against how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will drive down regulations massi@@ vely , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has to fulfil certain tasks , it has to offer dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money .
that is why the taxes for the rich would be increased , &quot; she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which must be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost wor@@ dless . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the democratic applicant is even announ@@ cing the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the state @-@ critical te@@ ap@@ y wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so on Tr@@ ump there could be internal discussions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive coal mining in the US again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , the Par@@ isian climate protection agreement he wants to quit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to explicitly expand the renewable energy with its investment program and demands : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far apart from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ ent trade agreement , do not want to sign either .
at the same time , both the US and the US do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - they simply want to better protect American jobs .
they should also be paid better , for example Clinton asks .
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a wage of star@@ vation .
he wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do on this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must go up , then he says he must not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand is Tr@@ ump , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics ha@@ unt him so that the budget deficit would be even greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least from the rich , wants them to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is almost part of everyday life for women who are fle@@ eing themselves .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house is a refuge .
there are four women sitting in a large kitchen .
each has a baby at most one year old .
one has put her little son in his arm .
he looks curious in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until one talks to Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the business director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor of social aid offers in Bavaria , and among other things she deals with the issue of women fle@@ eing .
the four women in the kitchen are refugees .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentr@@ alized accommodations for all @-@ ing@@ ed women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs performed the facility together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Münchner Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
it has been officially opened recently .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - not even as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has had experience with sexual violence on her flight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them as hope @-@ carriers to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in women , other reasons for the escape predomin@@ ate : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly , because they see no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have experienced sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , murder , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this drives them away .
on the escape , that goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believes that the end as soon as they come to Germany , Irish , tells B@@ ahr .
here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered inferior and ab@@ used at worst .
this means that about 90 percent of women who live in the Munich north are trau@@ mati@@ zed , they appreciate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not given up voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are used to saying nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they do not dare to talk openly about what they have experienced , because shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since she often doesn &apos;t know how to help her , she needs more accommodation just for her , asks B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven District Govern@@ ments are responsible for the housing of refugees .
on the question whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their sphere of competence , some answer with no .
in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia there is no such thing in accommodations of governments .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone fled women are not accommodated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Middle Fran@@ con@@ ia there are stor@@ eys or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodation exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; committee in the European Parliament is also calling for women to be shel@@ tered separately from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women should be shel@@ tered separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of privacy or will men and women stay together , it can - continually - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women , is included in the study .
how much women feel this need of protection can be seen at the rush that is available on the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since she has been around for us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily open a second house .
assistant doctors strike : demands for new work instructions
assistant to the Assistant Doc@@ tors have called upon their union to appro@@ ve new actions for action in their disputes regarding a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more actions from the beginning of September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the J@@ DC stated that ministers would have agreed to deal with the concerns regarding the treaty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in July , assistance doctors and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in favour of the elections .
in a letter to the members , who was published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; persist@@ ently calm &quot; to problems , which led to the rejection of the Treaty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Board has voted to completely reject the proposed new contract and call for official new negotiations on all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board today issued a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to authori@@ ze a running programme of escal@@ ating labor actions starting at the beginning of September .
the disputes led to the six @-@ day general strike of assistance doctors , the first overall out@@ ages in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the Federal Environment Minister , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , res@@ ig@@ ned after the election for the rejection of the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the sessions that took place prior to the vote by 5@@ 4,000 resident doctors and medical students that the contract was to be beneficial and should be adopted .
after the vote , the Health Minister Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the Treaty for Doc@@ tors in England would forci@@ bly be introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end to the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes receipt of his Turkish counter@@ parts in the gil@@ ded hall of the St. Petersburg palace , I cannot deny that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
there was a hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile appeared narrow@@ ly and barely spark@@ ed heat , even for his restra@@ ined relations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved as if something bad had never happened .
to me his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radiant , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had not forgotten anything .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the shot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was we@@ ary .
Putin den@@ ounced and accused Ankara of having fallen into the back of Russia .
the off@@ ence was even greater , as it was done by a put@@ ative friend .
building the ve@@ to again becomes difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media led to a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
the most serious were the accus@@ ations made by senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has v@@ ehem@@ ently denied this .
but in St. Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward .
after all , this meeting was held only because Putin was ap@@ ologi@@ zing to President Erdo@@ gan that he wanted to hear .
Russia was able to book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan mainly needs all the friends he can get after he has been reli@@ eved of his ministry last month with a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights , which usually bring millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , travel operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late seasonal attack on the Mediterranean .
this week , the state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian imports are again allowed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ nag@@ sti phr@@ ased it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there , tomatoes here long &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious at the West as it considers its reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak response .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , the sustained res@@ ent@@ ment on the sn@@ ail of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara for claiming that he demanded support for the elected government organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , a matter of course , which itself has a deep fear of regime change .
the summit in this splendid palace on the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to show how an analy@@ st once described me to &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries that feel ill @-@ treated and badly treated by the West and now unite .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played a role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks both pres@@ idents met at the press conference that they hadn &apos;t even touched the subject .
the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences while Putin opted to emphas@@ ise this .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey ki@@ cked off the Russian military jet - it is certainly better that the two He@@ ads of State at least talk to each other at least .
Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for customers outside of Scotland
according to the Bank &apos;s head of office , the R@@ BS brand shall only be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
the Bank has since then dis@@ soci@@ ated itself when it had to be collap@@ sed almost collap@@ sed eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used to protect other end @-@ consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ing , from Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to focus more on national brands .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all the RS@@ B references , the decentr@@ alised head office and the listing of stock exchange take place at Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for private client business that are more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour by customers and staff in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand becomes our Invest@@ ors brand and the brand under which our employees will be busy as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I now say that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in its sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it is time for us to become a bank of brands , because how do we concentrate inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the CEO .
three years ago it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands .
but with our work , focusing on customer needs and not our own , I think , one will see many changes .
we can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come .

the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday .
he put a milestone on his local race track on his local race track with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey , reaching a milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the triple winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won in front of G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I ended up here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori cap@@ tures the che@@ er when he makes the victory on Pre@@ dile@@ ction
two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle course - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ ist had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career successes
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey players of Moder@@ nis@@ m and it is no surprise that he achieved this milestone , which only a few met before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma enthusiastic fans for years for this sport .
I told Frank@@ ie some weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already won 6,000 winn@@ ings if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie has already ger@@ min@@ ated for nearly 30 years in the UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the fi@@ gu@@ re@@ head of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a number of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in As@@ cot in 1996 , but he also survived an airplane crash and received a ban on drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three years ago , he had difficulty at the beginning when he returned from his six @-@ month barri@@ ster , but showed an impressive character to def@@ y his doubts and to return to his form .
and he hasn &apos;t come to the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori said earlier that he wants to continue in competitions up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of age .

born in the Est@@ onian capital of Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow International Relations Institute ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy .
on the website of the Krem@@ lin it is ( in Russian ) that he later was the cler@@ k and chief of staff of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s the government &apos;s most important task to support your work as head of state in respect of bills of legislation and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov was asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
do the smiling faces convince ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was one of the closest friends Vladimir Putin for a long time and worked as he did for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ ig@@ ned at his own request .
but despite the ridi@@ cu@@ le for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
is this the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows that at the moment .
but the official statement - that a man who once was tou@@ ted as a potential president would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin , quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said : &quot; it is true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , this very complicated post - one could almost say - tru@@ sting posts for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V participated in the post in December 2011 .
before that , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and , like Putin , a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted the most .
it was once assumed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia , since a third term of office would have viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another closest associate , Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before becoming president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination of the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , who produce the series , announced their termination in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the special agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his termination .
on the set there were artistic differences and differences of opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the character Gib@@ son from the series , which is followed by a team of F@@ BI agents , is expected to be released at a later stage , according to the opinion of ABC studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com D@@ har@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been with us since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and have put my whole heart &apos;s blood in the last twelve years , &quot; said Gib@@ son in a communication released on Friday .
I hoped to be there until the end , but that will not be possible .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans , who can only wish for a series .
the scheduled broadcast of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 .
ri@@ dd@@ les around fish landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
an inhabit@@ ant of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks it could be about the 75 fish around Sand@@ a@@ ale that were picked out by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives at about 500 meters from the sea , released a video of the spectacle on Per@@ is@@ cope hoping that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
crossing the bridge now with Fi@@ fe
the project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
engineers have connected the North deck of the Que@@ ens@@ bus cross@@ ings to the vi@@ a@@ duct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are approaching completion by each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 hel@@ ical ropes .
the project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to walk from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment when building Que@@ ens@@ ko cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witness@@ ing an engineering skill of a truly epic degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , completion of the connection between the vi@@ a@@ duct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit .
in total , nearly 79 % of the deck de@@ cks are in place and the last section of the deck is getting a g@@ ong for the deck in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first seal represents a significant milestone for every bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this fantastic project , the closure represents future @-@ oriented high and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection to the north tur@@ ret deck , we had to close the existing gap on the north or the shore .
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ meters to the south .
this was a massive and at the same time very sensitive activity .
massive because the vi@@ a@@ duct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs about 6.000 tons and had to be pulled up at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % .
un@@ cles , because the toler@@ ances on which the team worked were tiny - on each side they were just a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men are lucky enough to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after being tos@@ sed by their fishing boat before Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station sounded the alarm at 13 : 20 BS@@ T on Friday after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had trouble swimming while their boat moved from their own power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat turning around and presented the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds ble@@ w the boat out of its reach , until we left it , &quot; he added .
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found hanging on a bu@@ o@@ y without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have been un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the boat engine had an emergency stop , the boat was loos@@ ened by the person who controlled the boat .
someone has wo@@ ken up today about these men .

who build cheap apartments in Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens mean that investors should be put into the duty much more strongly in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig loses nearly 1,@@ 300 inexpensive homes in the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; action concept for housing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the argument is programmed .
first and foremost , the question is : who should build the cheap apartments ?
so far , a regulation is missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : those who want to build on urban areas must in future show 20 percent of all homes as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the cheap apartments can also be built on stock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big issue in the town hall is , however , Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new urban housing development programme , which will cost millions and still has to be financed , should provide incentives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , says Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make as few rules as possible to investors .
the left still wants tough@@ er conditions for investors .
despite this , Brat@@ mann says , there is an intensi@@ fication of the situation in the housing market .
if the concept of action is implemented , this will take care of additional tasks in the construction management .
more staff is needed .
it is not clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the program is not complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how do you compare the loss of other around 1300 budget apartments , whose funding will exp@@ ire in the next few years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , the political spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm , should now be bought out of the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought of bringing homes back to the price fixing .
this is possible in the West@@ stadt .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
because in the West@@ stadt , Fri@@ sten exp@@ ires at the end of the year .
around 1800 flats you could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
but the owners , the housing associations do not want this .
because the number of social housing in the west city is dramatically increased , the aim of the so @-@ called mess is to be removed .
there should be no more concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although I focused on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise can not yet be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it
it is fascinating to see how the world is changing .
that teenagers and children are no longer going to play outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time star@@ ing on screens , has been lam@@ ented by many in the last decade .
at Pok@@ emon Go , it &apos;s about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially on the TV , then limited to video games and last on smartphones .
so it &apos;s great to see technology and outdoor activities not mutually exclusive .
it goes without saying that I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters created initially for the video games in the 1990s ( later a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
like many pop culture phenomena , interest fell slightly before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July .
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ loaded the servers .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ mons that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found they can be &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the cell phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation who played the game , when she was younger , joined the del@@ usion and jump@@ ed for the search of the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person re@@ stores every day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Car@@ di@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , tracking 3@@ 5.000 users , announced the Washington Post recently that within two days of the launch of the game , the number of subsequent people who train every day 30 minutes jump@@ ed from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely sees the raw data on the increase in performance .
many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to take 30 minutes of &quot; coming from the sofa &quot; and &quot; being active every day &quot; hit deaf ears because many public messages are boring for health and come from people who look mis@@ erable .
nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be over@@ rated .
anyone who regularly performs sports reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open , making them fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even join the hunt for new friend@@ ships .
as always , there are also angry game destro@@ yers , who always have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what is it to do ?
a breakthrough has occurred .
even though Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ bit were already able to track our activity before , they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will dimin@@ ish with time .
however , due to poker &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier .

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es Cre@@ ates Gold in Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget about the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all that .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
st@@ unn@@ ingly on the ground .
brilliant on the whole line .
and now finally Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast ki@@ cked the multi @-@ battle track on Thursday and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
her overall score of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winners and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mates A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alist Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
the American Women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es cont@@ ests on the Swedish bar during the single multi @-@ fight national of women in the art gymn@@ as@@ tics event at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ it is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who gains a multi @-@ fight title and in total the fifth while she soli@@ di@@ fies her call to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who have brought their sports to new heights :
Bal@@ es has dominated the last three years her sport , won 15 world championship med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with such amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Rett@@ on told her that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
she expected a final exam in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered disappointment .
the American act@@ resses Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , on the left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after they have won gold and silver in the single multi @-@ competition women in the gymn@@ as@@ tics event at the 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ a won the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as ex@@ clamation mark at the retirement ceremony of Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i , who retired in retirement .
although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted on never having planned the future , it is not really true .
part of their soil exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tailored to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
this girl who was adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school excursion into the gym , trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , it has not lost any more competition , a series of victories that will last as long as it wishes .
even if Mu@@ staf@@ ina led easily through two turns , the picture was mur@@ ky .
floating beams and ground stars - in which Bil@@ es holds the world championship title - were l@@ ur@@ king .
she recovered again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam - and with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground another one .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently when she expected her end @-@ b@@ nis - a pure form@@ ality - and tears poured on Bil@@ es bril@@ li@@ antly red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her book book became reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal went to Mu@@ staf@@ ina in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team of men , called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; had a lead . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her practice she threw the audience to K@@ us@@ sh@@ ausen , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as for Bil@@ es , the fast spreading tweet of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a completely new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims shot in mass mur@@ der@@ ings when listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl killed in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix while they stopped in the car and heard music .
Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , said the authorities .
the perpetr@@ ator firing eight shots from a hand fire@@ arm while standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police informed that the triple murder does not seem to have been the result of a pre@@ dat@@ or , as the Att@@ acker didn &apos;t take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , owned by one of the adult victims .
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting had led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they were connected to four previous attacks .
a total of seven people were killed and two others injured in His@@ panic houses within four months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is happening in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is believed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ an from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which was aimed at an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge shells and secured a sphere from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 year old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it gets better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most of the 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and , of course , his mother .
but like most of his elderly , Ed@@ mund Mic@@ zep@@ hal@@ ie , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to did not know during her pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought was , I don &apos;t manage it .
I can &apos;t do that .
I did not let go of that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s not true at all -- of course you have left it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and her have been told that under certain circumstances , Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize them and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer to this was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to explained .
Ed@@ mund is able to walk with the help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund was unable to sit or craw@@ l up to his third year of age and he still cannot speak .
but he is making progress slowly .
it can run with support and cycle rides .
he also loves playing and singing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language Ed@@ mund is saying for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing me something &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we teach him a sign language , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some signs on her own .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a wide range of causes : genetic as well as Ed@@ mund and infection with viruses such as meas@@ les or the ca@@ vor@@ ian virus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and pre@@ dictions can vary greatly .
it &apos;s still too early to say how it will affect the life of the co@@ ca@@ virus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to reminds us of the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what was going to happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t really know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the forecast for a long time , because I didn &apos;t expect someone to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the ci@@ ca@@ virus .
it will be better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rainf@@ all , floo@@ ding cause rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ all and large floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to sum@@ mon the stand on Friday . it is expected to rain on Saturday all Saturday .
numerous rivers in the south @-@ east of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flooded their banks and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service .
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards said that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on their way to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , informed that the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that only the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa would have requested ten thousand sand bags .
a flood warning system is used for large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service announced that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood warning system was used on Friday while still ra@@ ining in the Mobile Region .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , are likely to reach record levels over the weekend .
the meteor@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses nearby Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers are slowly chann@@ elled into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as via the tro@@ dden rivers .
the Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w river , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi national border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.@@ 00 .
rescue teams still recru@@ ited people out of flood water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y H@@ ans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were rescu@@ ed by Glo@@ ster on Friday .
H@@ ans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally located more than 400 feet away from his house , grew up overnight .
he said that another step@@ son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water flow@@ ed and came in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ ans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife told H@@ ans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there .
H@@ ans@@ ford said he and his family members had all disabilities and he was the only one who can swim .
H@@ ans@@ ford said No@@ thel@@ fer had rescu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster where they were station@@ ed until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spread quickly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as there were still severe ra@@ ins and that the authorities were considering evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer mar@@ ched near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil was completely absorbed by ra@@ ins since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy ra@@ ins and floo@@ ding caused the rescu@@ ing of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and school trips in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that an R@@ ank@@ ed in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa attacked 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated to two churches which were both flooded .
the leader of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets washed by the flood .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the evacu@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will be able to go back to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozen roads were closed due to the flood and sand@@ bags were provided for the residents to take part , hoping to be able to keep the water out of their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last major flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to become a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast .
according to his information , a handful of houses on Thursday were reported to have been reported to be flooded , but on Friday , no reports have been reported .
Keith Tow@@ n@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tow@@ n@@ son said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s still coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; perfor@@ ated by bul@@ lets , &quot; fired shooting in Philadelphia
the police tells us that the six @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week the second time a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child was shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents said Brown had suffered several shot injuries , including in the loin , leg , arm and belly , but that he was conscious of his transport to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has gone through a lot , his small body was perfor@@ ated by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his grandmother Del@@ ors Mel@@ ende@@ z shared with the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was deemed critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the transmitter that it is likely to recover .
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people shot at German@@ town .
three men were also shot at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state , according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found at the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical condition , found shot , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ator .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that it apparently had come to a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
cartridge shells for assault rif@@ les , which were tra@@ cked back to various assault rif@@ les , crow@@ ed the scene .
it seems that this is clearly a prolonged struggle .
on the road , on either side of the side@@ walk , there were pulses .
in this way , it seems that there were several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; said police officer Anthony Gin@@ ali@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the station .
several houses and vehicles were also found in the area .
there was no arrest and police reports , according to reports , the surveillance video .
on Tuesday , another 6 year old girl was hit by a cross trainer at the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .
she re@@ covers and the police still searches for a suspect .
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I imagine under the women &apos;s Olympics in Tur@@ ning and that is more than a reason .
first of all , I &apos;ve been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three gymn@@ asts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who have inspired many young girls of other skin colors .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the ca@@ tho@@ lic is round off , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one among female gymn@@ asts was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprise Olympic winner and America che@@ ered .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world championship in Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , how they delivered unexpected , but master@@ ful gy@@ mas@@ tics routines .
on Thursday , Sim@@ one became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who won gold in an individual multi @-@ battle event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but we do not look like gymn@@ as@@ tics across the country .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie struck all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison in order to put it into the Olympic team .
they are the Last Five , because the next Olympic Championship will only have four gymn@@ asts in the team . it is also the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer .
but the reality is that gymn@@ as@@ tics are an expensive sport and gymn@@ asts come primarily in private gymn@@ as@@ tics that are maintained by parents who pay for training , training , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for coaches and their gymn@@ asts and families ) .
the majority of these gymn@@ as@@ tics are in wealthy suburbs that can support business .
in these clubs the Tur@@ ner get their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment for the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained their athletes since they started gymn@@ as@@ tics .
we have to explore the communities of countless young girls inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie to make a more affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ reach turn@@ around .
I founded my turn @-@ over foundation of 20 years .
at my events , we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban you@@ ths ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics that make the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thanks Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the Olympic team golf and thank you for motiv@@ ating so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistant doctors want to organise more strikes after they have rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7,@@ 000@@ ,000 resident doctors who voted in a vote rejected him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in July Hun@@ t had revealed plans to forci@@ bly introduce the Treaty and said that the N@@ HS found itself in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no man &apos;s land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and any further delay for the staff and patients would be harmful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first assistance doctors are expected to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend counter@@ parts in order to improve care at irregular times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , Chair of the BM@@ A Committee for Assistant Amb@@ ass@@ adors , stated last night in a communication : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assistance physicians have serious concerns about the proposed agreement , in particular that it will fuel the current rate of occupation and will admini@@ ster it to treat all physicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with only eight weeks left until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; efforts by the BM@@ A to resolve disputes by talks met with the government for reluct@@ ance and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was the case of a promise made by Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , lift up the vibration and address the worries of the assistant physicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he fails to do so , the assistance physicians have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further training measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 dates , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to provide coverage to doctors on the strip chain .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants a better weekly pay for the 5@@ 4,000 resident doctors who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS employees , called on the assistance doctors to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labor saving measures do not achieve anything but burdens loaded teams and service providers and provide care , emergency and interruption to patients , car@@ ers and their families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months we talked to the Committee of Assist@@ ants and responded positively to the concerns regarding tut@@ el@@ age and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries .
employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training courses , training sessions , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holidays and gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious the employers , health education England and the Ministry of Health were concerned with respect to the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day medicine that can lower heart attack risk
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medicine after endor@@ sed by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti @-@ inflammatory drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the medication is administered after a heart attack for 12 months , reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulation of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls .
if the layer breaks apart , it can cause a blood c@@ lot that c@@ logged the blood flow to the heart , causing a heart attack .
when the blood c@@ lot triggers , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons already having a heart attack are subject to a higher risk to have another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more unlikely .
the draft bill of N@@ ICE , which was published today recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health @-@ Tech evaluation centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack , have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a new heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively assists in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack .
by a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness culture thri@@ ves electoral fraud in Muslim areas
former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man was removed last year due to corruption from office due to corruption
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is know@@ ingly ignored just like a destroying government report today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former cabinet member , Sir Eric Pick@@ les , ur@@ ges the police , election observers and town coun@@ cils to ignore evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former minister of integration and communal government , who is now a antagon@@ ist king , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious reasons would be so bad that the police were allowed to set off barrier tapes outside of electoral cabins to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he recommends that voters should carry out an identification card to prove their identity in elections .
at present , a vot@@ er just has to name its name and address .
the report proposes to apply in@@ deli@@ ble ink to a person &apos;s finger if they give up their vote to prevent someone choosing twice .
whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
he demands that the press should have more access to community documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this serves not only against electoral fraud but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and fiscal fraud culture associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Dow@@ ning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets &apos;s election sc@@ andal in the east of London .
last year , a special electoral court ruled that the inc@@ umbent mayor Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man was to be dismissed after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his office .
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he would silence his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation in which a person was chosen as someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud all over the country .
he was particularly al@@ armed to the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including leading out points to prove the identity
in his report , it says : &quot; as proof it was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exer@@ ted , especially women and young people in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , especially communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there have been concerns that ... state institutions ignor@@ antly ignored such behaviour based on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity concerning eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said fifty recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists edit letter papers to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election harvest &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral directory to be used for immigration and social fraud purposes .
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger once she has left her voice to prevent someone choosing twice .
carry out systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible for selection .
a three @-@ year limitation to requests for an automatic postal code .
prohibition that political activists handle complete brief@@ ings and envel@@ opes of brief@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have the authority to set off barriers to electoral stations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a change in the law that facilit@@ ated an indictment for in@@ timi@@ dation according to the 1983 re@@ pres@@ sions of the People Act 1983 .
prohibition of photograph@@ ing in electoral stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the voting stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training in order to ensure that the employees generally enforce that voters go alone in the cabin .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that there was no criminal complaint after Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the election court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for illegal and illegal practices as un@@ suitable for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check@@ up checks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the election registration departments of the town coun@@ cils . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country is a proud heritage as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and covered spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy after K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of Olympic athletes in Rio
this week , fans of the Rio Olympics in Rio have come out of the border with the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , who has proved to be an impressive double @-@ go@@ er of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic Games is by no means the only ath@@ lete who is fighting for gold this summer , which has its own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not if one is allowed to believe the social media .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ cker at the time on our screens , F@@ email has created lists of Olympi@@ ans that show more than a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the h@@ unter and the wolf : team member of the American team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , on the left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood .
besides K@@ ate &apos;s doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the rac@@ et@@ rack , many people in the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be .
the team member of the American team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison caused a t@@ opping on Twitter after pictures on which he looks like the Wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ cann@@ y .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not see any great simil@@ arity , except the facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good looking guy , so I guess it &apos;s a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focal point : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ jum@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina , with her big expressive eyes , is to be able to go through the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African float Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
one step higher : this user considers that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor
another ongoing comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similarly heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal winner Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mo@@ va shows more than just the sun@@ tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans to equal an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , on the right , have a similar visual form and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities
theory put into space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the pair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US soccer star Hope Solo and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar visual form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons covered Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold med@@ alli@@ sts in Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , who has her own beautiful , wide smile , similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator on the Olympic Games exc@@ uses for his statement that Chinese float &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a pig died &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds Analyse on the fourth place of the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Yan@@ han at dr . 4x@@ 200m Fre@@ estyle squ@@ ad@@ ron sc@@ ared spectators of the C@@ BC live transmission of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ ical Games on Wednesday
Canadian broad@@ caster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese float went off like &quot; C@@ ief , &quot; and during the race as &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off when he had his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m outdoor swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron .
Mac@@ Donald , who was taken board in the C@@ BS &apos;s commentary team to give more &quot; colour , &quot; one could say : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , went as low , died like a pig .
thank you for this .
the Chinese float Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the squ@@ ad@@ ron 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled Canadi@@ ans to close the gap to China .
viewers throughout Canada re@@ acted quickly after they were shocked by the sound and language
Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; Does the C@@ BC comment@@ ator say that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; like a pig died &quot; ? ? ? ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot did not capture that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the final 4 x 200m free @-@ stil@@ ted squ@@ ad@@ ron for women as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the criticism against By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter was swift and hard , with which many addressed him
Twitter users did not keep back when they heard how un@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald was
another Twitter user in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us all look like ra@@ cists . # made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; shortly afterwards Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC programme , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sorry that the comment was broadcast on a swimming performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , we are sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times with the people who responded to the emer@@ gen@@ cies via Twitter
the Com@@ mentary colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about Mac@@ don@@ ald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ olog@@ ised quickly and issued a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was possible to be broadcast .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last night , we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers on the show and our followers in the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the float and not to them as a person .
but they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ happy formulation . By@@ ron is very sorry about what he said .
on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the show and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron in the C@@ BC Olympic event . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I referred to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not to them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was inten@@ tional and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shop@@ pers in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged by women trying sham@@ elessly under@@ wear in the middle of business
the shop@@ pers didn &apos;t know where to go , when a woman pulled her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mar@@ row to try under@@ pants .
to wor@@ sen the situation she looked at her as she looked at it , pulled it off and put it back to the shelf .
she continued to rum@@ mage and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Mall in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark business at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone in which the woman pro@@ mul@@ g@@ ated the under@@ pants before she put her back on the shelf
&quot; &quot; &quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she went back and left the business without buying anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales floor , she picked up a pair of pants from the delivery , pulled out her own ti@@ ghts and pants and tried them .
&quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like as she put her back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , got up and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b someone watching - or thinking about the person who might buy the under@@ pants that she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to think disgu@@ sting that someone would take home under@@ pants that had another person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have seen , the employees have tried to withdraw the garments from selling after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and und@@ ressed her and she wasn &apos;t washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a against weapons attack
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
we talked to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York , to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at a distance .
regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn your k@@ eb@@ ot around for your pre@@ dat@@ or .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when you approach you from behind , you should turn around as first , so that you can see your aggres@@ sor and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go out of the firing line , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
grab the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
strike him with his knee in the bar and twist while the aggres@@ sor cro@@ up against pain , the weapon out of his hands . strike him with the barrel in the face and move backwards while holding the gun on him .
for attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the gun , grab the gun and twist it so that the aggres@@ sor cannot shoot .
shift the weight to the weapon at the same time and beat the attack@@ er on the chest , then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and directing the weapon to it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it pre@@ tends to Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that a rob@@ ber@@ y is the saf@@ est way to transfer your money - unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
travel@@ er Ian W@@ right sch@@ ab@@ t his tongue on Europe &apos;s dir@@ ti@@ est places for a travel guide
a British trav@@ eller under@@ took his immune system and the dice of a serious test by le@@ aking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the present@@ er and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k shifted his course on a Euro ticket , a hand@@ rail at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a sl@@ ur@@ ry button on a train toilet as well as a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before leaving each object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he is going to get involved .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to light .
the thought of le@@ aking the pur@@ ge button of a pull toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe Mr. W@@ right talked with doctors and medical professionals about the encour@@ agement of gut bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately , nothing left what he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in his mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ine by traveling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things .
from public money to train stations to r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ bs of toilets , the immune system definitely put under a test
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film he was able to do justice to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his test line showed a lumin@@ omet@@ ry of more than 4000 units .
in comparison to this , the lum@@ bar number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a r@@ ussi@@ an toilet , which he refused to lick up after their lumin@@ ometric number was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands exhibit one of less than 60 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; showing the bacterial count at different places such as the bathroom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that comes close to the worst that I have sm@@ elled in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dirty than that !
I &apos;m not going to lick here because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vali@@ o Senior Venice President for Snacks , S@@ haf@@ ts and New Categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biotics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we conducted crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended that we said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health will become a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , directing the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I told him to lick , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick it up and others with which it was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad we recorded some of these dirty delicacies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o from 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents in lac@@ tic acid bacteria associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing the included lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
A@@ soci@@ ali family destro@@ ys before del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation of the social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left their home after del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation with a loss of £ 50,000 because it had terr@@ orized their neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls had perfor@@ ated holes , wooden plan@@ ks were torn up , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was s@@ me@@ ared on the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is thought that she is now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who worked for the house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer to be repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider since this property is believed to be regarded as not so beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted on street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive cries , stri@@ kers and cur@@ ses .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name stood on the lease , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
in the property in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden plan@@ ks were torn up
neighbors said they had to fight them on the street and the police had to be called regularly
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing led her and her partner forci@@ bly from the property this week after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said that their lives were made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t care for anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years alongside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this morning we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now that they are finally away , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood Enfor@@ cement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , testified that it would have given the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years .
rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down on the over@@ grown side of the community house
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant agrees to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family because del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation is always the last step into consideration of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be horrible .
I appreciate all the work my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have given us the information .
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbors and the message con@@ veys that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ ading on the floor
workers in property management will now have to evacu@@ ate rub@@ b@@ ish mountains that surround the house
in 2014 , the police launched a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash amounting to £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine after having found himself guilty of a drug of class B in commercial len@@ i@@ ency .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don who died in a car accident in 2013 .
after they were homeless , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many room walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti coated with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say that they will act as ten@@ ants who do not comply with the house rules .
Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall informed us that del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation is a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not comply with the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ reproach and those who have been har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

the Air Force announced that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that no security risk occurred .
this was the moment when frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after an eff@@ er@@ ent jet crashing over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew almost in close proximity to the sun worshi@@ ppers on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers jump@@ ed up when they understand@@ ably began to worry about the noise of the nozzles , without seeing first what came through the clouds to them .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media said : &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Av@@ eiro beach tourists were terri@@ fied when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep
the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and so had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the spokes@@ man said that due to the bad visibility due to the bad visibility of the area , the plane flew slightly deeper than usual , but the air forces insi@@ sted that safety at no time was at risk .
area fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where also four people on Madeira Island came to death .
the Portuguese Air Force today indicated that the pilot had to fly as deep as possible due to the conditions - heavy fog and smoke smoke .
the plane was on a training flight , where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Super@@ cup : bar@@ ca with worries about Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step in the new football season on Sunday .
the Catal@@ ans compete in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup towards FC Sevilla , the re@@ play proceeds three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ W@@ inner must disp@@ ense with the superior cup@@ in@@ alist and reig@@ ning European league champion amongst others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who den@@ ies the Olympic Football tournament in Brazil .
furthermore , Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen is missing .
the German suffered a rec@@ tification in the knee in the training , which clari@@ fied the entry question at Bar@@ ca at least for the time being in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen in Barcelona have been competing for the status as number one for two years .
coach Luis En@@ rique refra@@ ined from making a clear decision in this respect and left Bra@@ vo in the League , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most of the other cont@@ ests took preced@@ ence .
before the first mandatory game of the new season , there is doubt about the fitness condition of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool , with 0 : 4 .
also at 3 : 2 in pro@@ ver@@ al@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. really did not really convince .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sevilla again has the 2 : 3 defeat after extending in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona is the record winner of this competition with eleven achievements so far .
Ma Long in an own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defending champion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the world @-@ ranking @-@ first brought the Golden Grand S@@ lam with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour @-@ Fin@@ al@@ Tournam@@ ent and even Olympia .
bronze went to Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ zu@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the title among themselves .
it was clear that for the third time in a row Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top Olympic @-@ podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the disk , between the sentences and in time @-@ outs , they had no coaches .
they had withdrawn on the grand@@ stand and left their prot@@ ectors on their own in fair competition alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mat@@ ches to here I have played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang had said .
after the game were pos@@ ing gold and silver med@@ alists with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
Ma had to fight with his 28 year old opponent only in the first set .
then he determined the tempo on the record and left Z@@ hang from there only a total of 13 points .
due to the superi@@ ority of Ma did not develop the expected ro@@ using match .
but nevertheless enough stunning ball changes were to be seen nonetheless .
Mi@@ th@@ ani won the bronze game against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quarter @-@ fin@@ als against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an had contracted a ri@@ pp@@ le injury , after that , in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately , &quot; had to settle with sheet metal .
the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) have been in similarly high table tennis @-@ age Olympic Vi@@ erte .
Donald Tr@@ ump cle@@ ars &quot; tremendous problems &quot; in election campaign
the leadership of the US re@@ public@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditionally conservative states to lose their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has now yiel@@ ded weaknesses of his election campaign in the former Republi@@ can High Castle U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire expressed something like concerns about how correspon@@ dents reported .
having thrown 16 ri@@ vals out of the race inside his own Republi@@ can camp , doubts about his success are now growing in the battle for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump in front of evangel@@ ical Christians , asking for support in important states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blame be false reports of his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media rebu@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot;
stir up repub@@ li@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
according to a survey by Surv@@ ey@@ FDA in June , Tr@@ ump and his cur@@ ator were equal to the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutions see Tr@@ ump in the front , but not by the distance common to Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state .
as endangered , Arizona and Georgia are also considered vulnerable .
in an interview by Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump answered the question of how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; exactly as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and whether afterwards : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he doesn &apos;t do anything else than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; telling the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it does not suff@@ ice for him for reasons of political correctness , be that in order , &quot; Tr@@ ump continued to say .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the Tr@@ ump party should have threatened to withdraw funds to support his campaign , he should not be able to present better survey values .
instead , the candidates of the Republi@@ can Party wanted to strengthen the ranks of the congress more strongly .
Olympics : three @-@ poster D@@ oping @-@ Test
the IO@@ C intends to set up a disciplinary commission .
Ken@@ y@@ as athletes face disaster after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics .
after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee decided to promptly set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary informed that the former S@@ printer and present coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine test in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich .
this was reported to the team leader K@@ eni@@ as by the dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF world association has requested the IO@@ C to gather information about the case in order to ex@@ ert own investigation , an IA@@ AF spokes@@ man announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the measures taken by the IO@@ C the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was stated in an IA@@ AF explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the D@@ oping Control station and handed over as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i , handed over the sample and signed it , &quot; stated Ken@@ y@@ as Chef de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the accreditation of the ath@@ lete who was on the list for training controls of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was over 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics delegation leader Michael Rot@@ ich was withdrawn from the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed sport@@ spe@@ ople of his country about pending dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he allegedly was arrested at his return to Nairobi &apos;s airport .
Kenya has been under special observation at the IO@@ C after numerous lo@@ oping off@@ enses .
at the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls put forward by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , an unusual point was noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had put much pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic Games commen@@ ced .
as a result , the WA@@ DA has taken Kenya from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of TV reports of the ARD , alleg@@ ations were repeatedly raised that in Kenya dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible and there should be a considerable ment@@ ality of sports fraud .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently asked for a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had employed in Russian athle@@ tics .
in doing so , it could be proven that this sport has been systematically and systematically dop@@ ed in this sport .
Russia &apos;s athletes were subsequently excluded from the summer games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Salzburg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Shakespeare @-@ Jahr the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the help of a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the artistic director , Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled the role of Maria a youth room .
in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we have Bernstein &apos;s music really in our blood !
in this production Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she re@@ members with melanch@@ oly her love with Tony while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
firstly because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then Mary &apos;s personality would be .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so she is clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passion@@ ately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very similar to me , my Italian character , which I have as a Roman &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor to work with her .
it is a mon@@ strous human being .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli res@@ ig@@ ns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in every movement , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a happy approach to life , that is very important at all !
for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is up @-@ to @-@ date with the West Side Story : &quot; this piece is about prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
today we have the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ ert@@ ories have gone to New York , and the New York residents did not want them .
they are the same topics , and they are as meaningful today as at that time .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London school@@ girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
Ka@@ di@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria a few weeks ago .
it was assumed that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , I@@ TV news on Thursday .
Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she pre@@ tended to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can only hope that the only good is - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - stopping people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other girls from the east of London entered a plane to Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and became a widow in a few months .
Rei@@ d says Clinton will remain the Supreme Court in the case of a winning victory in Gar@@ land
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the Demo@@ crat candidate , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the Ju@@ dge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ land &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the de@@ ceased judge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference he expects Clinton to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ land with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he had not talked to Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and spec@@ ulate .
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the highest judge for the U.S. App@@ ell@@ ation Court for the District of Columbia .
RAID said re@@ public@@ ans had blocked the Gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , be lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump .
he also noted Donald Tr@@ ump was un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
Tre@@ ats wants to be a neck calendar for &quot; Women and for Men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazine co@@ operates with photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mers to bring out a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they would like to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 .
the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his neck magazin differ@@ ed from ol@@ school play@@ boys because &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he is of the opinion that it does the calendar too .
&quot; we have to return to the representation of timeless and classical n@@ ak@@ edness in which both women and men feel at ease and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release for the publication of the calendar .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or in person at open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community expects mass flight
&quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t fit and Erdo@@ gan pra@@ ises is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ proxim@@ ate foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kur@@ ds congregation of Germany reck@@ ons with tens of thousands of protective seekers fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany at short notice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , it might even become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the president of the association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the hard pre@@ val@@ ence of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan following the attempted coup attempt , the Kur@@ ds congregation of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with several hundred thousand prot@@ ectors from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the president of the association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday .
because the government has already over@@ hau@@ led Kurdish high @-@ bur@@ gers with criminal charges some months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds are fle@@ eing Turkey .
after the s@@ worn put@@ sch still secular and op@@ position@@ ist ethnic Turks would be added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will restart in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that takes up refugees even in their own country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the association compla@@ ined about the systematic settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities .
Erdo@@ gan thus aims to increase the exit pressure to the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been wi@@ ped out or driven out in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the Association demanded that the federal government positioned itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharply as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , too , there is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel no longer safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the br@@ anding as Gü@@ len @-@ Pend@@ ant anni@@ hil@@ ates teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t fit and Erdo@@ gan pra@@ ises is sitting on packed coff@@ ees , by the way also Kem@@ alist and s@@ cul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ oriented Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the newspaper reports on figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks already set the largest group of asylum holders recognised because of political persecution in Germany before the coup .
as of June 30 , this amounted to 11.@@ 3@@ 86 people and therefore nearly 29 per cent of all recognised as eligible for granted asylum ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this elevation , there is no wage in the face of war , poverty or lack of perspective .
asylum rights according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals don &apos;t get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
2021 will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
but it &apos;s not stupid as before : summer holidays , heat and country elections - that bites .
the locals , who are supposed to be convinced by the election champi@@ ons , are on vacation .
most of the holi@@ day@@ makers travelling in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not natives , so you may not choose the Land@@ tag .
there are practical problems : during the holidays hel@@ pers who hang up posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , fl@@ atten out fl@@ yers and en@@ umer@@ ate votes at the end are just te@@ di@@ ous to apply .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign shortly before the people over .
the hot phase , if one can say it at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his office .
the SPD , strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind CD@@ U in surveys .
exciting is how strongly newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition du@@ sty .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years of age and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from his large posters .
he travels across the country , distributing roses and chat@@ ting a little with the people , just as his legendary elo@@ qu@@ ent predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff also did .
otherwise , Mark@@ ering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the debt on the rise of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ha@@ sten@@ ed the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which is now likely to cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U , with its leading candidate , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced what it is like to make election campaigns at the right place at the wrong time .
she has invited chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale demonstrations twice ; Merkel &apos;s federal election district is located in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , secretary general of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad not to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel .
apart from that , the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U largely disp@@ enses with the usual campaign conditions at market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this , says Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union has also noticed that you are crum@@ bling the base in the country that it has to make a lot of effort to find a wire to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it goes like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any present in the vast expan@@ ses of the country .
the advice of the CD@@ U election campaig@@ ner Co@@ co to his co @-@ workers is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; they have to go where it is , where people are : village festivals , golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now appe@@ aled its SPD to a particularly committed election campaign .
in poll@@ s , the S &amp; D Group lag@@ ged behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the election of 2011 , the SPD gained a clear victory of 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in poll@@ s , should make the leap into the Land@@ tag .
they make a modern virtue out of holiday @-@ need and lay their election campaign largely on the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the name of the president of the country Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , green campaig@@ ners go to search for local vocal ch@@ ords under the vac@@ ation@@ ers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ ates straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ en@@ bur@@ gian lakes and also finds it beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electoral holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 renovation : restaurants suffer from block@@ age
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated .
for those responsible for the construction works , which begin at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and end only at 8@@ pm , praise is everywhere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they made everything pretty jag@@ ged , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super team .
there is no delay .
the construction site could be moved to the south according to schedule at the end of the week , until the end of October everything should be ready .
also praised is the receipt of those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to setting up accommodation .
since the construction site moved to the south on Monday and also the locking of the Asp@@ erg@@ strasse in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and therefore the connection to Rot@@ tenburg has resum@@ ed , the traffic situation within the town has relaxed .
citizens can now sail on both sides from O@@ fan@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 .
the road through the village seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there have been considerable complaints there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Deputy Chief Executive Officer Florian King , responsible for the rehabilitation management of the refurb@@ ishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of the street , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ eping trails were searching and more familiar with their navigation than the sign@@ age .
what led to the fact that some trucks parti@@ ed in residential areas .
as the speed limits were not met , the municipality also called for an increase in the M@@ ös@@ singen vehicle .
&quot; there have been considerable over@@ steps , &quot; says King , who made himself aware of the situation .
two to three per minute have been made .
the fastest speed was 77 ho@@ ur@@ ly kilometers in the speed 30 zone .
since the construction site has been moved , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business@@ men on the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg the road is open again .
business@@ men don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 rehabilitation has led to revenue out@@ breaks allows everyone to look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; who has less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. produced for other companies , for which the renovation has hardly any consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also at the deal@@ er@@ ship Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z talks about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maximum slight decline &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also ad@@ mits that of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the running @-@ class is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most heavily exploited are the local streets .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly a crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all restaurants have hit it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil .
we have to be happy about every Euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he estimates the sales losses to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road renovation took its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back for two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has to release half of his associates .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted otherwise .
instead Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dent Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation , with the hint that the restaurant would benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27 . now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the rehabilitation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where something was handled more gener@@ ously .
with all complaints G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , the family business has been here since 17@@ 15 and refers to the long history .
he can understand that other regular guests are now less frequently visited because of complicated traffic .
if you can &apos;t go there , it is also somewhere else nice .
the fact that his pedi@@ gree returns to the end of the refurb@@ ishment work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts about it .
despite the crises with BSE and avi@@ an flu , G@@ öh@@ ner keeps the effects of the B 27 construction work on his client@@ ele for the biggest crisis that his restaurant experienced in its long history .
six months of construction work , this is brutal already .
the name of the fight against terrorism is constantly being ro@@ uted to laws .
after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère now presents a thick security package .
but what has a dignity state to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all of this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the verse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t demand anybody .
other points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also participated in this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as Minister of the Interior , he was on the basis of results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , De Mai@@ zi@@ ère had a little time to pass before he presented his conclusions for security in the Republic .
but these are all the more extensive .
some things are already known , announced , announced : the fact that a new security authority has to deal with the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU specifications on passenger data and weapons law .
the call for more video surveillance and security officials is also not surprising .
in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second attempt for proposals which were not to be done with the SPD so far : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ ck jihadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U @-@ man ad@@ mits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he nevertheless considers this to be reasonable and also don &apos;t demand anything that the co@@ ali@@ tions partner has no chance anyway .
a few new ideas also present de Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
sometimes they have in themselves : he plans fast processes for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ain@@ ing people from deportation .
refugees that are targeted at the country should check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
in the case of di@@ sen@@ g@@ agement for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some worse than before - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of it is politically and legally un@@ lawful .
many things also seem to have been sp@@ un off and leaves questions un@@ answered .
and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of pati@@ ently for example - the question arises : what does this actually have to do with safety and terror ?
yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror .
but it is not possible to deny that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
in addition , in view of the high number of refugees , many people worried about security .
and things that people deeply dealt with could not be cl@@ utter@@ ed in election campaign times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the internal security has moved into the focus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
first the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attack in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are campaigns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Union and SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the topic of inner security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last days , it went up between the two parties .
only a gar@@ chy dispute about the features of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some of the Interior Ministers , in which the department leaders also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from dual citizenship .
also here de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is struggling for irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able sounds .
he doesn &apos;t receive anything from a return from the double pass .
we have limited the discussion in Germany .
re@@ opening them is not useful .
and in case of a Bur@@ ka ban he has constitutional obj@@ ections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether its own package is constitu@@ tionally un@@ constitutional and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ tions partner , must first show itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a lot of things that could cause conflict .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the SPD is currently attempting to profit from internal security in the issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , which contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen is still getting worse .
despite diesel emissions , deliveries are increasing worldwide .
but it does not run smoothly in all markets .
in the recall action , there is confusion around a term .
Volkswagen starts deliveries in the second half of the year .
despite the diesel atmosphere , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer is able to advance further growth despite the diesel engine thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July , the VW Nu@@ clear brand was weaker especially in Western Europe and thus again bur@@ dened the total sales , as the company listed in Da@@ x announced .
in July , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles than the previous year &apos;s month with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars .
sales in Western Europe alone , the second most important market in China , sales were 14 percent below the year @-@ earlier figure .
in the home market Germany the deliveries dropped by almost one sixth .
head of sales Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann brought back the weaker figures from July , especially to two sales days less in Europe .
in addition , in some core markets , there has been a purchase restra@@ int in some core markets through &quot; changing economic conditions . &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um also stressed the EU &apos;s exit from the EU , explained a spokes@@ woman .
in the USA , where the exhaust gas has first escal@@ ated , a minus is also available .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the main affected family brand of the Lower Saxony is anyway worse by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only a delivery minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available .
group sales chief Fred Kap@@ pler was able to advance further sales from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had been rig@@ ged with a software exhaust test .
in Germany alone , VW is calling for some 2.5 million vehicles to upgrade to the workshops .
as part of the conversion VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of the cars did not have any negative effects .
after upgrading the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the conversion , the car manufacturer would issue a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , but I do not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was stated on Friday in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason are legal entities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen is now granting its German customers a guarantee of retro@@ fitted diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday .
from the ministry of transport it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has to fulfill the requirements of my Inves@@ tig@@ ative Commission and the KBA in full . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; deviations from this are not accepted , &quot; stated Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry .
VW has assumed the guarantee that in the case of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after the conversion , no wor@@ sen@@ ing will take place and all type @-@ approved vehicle values remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the term &quot; warranty &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers , for example , come into a workshop for example half a year after the conversion - and this could lead back to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the interests of the customer it is important to avoid that in case of any other damage , which has nothing to do with the exhaust @-@ sc@@ andal , it comes to uncertainty with regard to possible warranty regulations as it was called . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore VW is not using the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see calls for a second institute in Germany from rich savers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; bank manager Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros in sight deposits or daily cash accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German banks speaks of an individual case and does not see it as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savers do not have to fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to pay pen@@ al punishment for their savings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if banks deposit money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they will have to pay their 0.@@ 4 % penalty .
the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund calls for this fee from September of September by private and corporate customers for deposits of more than EUR 100,000 on sight deposit or day @-@ to @-@ day money accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 euros in the year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for quite some time he be@@ headed 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day to the other and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me on the Central Bank account and cause 0.4 per cent of costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t lie down for every million 4000 Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost he now passes on according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter pays principle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; leaving the cash in the v@@ aults of Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced four rob@@ ber@@ ies , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most customers would have understanding and changed to other forms of investment .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bavarian Co@@ operative Association stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs for all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to carry it alone is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically viable not possible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks therefore have increased their bank account fees , credit cards or transfers .
the Thur@@ in@@ gian Volks@@ en- und Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 made head@@ lines with pen@@ al interest for deposits of three million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , head of the banking union , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay flat fees for deposits , but the competition in Germany is too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said on Lake T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a client@@ ele that is endow@@ ed with a bit more opul@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it be@@ ware money for free . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , the G@@ mund cooperative bank has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well @-@ known actors , sports@@ men and entrepreneurs live in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment , no other banks are known to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Union of Co@@ operatives &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which charge a charge for deposits made by private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokesperson , Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banken and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into the negative is very , very high . &quot;
competition is tough , and the immigration of investors to the competition is threatening .
customers in Germany won &apos;t let that in the l@@ ati@@ tude .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
lonely middle @-@ aged men love plates .
before you rush to the comments section to sow it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym Non@@ Alle@@ En@@ vel@@ id Men &apos;s Inter@@ medi@@ ate with ar@@ du@@ ous insul@@ ts , this statement deri@@ ves from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the many @-@ addressed resurrection of records is not attributable to a boom in millenni@@ als , who want to welcome the news of physical objects but to Mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght after the age of 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
it &apos;s also not a hor@@ de by amateur collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older vendors still retain their feelings ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
if this blog is a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , wearing a modest grey suit and tum@@ ble wild before I stay , hold my hands and say something better : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
even if the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record shops .
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to turn the camera off for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observing .
Stu@@ art from Glas@@ gow , 55 , whom I of Si@@ ster Ray ( data number : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of data : eight men middle aged , one woman , probably around 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through business to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I already value , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
these records , pictured above ( he sent me the snapshot by email , I did not follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason he has such a vast number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford than they appeared and to buy items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 1960s , early 70 &apos;s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I guess was too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and add : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers whom he meets are meeting on the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pub , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are forced to buy their old records again .
from the conversations that I have led , people usually have been getting rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom of followers of the plate chan@@ ts of a given age .
but what about the alleged emotional significance of plates ?
it only takes a few seconds in a store like F@@ onica to see that record stores offer a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers hit the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some of the record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to stand back to the stability of confidential vinyl covers , from objects that awaken happy memories .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; says WE@@ Z .
that is with me as a collector so I think it is so with many people .
it &apos;s a simple way to get involved spiritually .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a colleague explo@@ des from a record pile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month had not yet heard them .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player , which they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record do not own a record player .
at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried as I pass through a stack of bos@@ sa nov@@ a compil@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( data number : three middle @-@ aged men ) has noticed a &quot; trop@@ hi@@ es aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; someone came here just recently and said : &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead sound plate so that I can put them on the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less musi@@ c@@ astic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones , who come in slowly .
F@@ op@@ p , which has devoted almost a whole floor to the sound@@ boards , has a colorful audience when I go in .
there are couples around 70 , tourists who take photos , teenagers and middle aged women .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s newest syn@@ thesizer and sex@@ ton pop instead of experimental jazz ro@@ gues from the loudspeakers - is it good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks stran@@ gely lonely , but the psychological trauma is hard to det@@ ectable by standing beside someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the store for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale .
it is more of a shopping mall stroll than buying a big one .
it doesn &apos;t deserve much , so collecting sheets is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; she drives off with a de@@ ar@@ ted si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I am preten@@ ding to mu@@ te the jeans hot@@ tie , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who are group@@ ing around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a crossover record player .
on the left there is a stair@@ way , a wall full of records of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soh@@ o , there is nothing to complain about .
it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates .
even though my research showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , they are un@@ considered , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record stores and online forums .
these people probably work hard in school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday mor@@ nings with security not by stro@@ lling through the record shops of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates as they avoid the star@@ ving gaze of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 year old false moder@@ ator who is ra@@ ging beyond the shoulders of a middle @-@ aged men .

French Court re@@ jects an offer on the demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle of refugee camps
a French court has rejected an offer from the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live .
during a trial hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary transactions where individuals within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to gas drinks , sell hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be demol@@ ished because they would represent a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid and which contain a fire and san@@ ity risk .
humanitarian groups shared the court that businesses and restaurants are important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not provide sufficient food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also led to the fact that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who run the 72 temporary shops , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; were absolutely comprehensible . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ju@@ dge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that the grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely feeding people who &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the breaking down was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is operated profit@@ ably and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 170@@ ,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian it was said that the closure would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children of a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimates on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle of the jungle increased to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number up to now - after a steep increase in newcom@@ ers over the summer .
despite the Olympia disappointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant
despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing performance in the Olymp@@ ian timing , cycling pro Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to get involved .
&quot; I keep an eye on the World Cup , remain confident and continue , &quot; the 31 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook .
he does not have an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place at the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me to comment on the timing of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
let him analyze the reasons for de@@ bac@@ le .
Martin wanted to fight for the title at the time @-@ driving World Cup in Qatar in October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look closely at everything we have changed over the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Microsoft announced on Thursday how much money goes for the tak@@ eover .
Be@@ am went to the start with his offer in January and has already more than 100,000 users .
you can watch others while playing , but also intervene .
for example , they can give up missions to players and ju@@ x@@ t@@ apos@@ e enemies as well as provide equipment .

for the customer , nothing should be changed by the acquisition .
Be@@ am is integrated in the video gaming department around the Xbox console , according to Microsoft .

here comes the Enfor@@ cement trailer
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation of speed meters : in different federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash@@ es are tested , which should be particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic Enfor@@ cement trailer of Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used , for example , in the areas of accident , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itated bridges with temporary speed limit , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a stationary set @-@ up for compliance with speed limits .
a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
the Enfor@@ cement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days in continuous measurement , the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be detected at the same time across multiple tracks .
variable speed limits as well as travel restrictions on time , ticket and vehicle class can also be monitored .
the trailer can be moved in a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art condition according to the manufacturer with each car with trailer hit@@ ch .
so that it is not simply st@@ owed , it is lowered in the measurement mode , so that the wheels disappear in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and , by the way , a bul@@ let @-@ proof outer hull .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the bl@@ itz from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer is tested according to Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .
foreign authorities also flash with the new technology : recently France has ordered 100 copies , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
United Kingdom brings Silver in 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class gets Gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at 7 @-@ er rug@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt in the final hur@@ dle in the form of the Fi@@ j@@ is on Thursday night when they were defeated in Rio de Janeiro with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ odor@@ o Stadium .
Fi@@ ji provided a master class in handling , side @-@ stit@@ ching , back backs , line and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color .
the defeat was defeated by the not too bad con@@ sol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back to them in the final .
but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in top form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least a Brit@@ on will have a gold medal tomorrow around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is &apos;s head coach Ben R@@ yan , former chief of England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path behind it .
eight years ago , she lost any game under R@@ yan at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they only lost one .
this hat@@ ch will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji started wonderful and let off the attacks of G@@ Bs from fun .
it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . as if they were running in running buses . the World Series W@@ inners went 5 @-@ 0 upwards when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au was craw@@ ling in the corner .
with just four minutes of playing , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner he turned around .
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely touched the ball .
a h@@ edge tac@@ kling of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain from Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third gate , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh @-@ minute ath@@ lete j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right corner a touch down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the re@@ union and there was still more than one minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pressed another weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med down to the line to make a fool .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it is as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 while GB still cores .
this is how it is .
GB led basic changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for a whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua tou@@ red after a brilliant interim play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Sea sul@@ phi@@ an , whose fans sang , flags wave and danced on the grand@@ stand .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach to Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame topped the cake with another attempt in the last few seconds .
the whi@@ stle was ring@@ ing , the Fi@@ j@@ is embra@@ ced and GB ki@@ cked down crush@@ ingly into the lawn .
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa in a tight half @-@ fin@@ als match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks forward in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a goal in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , brother of Anthony of the 15 @-@ side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the coach &apos;s cancer
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ less gold than in those games and that wants to be called something .
from the first ru@@ dder to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve , who go down in history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional significance in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
the echo of the coach Robin Williams was there when she ruined the second Olympic gold in the second without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sport , who set such a standard .
her domin@@ ance was absolute , at least her 3@@ 9th un@@ written assignment , which is likewise unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant female ath@@ lets , who slide over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the nature of the Tri@@ umph@@ al .
behind each gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make the difference and there was no one more helpful than the trainer who did not know 30 months ago whether he would survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that &apos;s what they did .
if you don &apos;t do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a very bad situation .
it changes a bit the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , which kept the break to a minimum , if this is the right concept in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to get better soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it begins .
rowing in itself is a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory her first thoughts went to Williams who spent a nerve wre@@ cking morning with a little more than anything else , trying to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ anning who was a captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . maybe it &apos;s a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much that means , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked .
it was three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin , we wouldn &apos;t be anyone , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person to train or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost any race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to stop , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not out to make something great .
we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race what we did .
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about their future .
glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV @-@ advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to understand that I was an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exemplary transparency provided for 31 years
the managing director of the &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , retired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is considered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemplary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian pot@@ able water @-@ purpose band@@ age as a model for the big water producers .
some time ago it was said in the origin@@ als in a contribution by the Bavarian Radio .
little later the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia acknowledged the purpose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian far than exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , who worked for 31 years in the Zw@@ eck@@ verband employee , was 28 years as Managing Director .
he was now retired at the age of 65 .
the pot@@ able pot@@ able water association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group , located in Kot@@ t@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brun@@ n , transports approximately 150@@ ,000 cubic meters of water per year and supplies 32 places and hamlet with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member communities are the municipalities Kirch@@ hoff , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply contracts for other towns and villages .
the current chair@@ woman , Breit@@ brun@@ n mayor Ger@@ tru@@ de Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler was appointed as a water go@@ al@@ keeper in 1985 and was appointed CEO of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water pipeline construction and maintenance work to office and organizational activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency kits on weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as an outstanding event , it called the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchase in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the refurb@@ ishment of the elevated tank ( 1999 ) , the re@@ purchase of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the re@@ modelling of water pipes .
there has never been a stand@@ still and there have been innovations again and again because water is the most important food for water and drinking water .
in its lau@@ dation , she praised Go@@ eth &apos;s faithful , reliable and correct service for more than 31 years .
he used a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose band@@ age and he literally lived the water @-@ purpose band@@ age as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the concept of success of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group for nit@@ rate reduction in front of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia water forum .
for this he received a lot of praise and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , for his part , praised Mr. Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water go@@ al@@ keeper and he was a faithful little boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as high points from his point of view , he described the well construction and the restructuring of the purpose association .
but the biggest challenge and the most difficult application were the tu@@ bing in the high can@@ ister at Kirch@@ hoff on a 3rd January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the villages could be supplied with water .
also the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n could only be maintained , because one filled the high reservoir of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water management association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example : if I ask him something two years ago when I sang at La Scala , he remembered nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot;

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - husband shoots to life partner
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at 10.@@ 45 in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( Stor@@ mar@@ n district ) and killed her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called upon us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator was on the run , and after him I was openly punished .
meanwhile , Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a lat@@ ch .
meanwhile , the police have published a photo of it .
however , it is a couple of years old .
meanwhile , the man is wearing a sl@@ oth .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the gun with him , the police .
those who see Sven S. will call the 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator 1981 .
at first , the police in Lü@@ beck did not want to provide any information about the ta@@ vern or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims ; but it confirmed that a human being had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing delic@@ acy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more about this at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a Special Operations Command ( SE@@ K ) was at the crime scene .
steel - prospects for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ packed and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains unaffected by additional costs in millions of millions .
financial burdens that the sector threatened from the cost of green electricity are from the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) remains at the release of the renewable energy environment for the so @-@ called self @-@ current production in the German steel industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission was therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gas from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened to cover an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission following talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators are replaced in the steel plants , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent will fall .
but this too will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on self @-@ suffici@@ ency .
in this way , the status quo of the previous regulation is largely determined .
the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have a special significance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; steel is future &apos; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more must follow &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the climate and employment targets are also to be weighed in the reform of emissions trading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has suffered under over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year , the situation wor@@ sen@@ ed more sharply than the world &apos;s largest producer of producer China threw masses of steel into the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers throw price dump@@ ing in Chinese steel companies .
in the course of this spring , the situation has been somewhat relaxed .
on the one hand , imposed import duties on import steel show impact , on the other hand the economic prospects in China have brigh@@ tened up .
it is not clear how sustainable the price collection is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , the prices would have stagn@@ ated .
the industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
last but not least , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp also did not want to exclude the closing of individual works .
around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July , the German steel producers are cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Economic Association announced on Friday .
after a short increase in May the quantity produced went back to the second month consec@@ u@@ tively .
production has been below the year @-@ earlier figure by two percent since the beginning of the year .
in the coming months , the association anticip@@ ates an improved order situation thanks to an improved order situation .
community , mind , health : singing does sen@@ iors well
the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp into her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , she occupied the subject of music in the Leh@@ ra@@ mt @-@ studies , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior choir .
&quot; singing moves me - emotional and physical , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall living , she says .
by the way , she does something good for her health and mind .
because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler says of the German senior league .
most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , H@@ ac@@ kler describes .
through regular gather@@ ings , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to talk and organize , to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be stress@@ ful in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for this reason , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled respir@@ ation .
those who regularly demand their lungs are not as fast as they can in everyday life .
even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old , singing is an optimal hobby .
on the elderly , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursul@@ a L@@ enz from the Federal Employment Agency of the Sen@@ iors @-@ Organis@@ ations .
in the older generations the common singing had a much higher value , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure time , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people ar@@ ouses many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
through lyrics and especially melodies , dementia patients fall back to long @-@ lying events .
in singing , the head also requires special performance , explains L@@ enz .
to focus simultaneously on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially older people who live alone practice so not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ esteem is also growing by singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I practise for a long time , I will get better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start singing is enough .
those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent , L@@ enz suggests .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who is listening when there is a sound next to it ?
looking for the right offer , Sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ tances in a retirement home , one simply can join .
many cities also offer views over the choirs in the surrounding area .
anyone wishing to sing in an ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ as@@ tical choir can turn directly to the church or church leader .
you can also find many old choirs through the Internet .
those who have no access to the Internet can ask family , friends or neighbours for help with internet searches .
those who want to sing should definitely join a choir , H@@ ac@@ kler says .
singing does good to the soul and has something liber@@ ating - it applies to all ages .
cats react more sensi@@ tively than cat on scre@@ ams of the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover the effect that k@@ itt@@ ens &apos; sleep has on adult animals .
to their surprise , the ch@@ ewing also did not let the males cold - however , they always remained the same in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the reg@@ ression of k@@ itt@@ ens at the ch@@ ewing of the little ones .
they respond by ten percent faster to sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens , who have found themselves in great distress , as scientists have discovered by the veter@@ inary Academy and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
han@@ go@@ vers are also responding to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the ch@@ ewing of less and strongly arous@@ ed young are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from MH@@ H .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a previous investigation , the team of researchers had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens are different with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness .
a total of nine adult males and eight female cats were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a herd of little ones , who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition .
the researchers hold their results despite the low sample for meaningful results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who didn &apos;t have their own offspring , responded to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned faster to the loudspeaker , if this calls were played by the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may be inn@@ ate or develop with sexual maturity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have ever re@@ acted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men to baby sounds .
some studies also showed that women were sensitive to babies , no matter if they were mothers or not , the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski resort to Super@@ cup with &quot; Gala &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ sels is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant was issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ sels .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the attempted coup attempt , an important football match will be held in Turkey .
before the du@@ el of the arch @-@ riv@@ als between the em@@ ik@@ tas of Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is un@@ equi@@ vocal : &quot; business as usual . &quot;
already in the case of a state of emergency following the attempted coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at in July , the government , the everyday life of normal citizens , should not be affected .
this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the Movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt .
this is also not done before football .
the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s Office issued an arrest warrant against the former strong @-@ strong Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r .
accordingly , the South Africa living in America is now being accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ kü@@ r is to be a suppor@@ ter of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the exception for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact , most Turks have virtually no effect on the lives of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the noc@@ tur@@ nal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan to be finished on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into tra@@ ilers and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Colom@@ bian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club of Workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not traditionally count among the friends of the president . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what unites the great of the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at cup winner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be especially on Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cologne in the past season proved its sporting value : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as a top@@ scor@@ er of his club .
in the final match against F@@ ener@@ b@@ ah@@ ce he achieved the 1 : 0 victory buffer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured his tro@@ phy to his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record champion had a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the round @-@ kno@@ ck@@ out kno@@ ck@@ out in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; say good @-@ bye to the Europa League .
in the Sü@@ per Li@@ g , it was only sixth .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed this and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the year of the game was better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez who laid the basis for the 14th title with 26 season hits as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ ment@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to continue to hope for the return of the 31 year old .
in doing so , the accord signed with AC Florence and returned to Bes@@ ik@@ tas after the attempted coup attempt failed to return because of the political situation in the country after his EM vacation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he only has to say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the specialist magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club Director Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the Stür@@ mer would have to be willing to ren@@ ounce about one @-@ third of its annual sal@@ aries estimated at 7.5 million Euros , and Or@@ man pointed out : &quot; we cannot pay its salary in Florence . &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes still have med@@ als at Olympic Games in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova can &apos;t start in Rio .
other over@@ stated athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh at it - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
the topic of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers in Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ owa , who had compla@@ ined of their starting right shortly before the games after a lo@@ oping ban , was pi@@ ped out and booked at their start ( 100 meters chest ) .
a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scenery was offered : she was still standing in the hall with a smile on her face and provoked her appearance .
when he found out that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience burst into a rush of j@@ okes .
but there are still numerous other sports@@ men who go to the start despite the dop@@ ing past at the Rio Olympics .
here is an overview :
J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was already locked two times for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its spell the Olympic champion from 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion has been running even faster than before , he is the number one in the world more than 100 metres in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the greatest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 m relay / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to reti@@ re in 2010 after taking the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after an operation , she had suffered severe tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympic champion from 2012 , world champion of 2013 and European champion from 2010 to 2016 , has been positively tested for the banned stimul@@ ant agent meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin .
Per@@ kovic denied the scientific intake and was locked for six months .
the four wil@@ dest lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the big gold favor@@ i@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 m relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , had been tested positive in 2010 and closed 21 months .
a means of penis enlargement was responsible , mar@@ red Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 metres .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer Th@@ row , Belarus ) : hardly any ath@@ lete had so many med@@ als afterwards .
thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after he was diagnosed with testosterone dop@@ ing .
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to give Olympia @-@ silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the European Championship in 2006 because of testosterone deficiency .
he also received the Bronze medal for the 2008 Olympic Games thanks to a verdict of the International Sports Court of the CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he ranks second on the world rank@@ ings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record and gold favor@@ i@@ tin was tested positive only in May but may still start in Rio .
in the 29 year old world championship points were found for taking a banned dietary supplement , the lock of World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ dly and ran off on 13 July .
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian inj@@ ures - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand was in touch with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , on Friday .
she had suffered cuts and had been treated at the hospital , but I could leave it again .
she planned her home trip at the beginning of September .
whether further explo@@ sions on the island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ umph@@ on are also affected by Austrian citizens , it is still unclear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities in this regard , says Schn@@ ö@@ ll .
at about 200 kilometres south of Bangkok &apos;s capital , Hu@@ a H@@ in initially explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening in a boom .
according to the police , a Thai b@@ ail@@ er was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning two explo@@ sives went up again , another man was killed , according to the authorities .
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket , a bomb explosion was reported in the morning .
a taxi driver was injured in det@@ onation near the popular beach of Pat@@ ong which was popular with tourists .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , on the south @-@ eastern coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded which killed an urban employee .
according to the authorities , the le@@ pro@@ sy had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the territory of the coastal police .
after all , some det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ umph@@ on on the south @-@ east coast called for several wounded .
one gets from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Army General Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ eg@@ am@@ ee Friday morning to journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect it to be a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too early to speak for possible motives , but most likely it was about the actions of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not related to the Islam@@ ist uprising movement or international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage which is limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , it is assumed that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
in recent days , the authorities have received secret evidence of im@@ pending attacks in the south of the country - though they had not been informed of the exact time and locations .
it is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
the police instructed their officials across the country to enhance security around important government buildings , airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand there are repeat@@ ed@@ ely smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they are mostly not directed against tourists .
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace built over the years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the mine explosion explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends the instructions of the Thai security authorities to follow .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no need for necessary trips to these provinces .
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were held a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the coming years .
Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs had been an attempt to fom@@ ent chaos , while the country is heading towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ rest that had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody civil stri@@ fe will benefit itself to restore the kingdom to stability and order .
however , it has not been possible for the military to get a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years .
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago , in Bangkok , 20 people were killed at an attack on a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack on the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been directed towards the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to several national offices , the constitution conserv@@ ation@@ ists in the League have also placed the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &apos; identity movement &apos; we see indications for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic basic order , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the Constitutional Court , Hans @-@ Georg Mayer , the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus immigrants of Islamic faith or the Middle East are diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist ways .
therefore we observe the movement as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through alien@@ ation . &quot;
constitution conserv@@ ation@@ ists in nine Bundes@@ länder - Bremen , Bayern , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - observe the &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ aß &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said his authority was closely coordinated with the regional offices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups such as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chief of the Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with you@@ thful speech , often with pop music .
the fac@@ ul@@ ties are Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a fu@@ tile advertising for one &apos;s own thing .
the propaganda is intended to address people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
recently , reports on contacts of the &quot; identity &quot; to Af@@ D politicians had been published in several federal states .
he said that he had no knowledge about that .
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point .
it depends on whether the party - in this case the Af@@ D - will change its direction by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist .
the deciding factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
with a view of the marked increase in right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shel@@ ters , Mao said he would not yet speak of new righ@@ tist terrorism .
but we have seen in recent years that there can be right @-@ wing structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
it may well be that other right @-@ wing terrorist groups or small groups form the attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee towers or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
however , a Germany @-@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ wing terrorism is not recognis@@ able .
the previous groups were formed at the regional level or in social networks .
worried about the fact that many offen@@ ders went to the account of people who had previously not appeared in the right scene .
this is the cause of concern .
many of the suspect in attacks on asylum accommodation had previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated off@@ ences or followers of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to reconci@@ le with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who might have been politically in@@ different or elected for example CD@@ U , SPD or lef@@ ti@@ sts , who , however , have radi@@ cal@@ ised themselves by far @-@ wing extrem@@ ist sentim@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te Bec@@ omes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
the Olympic Games or World Records not always determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ weigh@@ ted Ethiop@@ ian s@@ wimm@@ ers sw@@ am so slowly that he was no longer visible in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was chosen .
in social networks , Hab@@ te was subsequently transformed into the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his lead with a delay of 48 seconds and finished the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not exactly sporty figure , which attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special starting right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to promote swimming in under@@ represented countries .
since most sports@@ men run in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media called it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ble der W@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; following a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity belly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun of him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 m Fre@@ estyle , didn &apos;t play any part .
compar@@ isons with Eric the E@@ el were also drawn .
the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i spark@@ ed media attention at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney .
the appearance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea was unforgettable , when he had to go on alone in a can@@ opy over 100 metres of free @-@ standing .
f@@ ren@@ e@@ tisch , M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned swimming only eight months before the Olympic Games and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Ger@@ ets@@ ried - The owner of a shop in the New Place has been stolen .
according to the police , the 67 @-@ year @-@ old woman on Monday left her shop on Monday at 17.@@ 30 and forgot to close a window on the ground floor .

pump does not see the im@@ pending election defeat so tight
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump speaks at an election campaign event in Florida .
if there &apos;s nothing to do with the choice of the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already an alternative video .
he then goes on holiday .
if Donald Tr@@ ump is losing the US presidential election in November , it wouldn &apos;t matter : &quot; in the end it will either fold , or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the US television station CN@@ BC .
if it does not suff@@ ice for him for reasons of political correctness , be that in order , &quot; Tr@@ ump said .
thus he called US President Barack Obama and the demo@@ crat of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) .
in his party , however , more and more opposition was formed .
post climbs to trade with electric v@@ ans
an electric delivery vehicle by the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other firms in the vehicle is obviously great .
the post plans to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter as well .
the Group will shortly begin trading with the transpor@@ ter .
the post office wants to offer its electric v@@ ans on the free car market as of the coming year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter into the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ man on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been evaluating for months whether they are to sell their self @-@ developed stre@@ et@@ sco@@ ot@@ ers with which letters and pack@@ ets are to be sold to other companies .
post @-@ President Jürgen Ger@@ der had said that there are always questions , such as arti@@ sans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group wants to enter into the mass production of the vehicles shortly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the post @-@ owned factory , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and layer .
Ger@@ ber announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric vehicles , and in the long run a complete change@@ over to environmentally friendly vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we reloc@@ ate the entire fleet .

G@@ FR@@ P leadership decreases after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the re@@ tr@@ itte came suddenly - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K announced that Matthias Hart@@ mann &apos;s chair is all the more uncertain the longer the results promised by him .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after re@@ dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of the company management , the world &apos;s number five in the industry is facing a new beginning .
GF@@ K Executive Board wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board Ar@@ no Mahler is already dischar@@ ging from the Supervisory Board effective September 12 .
the management board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger , who was previously a member of the Executive Board , already informed the company as early as 1 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is supposed to officially take over the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CEO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann was found . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the long @-@ term commercial orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details did not want to mention a spokes@@ man on Friday .
those who will be the market research company in the future are still unclear at present .
in investor circles it was called on Friday , at the shareholders the disappointment of the continued success of the restructuring measures introduced years ago was great .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been on the Gf@@ K peak since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the recent bad Gf@@ K business figures , every shar@@ ehol@@ ding owner will some@@ day be rest@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this were the case with BMW , they would do the qu@@ and@@ ts like this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
following set@@ backs in the previous quarters , the Company did not have to stop its loss of power in the second quarter of 2016 .
sales of € 36@@ 1.2 million were 6.1 per cent lower than the previous year &apos;s figure .
sales of 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million euros were 3.@@ 4 percent in terms of the first half of the year .
the earnings in the second quarter , above all , imp@@ acted the company &apos;s reduced value in view of its difficult economic situation .
the good@@ will depreci@@ ation of EUR 139 million , which was necessary in the Consumer Experience business unit , contributed to the Group a loss of € 14@@ 8.2 million .
in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K generated a net profit of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - Bus sli@@ ps into cla@@ um@@ m@@ rels in tren@@ ches : eight injured
in the event of an accident of a travel agency with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ eh@@ n ( district of Aur@@ ich ) on Thursday .
two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , shared the police .
according to her specifications , the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to her specifications , had to ev@@ ade a vice vice , partly on the counter @-@ road .
the bus came to the right of the street and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , as a spokes@@ woman of the police inspec@@ tor Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the bus &apos;s location , people couldn &apos;t leave the bus autonom@@ ously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and one emergency ambul@@ ance came to the accident scene on the Landes@@ straße 2 .
the un@@ injured travellers were brought back from the bus back to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ aph@@ ne district of P@@ ew@@ all .
there they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the lor@@ ry and possible witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic metre of waste water are from 1 October 2016 for the area of the waste water system Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ th@@ igh 3 44 instead of previously 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ ez 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf € 3.@@ 64 ( up to now 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the facility in Az@@ endorf the waste water fee will be increased at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a preliminary calculation , the waste water in Az@@ zur@@ y will be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , in the approval of the budget by the district office Kul@@ mb@@ ach found that under@@ cover for these sewage systems was established .
due to legal bases , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the systems at a cost @-@ effective basis .
as of October 1 , 2016 , citizens and industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ ar , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to dig deeper into the pur@@ se .
fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Board Director Herbert Schmidt showed the panel , a new calculation of the charges for sewage treatment of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , it is also possible to compensate for over@@ - or under@@ cover from the foreg@@ o@@ ing calculation period .
the severe reb@@ ate increases Schmidt explained that there are relatively small facilities in all three sewage systems with very low waste water , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
as a result of the low distribution base , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact .
sewage charges in all three facilities are also slightly declining .
furthermore , in the rec@@ umbent calculation period , all three plants were not least incurred due to their age of refurb@@ ishment and repair expenses .
the plant in Az@@ zur@@ y is nearly 30 years old , the plants for Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ ik are almost 20 years old .
Schmidt indicated that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to a damage in the sewage plant in Az@@ zur@@ y .
the nearly 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led in the pump plant Wel@@ th@@ igh and after nearly 20 years of operation the first sewage pipe had to be removed , the sewage slu@@ dge dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation system had to be installed in order to comply with the water @-@ legal requirements in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to these extraordinary expenses came the continued maintenance and maintenance costs , which must be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were still considerably below the current level during the previous calculations in 2011 / 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made it clear that the expenses for the operation and maintenance are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully penet@@ rated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the three plants with low waste water . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , Schmidt added that the market share of large entertainment costs has been spar@@ ed in the waste water systems over the past 20 years .
the situation for the above @-@ mentioned facilities will continue to remain prec@@ arious in the long run , especially as one cannot extend the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal sewage association in order to avoid these facilities , because they are defici@@ ent institutions .
Bulgaria books inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that in July inflation was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the average annual average rate of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , a price increase in the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison with the previous month ; food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1,7 % ) ; transportation ( 1,8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0,1 % ) .
prices remained as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critici@@ zed
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say that it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filtering tool , Sn@@ ap@@ chat allows about 150 million everyday users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders on the absurd .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from Roy Licht@@ enstein &apos;s painting .
the filters are non @-@ flo@@ wery , self @-@ rotating tools that produce more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all mis@@ carri@@ ages reach the public .
in the past Sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have drawn criticism in which they were accused of promoting Black@@ face or white skin as a beauty ideal .
several critics called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face , &quot; as soon as this week suggested a filter to some users who gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and wre@@ cked che@@ eks .
they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a bigger problem that the company has with diversity .
the news and indignation were spread widely on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , one day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat told that it would have de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was designed as a tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced rac@@ ism rec@@ alled the filter of inf@@ ring@@ ing c@@ lich@@ és .
others refused the anim@@ e comparison .
grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani wrote in an e @-@ mail , a Korean @-@ American student , whose tweet has been widely spread over the photos that the filter was &quot; hur@@ t@@ ful and bad said uncomfortable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to argue with the contrast of a very reluct@@ ant Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and filter effects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ able , but that the yellow face has been dra@@ gged to the extreme .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses that cultural stum@@ bling block .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand .
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats &apos;s big audience of young people - who are more different than their older counterpart in terms of race - might expect to expect more sensitivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates an image that is insul@@ ting to a user , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is much more difficult for such things to remain un@@ noticed than it was before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
she said that race @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the recruitment practices of Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the large part of white , only male leadership and ended up with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that Sn@@ ap@@ chat mostly left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and refers to its status as a private enterprise .
on Thursday , Sn@@ ap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently hired a personnel responsible for concentrating on under@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu , on the other hand , said she is closing her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military leadership of IS@@ IS intelligence agencies , states Committee of Congress
military members of the United States Central Command adjusted intelligence intelligence to draw a more optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed it to report in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can Committee of the Army Committ@@ ees , Secret Service Committ@@ ees and the Com@@ for@@ cement Com@@ mit@@ ment , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Secret Service analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their appreciation to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence intelligence , typically det@@ ri@@ mental by high @-@ level Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly showed a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions on the spot would have allowed and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report .
&quot; what happened at the Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; stated Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives .
the management errors in the Cent@@ Com extend to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts saw themselves exposed to pressure from their superi@@ ors to draw a more optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , comments and statements prior to Congress were far more positive than the facts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com applicant publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin already in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , it &apos;s so clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , a Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the Central Command Council changed the intelligence reports to minimize the threat posed by IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the re@@ public@@ ans called Task Force in life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed with more detailed insights while the investigations will continue .
in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ Com are underway through the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defense .
democratic members of the intelligence committee published their own findings on Thursday which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com has created an over@@ ly restricted trial for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; gave the highest ranking Dem@@ ok@@ rat in the Committee , Member of the House of Represent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , Mr. Shi@@ p , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sh@@ ook the morality of analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was too little room for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Shi@@ p and the democr@@ ats stated that they had no clu@@ es on the intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ Com analysts as to a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s In@@ spec@@ tor who was accepted after Cent@@ Com &apos;s complaints .
according to C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the Congress , while investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ tor were still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under US leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , last year &apos;s accus@@ ations raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a document on how the then government under George W. Bush regarded only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the present reporting on the Islamic State .
in the past year , according to government officials , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker states that contrary to the government &apos;s statements , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these temporary refin@@ eries were put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
this recognition , however , was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ Com &apos;s Supreme Commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the Legisl@@ ative for his exc@@ essively positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel in Central Command .
the USA win fourth match in women &apos;s field ho@@ ckey , show@@ down with Great Britain is before
one day after having fired three goals during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games were supposed to be a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember what ever did .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am not one of the people who keep their doors in mind .
however , she knows : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , who remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final round of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will gain first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first place will take the strong Dutch somewhat longer out of the way that the other group leads .
whatever the game might start on Saturday , the Americans caused a surprising vor@@ tex through their success story four years after they landed on the last of 12 seats at the last London Games .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had a ho@@ ckey bat in hands for the first time with three years ( her two older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ xel university ) , at 16 years she became a national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the Ka@@ der .
then came 2012 when everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the national team and thus began to turn things to a better one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we didn &apos;t have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
we have been able to r@@ end the ru@@ dder completely .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the door @-@ room in the first half of the game with a back @-@ stroke from the close @-@ up area .
India had gone into the game without any victory , but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
it took a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and kno@@ cked the ball into the gate to get the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the Tor@@ keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; Par@@ n@@ ham said , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
in the heart of the Olympic Games R@@ age , the tramp@@ ol@@ ines &apos; Zen
wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and in@@ es@@ capable , a fast relay race between competition and quest .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod , which is handed out to the tri@@ ath@@ lete from the cross@@ bow sho@@ oter to float .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s conversation during the queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time with the Olympic Games and a s@@ warm of women with dimples , could have been among these well @-@ known names sent to prime time , built up by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising if he were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , a gymn@@ ast or even a fen@@ cer .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold at the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
the Olympic flame doesn &apos;t illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports , which are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast @-@ swimming and may it reign for a long time .
but if I would like to make more modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw your attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years has been so sc@@ andal@@ ously perceived that many who had asked me did not know it was ever an Olympic sport .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to compete , there has never been a medal in the tramp@@ ol@@ ines and until 2012 had an ath@@ lete who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians are inclined to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian women for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their Gold Med@@ al from London this year .
the trampoline jumping has a certain out@@ sider , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ enlightened E@@ ar for a c@@ lown school than the one for the Olympic Games .
at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an experienced enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ ous potential - the carto@@ on@@ istic trem@@ bling of its never @-@ ending boun@@ ce - but also the gra@@ dient of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two sports that essentially united .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spring@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
emerging vic@@ tors jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have to land a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you will be judged according to the official Olympic program according to the execution , difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
twenty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts have to move up and down in their quest for gold , sometimes to the finish , sometimes to the finish , sometimes towards the top and down@@ wards in the playground .
they not only ch@@ ase the finish line or the exit wall , but in the tel@@ ev@@ ised transmission also another highlight : the world or the Olympi@@ ad .
the pur@@ pos@@ eful striving is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to stir even a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it &apos;s also what I feel as a little ti@@ ring when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a breathing pause .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up again .
here too there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the target , no wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant suspension of time and gravity .
it &apos;s as zen as the competition can only be at the Olympics .
the qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; most of the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.@@ 00 .
in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be over@@ looked in general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by acquiring and obj@@ ecting male athletes - as the male American gymn@@ asts recently suggested according to the Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey anticip@@ ates his new fan base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a generation protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ethiopia , long one ally of the US &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators calling for political changes in Ethiopia met with violent resistance from the government .
witnesses testified that dozens of prot@@ esters were killed during the cl@@ ashes with the police in shooting exchanges .
is Ethiop@@ ian right to collapse ?
in the last ten years , it was one of Africa &apos;s most stable countries , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but during the last months protests against the government shaken the country and expanded into more and more areas .
last week thousands of people rush@@ ed onto the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the government &apos;s response to human rights organizations was mer@@ cil@@ ess .
witnesses stated that police brut@@ ally shot and killed dozens of un@@ armed prot@@ esters .
in circulation , videos that are circulating about the protests , probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security people strike young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the UN Human Rights Agency is now calling for a thorough investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , Project Manager of the Horn of Africa from the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated from the West .
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorist attacks beyond the region , especially in Somalia . few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is a new commu@@ ter train in Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba capital .
the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia was anything but a role model for democracy , human rights organisations have continually led to oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been limited , and dissi@@ dents were sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or prison , killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you op@@ press people and have no other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold in relation to the power of the ruling coalition .
following a widely critical election last year , the ruling party and its allies gained the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time , tensions along the border with Er@@ it@@ rea rise ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , disputed line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analysts worry that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den have been forced to exploit the turbul@@ ence and re @-@ arm themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness tend to explo@@ de under the surface after years of dr@@ ink@@ age .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
it was only in recent years that many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media , as cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more frequent and the internet services improved .
even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still can communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are staying .
several young Ethiop@@ ians stated that they gathered so much protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia &apos;s mainly Christian high lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and the economy as they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , many of whom are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but that is also changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are there to coordinate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ e@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray population , accounting for about 6 per cent of the population , domin@@ ating the military , intelligence , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister until his death at an illness that was not made public in 2012 for 17 years .
he was seen as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think of corners .
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ am@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively in@@ transparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia had experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , which , according to analysts , were apparently ple@@ dged by the government and subsequently stolen .
during the following ra@@ ids many prot@@ esters were killed , even though they were less than in the last months and this period of un@@ rest was passing relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction .
but obviously this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal miss@@ al of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ anian town , conducted shops of Tig@@ ray and hatred of Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more common in the social media .
analysts say that the protests lead the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for dome @-@ flights over neighboring Somalia , even though it recently announced that it has closed this base .
while West@@ ern@@ ers clearly want to support democracy , it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin balancing act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim to Obama that IS@@ IS was founded &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday , fear@@ ing that his multiple repeated claims , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton , were the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious .
this clari@@ fication raises new questions about the communication skills of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , whether he is able to communicate clearly and understand@@ ably with the American public .
it also ent@@ ails its fellow comb@@ at@@ ants who endeav@@ our to protect him during an event@@ ful phase , in the peculiar position of having to explain statements which he could not have meant at all .
after having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump left behind the alleg@@ ation on Thursday and insi@@ sted that he really did not intend to point out that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in a morning tweet on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the T@@ we@@ et was the opposite to the previous day , where Mr. Tr@@ ump told in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation was completely serious .
when the conservative radio present@@ er Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to help weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate did not want to know about it .
the last storm of criticism en@@ capsul@@ ates Mr. Tr@@ ump while trying to ste@@ er the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling survey values .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked to the economic situation in Mich@@ ig@@ an this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this topic again .
using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would result in higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he had a strong criticism when he thought that the Russians were to h@@ ack away Mrs. Clinton &apos;s e @-@ mails , but later he said , &quot; Of course , I said it sar@@ c@@ astically . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back down as needed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive , and then , if necessary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to what the reaction is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I also think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of def@@ using the vote for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an even more corro@@ sive tone because his survey values have gone further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a leading lead in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying not to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he frequently acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humor .
but while he is intensi@@ fying the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps has brought his loyal co @-@ workers into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent advoc@@ ates of Tr@@ umps , tried to defend the candidate in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comment@@ aries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani about the correctness of Mr Tr@@ umps about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had established the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organisation , he called it am@@ bush , completely false , and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream re@@ public@@ ans attempt to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton had served as Minister of Foreign Affairs , allowed IS@@ IS to spread to spread the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control .
before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of sp@@ ying around on each of his words and being prejudi@@ ced against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he desp@@ ised the poor , mis@@ erable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV experts trying to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats mo@@ cked Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s ap@@ ology as a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
once pushed over the price of the market , cafe is back in Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a nice cafe in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which didn &apos;t have Wi @-@ Fi , but served a good coffee for 15 years .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store were displaced .
soap Cher@@ ie &apos;s business , which replaced the verb in the summer of 2014 , sells handmade soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
native people mour@@ ned for the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel excluded and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is changing , it is also rein@@ vention .
a rev@@ ital@@ ised Club Cafe opened in Green@@ point last November , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
coffee is still good .
the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old coffee shop , who is the owner and managing director of the new cafe .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a customer offered him to provide funds for a new office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , retained a lot .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment too .
he introduced new ingredients .
there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese on the menu and there are gar@@ nish@@ es such as cap@@ ers and sau@@ ced onions .
there are natural rice dishes .
the café serves no more beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also displaced from Willi@@ am@@ sburg prices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira has been such a client .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg in former times and regularly visited the verb .
even after having moved to Green@@ point , she would take the road .
after the verb had closed , she gave up the coffee drinking for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized that there was a coffee and culture in the club I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee once again , although on that day she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i tea instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003 .
he went there before the work and in@@ vari@@ ably ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came fourth after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
today Ros@@ enthal always gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no gru@@ dge about the soap business having taken the old business space .
in fact , the owners of the soap Cher@@ ie offered to make a special soap for clubs with the coffee of coffee in the cafe as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will continue to offer her services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants of Green@@ point have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he has prepared to leave them soon , so that his new neighbours feel welcome .
the site also has other advantages .
a local juice restaurant would like to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee in the bottle .
there is a chance that the café is expanding to a nearby building .
for many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favour@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rich meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a gourmet , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for ingeni@@ ous Fi@@ fth Avenue treats like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on that day was a bit more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Bri@@ ck@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how to eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was about Chinese cuisine in the USA , while brick was told in her book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their latest cooperation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; An decent meal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a repor@@ ter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop , a small schn@@ au@@ c@@ ell@@ os@@ em snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
Bri@@ ck@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key ate with potato pur@@ ée and vegetable mixture .
when the repor@@ ter ordered h@@ ack@@ ed , this found the couple for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man said .
there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and p@@ opp@@ y bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper that stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating as many pe@@ an@@ uts as serving them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have been in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at Buffet , especially in rural areas .
men of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and freshly baked p@@ â@@ té were served for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans in the first World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; records the ways the country was going to be no longer the Sch@@ lar@@ aff@@ enland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for the Americans was a central , ten@@ se topic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e explained why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget@@ ary diet was just as ten@@ se : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ies became stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ole was a &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food residues &quot; as chefs were able to hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheap dried fruit .
meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rarely served luxury .
idi@@ osyn@@ cratic bl@@ ends have been tried since a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction has priority over taste or even healthy cuisine .
while resear@@ ching the book , which includes recipes , Bri@@ ck@@ man prepared a dish from that era , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addition to the mid@@ day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions don &apos;t match each other .
it was typical for many of the home business recipes .
like never before or since , budget econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - made the country &apos;s eating habits like that .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , she encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ keepers &quot; and to meet the challenge of changing pamp@@ as and cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a festival of historic tit@@ bits .
especially tasty are the reports on the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ eating @-@ attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farmer &apos;s kitchen kitchen of his kitchen , he feeds like the millions @-@ million man from the world to which he became .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining @-@ room and carried a smoke .
he was a del@@ ici@@ ously realistic .
President Roos@@ ev@@ elt could have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or urged him to cancel an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the hire of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Ms. Roos@@ ev@@ elt said that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting ones . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression to deal with food was dis@@ car@@ ded as soon as the country returned to the legs .
the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Ziegel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food .
the couple gave to the writing of the book better understood the eating habits of Ziegel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law - for example , how they could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was a real fear of food waste , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; bri@@ ck@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she actually made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the sei@@ zure of wind .
after having cleared the plates at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e brought out a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert that President Roos@@ ev@@ elt did eat at lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man , adding that it was a usual trick to give modest recipes a chic name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everybody di@@ ved somewhat reluct@@ antly a spoon into the tough , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber .

&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer , he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A couple of chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in the Assad regime &apos;s barrel bomb attack .
O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group who , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 60@@ ,000 people alive .
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives on the game to draw people out of bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civilian conserv@@ ation@@ ist who shows him during a 11 @-@ hour rescue of an inf@@ ant from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbol figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a hero , he never saw himself , but said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die in saving lives , I think God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrel bombs over the Alz@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now removing the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ nants of the bomb , so that no children can play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the painting quotes his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Greenland shar@@ k : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland shar@@ k usually only come to the surface in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day .
Greenland shar@@ k only get offspring with 150 years .
the Greenland shar@@ k flo@@ ats lei@@ surely at the bottom of the North Atlantic , reaching an average of just 1,@@ 220 metres in an hour .
only when it arrives , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates to a full 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a seal .
this slow@@ ness of lifestyle , however , seems to be a recipe for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at least from a Greenland shar@@ k that could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comments Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span that means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the bi@@ ologist suspected long ago that Greenland shar@@ k would become rock @-@ old .
only the evidence was missing .
Greenland sh@@ arks are hard to observe , finally they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface only in winter .
researchers know correspon@@ dingly little about the lifestyle of Greenland shar@@ k .
their slow motion measured them when they fitted out six animals with a transmitter just in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
prey make this sh@@ arks nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed up the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
maybe they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice cream and look for cad@@ a@@ vers , that are tor@@ tured from higher layers of water .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues were now exploring 28 Greenland sh@@ arks , which f@@ ishers between 2010 and 2013 brought to Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the biggest size was 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers .
to determine the age of the animals they analyzed with the carbon @-@ 14 method the lens nucle@@ us of the sh@@ arks .
this centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained therein are not replaced later .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
its birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , as a nuclear weapon search drew large quantities of this radioactive material into the atmosphere .
in comparison with 220 centimet@@ res of the third @-@ smallest animal , the lens nucle@@ us , on the other hand , contained a small amount of carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear weapons trying to celebrate its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
on the other hand , all major Greenland shar@@ k in their lens nucle@@ us had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 years for a 4@@ 93 @-@ cen@@ timeter @-@ long Greenland shar@@ k , while the record shar@@ k is likely to be 3@@ 92 years old with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers .
that Greenland shar@@ k females only get offspring , if they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to assign the length to an age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood at the threshold to become sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland shar@@ k with the multip@@ lication obviously suffer at least one and a half centuries of time .
this is also likely to be a world record for verteb@@ rates .
it is not by chance that such Meth@@ us@@ el@@ es live mainly in icy waters .
also the previous record holder , a col@@ t of 211 years old , in whose bac@@ on on the neck was a 120 year old har@@ po@@ on tip was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on a flame of as@@ par@@ ag@@ us .
so they mature later - and age slowly .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often particularly large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than one gram of elephant .
another advantage : they have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on as many offspring as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the Evol@@ ution@@ ary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very large animal , on the other hand , should rather invest its resources in a long life .
building site in double pack
the Council of the Council has dealt with issues relating to construction in the most recent session .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the Panel resum@@ ed the communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , the commerci@@ alisation of newly @-@ proven residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the municipal council is convinced that the oc@@ cl@@ usal surfaces in rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au attract young families and other sen@@ iors equally .
as it was said , volunteers can immediately report to the Town Hall , and the municipal council is expected to advise the municipal council in its September meeting .

Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
the city on the Main has the best opportunities to attract jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Financial Markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether or not money will continue to operate from London through financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU passport , approval has been granted to them in the UK .
these are using large US banks .
several banks have already announced to reloc@@ ate jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lobby Association anticip@@ ates 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance Super@@ vision E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk plan ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less important for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg ad@@ mitt@@ edly trimm@@ ed a large fund industry , but did not cut off the infrastructure as well as Dublin .
thanks to the big airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach .
in addition , the city features easily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it &apos;s not as easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial properties are 50 percent higher than in the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the company consulting Mer@@ cer , the city ranked 7th , Luxembourg in place 19 , Dublin in number 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial hub for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the I@@ W concluded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , my economic researcher .
in London , according to figures of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , some 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015 , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead receives legal expenses from the Hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. District Ju@@ dge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal costs arising from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June Gilead was exemp@@ t from damage compensation in the amount of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead stood after a U.S. judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the Mein@@ icy and other un@@ ethical acts .
at the request of the law@@ suit on Thursday , U.S. President Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to reli@@ ve the costs incurred during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck is trying to syn@@ th@@ esi@@ ze Gilead that gover@@ ns the market for a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case dates back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck compla@@ ined to each other and took possession of laboratory work , followed by Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are running clearance work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton published its tax return for 2015 on Friday , resulting in a USD 10.@@ 75 million in@@ comes and an effective tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % for the President &apos;s nomin@@ ee of the Democrats and her husband .
in 2015 , Clinton &apos;s USD 1 million donated $ 5.1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton ended up with USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ mption Shar@@ es ; the former Foreign Minister announced an income of USD 3 million from Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster publishing house for her book on her term of office in the State Department .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for vice @-@ president , Sen@@ ator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton published his tax declarations of the last ten years .
they paid an effective Swiss tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Clin@@ tons Camp@@ aig@@ n Hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false pron@@ oun@@ cements and re@@ trac@@ ers regarding his previous promises to publish his tax returns .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax statements even though they are not oblig@@ ated to do so by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have declared a tax check by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the move , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign hel@@ per Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , regarding the publication of the Demo@@ crat candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ ump Special Ad@@ vis@@ ers , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the tax inspections are not completed .
among other things , Tr@@ umps critics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 , Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal raises questions about assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business units and various other links , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already top@@ pled the issue and posted a video on the Internet on Friday in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump calls on his tax return to be published .
on Thursday she spoke also during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ ig@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reported that during the 1990s , Tr@@ ump paid no or very little taxes for two years , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday .
federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton provides a scheme that is named after billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , which would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in the past week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away developed industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate here , Tr@@ ump to meet a meeting to exchange their tax returns .
Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a tax check of the I@@ RS and Tr@@ ump had &quot; fear &quot; before voters and not before tax authorities .
Clinton &apos;s campaign has returned tax returns to 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , aver@@ aged an effective German tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 40@@ ,5 % .
the tax return of the 2015 Clin@@ tons showed that they only received USD 100 of their income as wages , unlike most of the Americans .
their main money investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and income from USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed .

con@@ doms with ch@@ illi powder , Fire@@ works promote D@@ ancing ani@@ as Ele@@ ph@@ ant Protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going to inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with chi@@ ds .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which already had the idea for years , intensified its promotion with US nature conservation , by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania , using a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crops without viol@@ ating animals .
previously , many sp@@ ears used to defend themselves .
Friday is the World Trade Day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... tool@@ kit , we could observe a change in their attitude within these communities , being much more confident that they can stop the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a torch and the bubbles in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ch@@ illi @-@ cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ch@@ illi powder mixed with earth is packed into a con@@ dom together with a fire@@ work body , whose end is turned to the ignition cord .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a knob and spra@@ ys fine dust on ch@@ illi powder into the air .
a breath is usually sufficient to ch@@ ase the elephant .
one last possibility is a th@@ row@@ er , who shoots a wood@@ turning plant into the air , causing a loud , bright explosion .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle , we welcome new tra@@ des@@ people , but at this location in an exposed position on the banks of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director dis@@ integrates Berlin hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; call - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media record after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin had not listed an Israeli pre @-@ election because Arab guests had &quot; requested &quot; according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his anno@@ y@@ ance at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel at the hotel &apos;s list of countries .
the country , however , was not listed between the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sent it forth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel staff said the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind that was even more fur@@ y in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election be er@@ ased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Lanz@@ mann employee was quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; big shame , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were app@@ alled and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to draw &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a rather big resonance on the internet , where people called the whole thing a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of them subordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indul@@ ge in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alleged promp@@ ts of Arab guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was said in another article stating that the hotel , which is situated on the noble Kur@@ für@@ sten@@ damm , stands near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all accus@@ ations and called the incident an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ olog@@ ised &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct statement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to not include Israel in the quick selection list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police deplo@@ ys tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets to protest Brazilian students
students met in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police installed tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which caused the police to use rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about the plans .
according to the Gover@@ nor of the federal state of Sao Paulo Ger@@ ald Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are converted to save money .
some of the protest participants were scre@@ aming gra@@ ff@@ iti against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
the recent protests erup@@ ted several days after demonstr@@ ators went into the streets to support the suspended president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dismissed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the exchange rate between Moscow and Te@@ hr@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the previous year .
since international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest shown in Russian companies in shops in the country has been growing strongly , shared by the ambassador .
Russian companies take up existing ties with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the further commercial expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that in the first five months of 2016 , the trade @-@ turnover between Russia and Iran grew by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and was $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and tot@@ alled $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade break was achieved through deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan is a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
last year , Russian foreign representatives accounted for some 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travelling vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries concerning the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it could be said that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia are broken from last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who have preserved the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .
looking for witnesses : re@@ covering beverage market in forest @-@ br@@ anded oil
a rob@@ ber@@ y was practi@@ sed on Thursday evening on the drink market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
in the presence of a gun , three dark dressed people who had m@@ um@@ med their faces from the staff of the drink ar@@ ctic demanded the release of cash and then fled first on foot and then presumably with a silver @-@ coloured VW Golf .
the police do not share how much money has been captured .
the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 metres , thus relatively small .
the beverage market is accessible and poorly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
after the assault , the perpetr@@ ators have to travel in direction Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and escaped from the gravel car park located opposite the park entrance road with the silver @-@ colored car , possibly towards B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .

Nag@@ old : play and fun during summer@@ time
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and you@@ ths of the social pedago@@ gical day group / social group work of the child protection association Nag@@ old with their supervis@@ ors during their summer break in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
the life @-@ joyful group was quartered in the quiet area of Lei@@ feld Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle during the first week of school .
several day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand , a visit to the stro@@ king zoo was about to be saved .
on the other hand to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery .
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about the daily life and food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days the group enjoyed themselves at the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited to jump , swimming and plan@@ ing .
the culinary delights of children and car@@ ers with their own appe@@ tiz@@ ers such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese .
workshops were made , beautiful pieces of jewellery made of pearls and stones , or made of wood , a Roman @-@ Mill @-@ Game .
other highlights of the leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings on the fire and the final &quot; Color@@ ful evening . &quot;
on the day of the journey home , the sun laugh@@ ed and the children and you@@ ths returned home satisfied .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the Gate of Mer@@ cy
the Altar Bo@@ ys from the pastoral care unit E@@ bay @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
four stages were tac@@ kled together .
in order to bridge the time to the next Rom@@ s@@ lei@@ gh ride of all the Mini@@ stries in two years , the St. Anna district of mini@@ stries has decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgri@@ m migration .
various pilgrimage destinations have been tested and one finally decided for the Ep@@ is@@ cop@@ al city of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy .
16 Min@@ is from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt , set themselves in the way .
in the evening before , Father Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ gri@@ mage and informed the Pil@@ gri@@ ms .
from Hor@@ b there was driven by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Münster Our Lady stands and so the pilgri@@ m route was started from Münster .
each day and evening the individual day@@ trips were framed by a short impulse with various prayers , songs and writing texts .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is visited field crosses , chap@@ els or churches always to sing together a song from a specially made pilgri@@ m song .
for the nights , par@@ ishes of the local par@@ ishes were available .
at the stage destinations Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller cared for a tasty and strengthening dinner and breakfast .
we continued on the second day via Fur@@ tw@@ angen in Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
the next day , the stage after St. Peter , which was the most stren@@ uous route , had to be lowered about 500 metres in altitude and then climbed up again .
the earned reward was a joint barbecue at the bathing pond in the evening .
after the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter it went to the final stage to Freiburg .
the Min@@ is was visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy in the afternoon at the Freiburg cathedral and walked through the gate of mercy .
with a small impulse God was thank@@ ed here .
in the evening mass in Münster , the Min@@ is welcomed on the pilgrimage site were greeted by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t .
after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the city of B@@ reis@@ gau .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
at the end all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked .
Scot@@ s@@ man Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Br@@ ite Gold won for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last night in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int in Vel@@ o@@ rom in Rio for glory when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glas@@ gow embark@@ ed on the anch@@ or@@ age that his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself an affair . the J@@ PG made the legend proud when he rush@@ ed home to visit New Zealand &apos;s favor@@ ites .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago while Ho@@ y took the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place at the London railway world championships in March despite the appearance of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as Hin@@ des appeared .
Ho@@ ys retirement generated a gap which Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner prevailed in the qualification rounds an Olympic champion , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his lap , Hin@@ des was almost back , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation in which Hin@@ des went in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and , above all , Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des when they got on the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glas@@ gow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am only here to do my best and make a name for myself .
we set up an olymp@@ ic record in the final round and defeated the world champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 at the side of Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ des admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the road .
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no objection from England &apos;s rival .
with such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ des said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole GB of flags on the grand@@ stand like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we went so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the past five months , we expect successful five days in the bicycle rom .
with the form Kenn@@ ys it &apos;s in the realm of possible that he has repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a contest .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for the British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be the same by Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a little lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ des said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometre race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , which won Gold in 2012 in London , was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
he had argued with representatives before the qualification yesterday , when officials called him to measure his height .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued tomorrow and ended , Laura Des@@ p@@ ite , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ ga@@ vie in the world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team relies on its strong railway team to dominate the mid period of the Olympic Games and to bring a flock of med@@ als .
after a truly exceptional representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , expectations for Rio have been shut down .
Dra@@ mas played in the background , so the res@@ ignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex and mo@@ b@@ bing alleg@@ ations as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the cycle of velo@@ drome , it looks quite as if the now legendary reputation of G@@ Bs , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , could be repeated .
the future of the Port@@ land melting plant due to the lifting of the energy yield
the future of the Al@@ uminum sleeve of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake , as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract , thereby raising all supply contracts , as the supplying energy company announced .
this step followed the decision of the Government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , not to grant any further subsidies for the operation of the plant .
a subsi@@ dy established for 20 years is scheduled to exp@@ ire in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the Al@@ coa plant in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct and indirect - could be endangered in closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects since the melting process uses around 10 percent of the total power generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 , Al@@ coa terminated the Point Henry melting plant , which last year led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant .
Al@@ coa &apos;s melting plant in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
this step follows the years of speculation as to the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the facility is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p are holding smaller shares .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means another physical demand for electricity by melting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should have come into force from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from this point , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in the financial year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on income on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L stated that it had already depreci@@ ated the value of the Tre@@ aties in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of a termination . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the enam@@ el or to ensure power to melt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not interfere . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said that in 2010 it had concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , who should have entered into force from November this year , even if it is still an explanation why it has res@@ ig@@ ned from the contract .
analysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of Port@@ land melting plant in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near New@@ castle .
in reference to analysts &apos; statements at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land will consume around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts of power per year and about 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity per year .
should both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand in the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and it wouldn &apos;t be good for us as a generating set , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ erin and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner clan , Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran to Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this powder brought me to tears , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or just Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans ) , shared reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner family ( except for the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the all@@ all@@ est show bi@@ z un@@ cle and producers of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) .
this represents the most c@@ lich@@ é act of almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls participate somehow in this publicity .
with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has begun .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim might have beaten her in terms of the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the magazine &apos;s September issue is a league for itself .
the September edition is the most commonly sold issue of the year for vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference that is more like an illustrated book than a fashion magazine , the edition draws a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut fashion@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the tome 6@@ 15 pages of advertising ) .
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover star is so eag@@ erly awa@@ ited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still leak before official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties who mo@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models , celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar @-@ winner and Di@@ or @-@ brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even with the little chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls below the former category , she is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or young@@ sters of today who know how to shoot a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if everything applies to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers likes success not everyone .
with her reality TV story , J@@ enny &apos;s position in the world of fashion was always something ten@@ se .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed her and called her &quot; the mi@@ st@@ let@@ oe of the moment . &quot;
these feelings cooked up again when the message came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but to walk around on the disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure seems to pass by at the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ ming of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
they and all their sisters are selling pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her paintings by Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the W@@ TV magazine .
and in her free time she is seen in Reality TV . presumably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
municipal law centres annually have 160@@ ,000 people
more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s resource centres are rejected annually by the municipal law centres , while the industry is preparing for the effects of further mi@@ tigation on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land there are already three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ u@@ sions and the like - in their search for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ ly util@@ ised , are ready for further cuts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as of June next year , it is fores@@ een that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Director of Que@@ es@@ land &apos;s Joint Chi@@ efs of Justice , James Far@@ rel@@ l , said that the last survey of the National Union of Community Law Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people have been dismissed each year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only be worse without repe@@ ating the decision of the Federal Government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centres are chron@@ ically under@@ funded , meaning thousands of people from key services that you need to be rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relations , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been wrong@@ ly dismissed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need .
as of June 2017 , the federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent , which means that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
we urge the General Prosecutor and Justice Minister and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately lift these short@@ cuts so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems .
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community centres and their customers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign accused after employee o@@ sten@@ si@@ bly pulled out weapon
new York : Donald Tr@@ umps Camp@@ aig@@ n was accused of alleged in@@ activity after being told that their campaign manager for North Carolina was shooting a bul@@ let weapon for an employee in February , while they were in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an Indi@@ ct@@ ment filed on Wednesday in the State Court of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this federal state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i claimed to have been waiting for months that the matter would be internally regulated before he realised that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Camp@@ aig@@ n leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulled a gun , put his right finger on the trigger , and ra@@ ped the barrel in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i in his indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after compla@@ ining about the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i stated that at least four other people had had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he was charged with the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons do not have to be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate triggered a tur@@ mo@@ il when he said a crowd in North Carolina said that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton was elected and judges should appoint . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the campaign made it clear that the media had torn out his words from the context and that he would not inc@@ ite violence .
B@@ ordin@@ is complaint demands compensation from the campaign to breach the duty of care and Philip for bodily injury and permanent mental harm .
the press spokesperson from Hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached for an opinion .
attempts to contact Philip were just as wrong .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , announces that Phil@@ lip is no longer a member of the campaign .
responding to calls from his consulting firm , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted .
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , Donald Tr@@ ump , has so far conducted a controversial campaign .
the procedure is B@@ ordin@@ i v. Donald J. Tr@@ ump For President Inc . , 16 @-@ CS @-@ 14@@ 300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) .
Berlin / Schwer@@ in : pol@@ l before the elections : losing the SPD and the CD@@ U
during the upcoming elections in the Federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) considerable losses for the governing party SPD and CD@@ U are notable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to go@@ vern in the north , it is not possible after the survey values in Berlin .
in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to be the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD jump@@ ed from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party was just ahead of CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is controversial between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left came to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the Land@@ tag .
despite light losses , the Green Party hes@@ itated by 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) again into the Schwer@@ iner Land@@ tag .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented in the Land@@ tag with 3 per cent respectively .
according to the poll@@ s in Berlin , the SPD &apos;s election result would only be 23 percent ( 2011 election : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
it still remains behind the Gre@@ ens by 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but in front of the left with 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented at 14 per cent for the first time in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , whereas in contrast to 2011 , the pirates would miss the move .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
email and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , Nokia Communic@@ ator arrived on the market .
today &apos;s success@@ ors dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thicker and bigger , so it was not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was rather cl@@ ums@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory initially reached eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would range today for approximately two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; occurred exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros , fans can still buy the equipment on the internet , but they somehow come from the stone age of the internet age .
20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; office in the West liner format &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone was able to receive a lot for these standards : SMS and emails could be sent and received , even by fax , the communic@@ ator could be reached .
even accessing web pages was possible via HTML @-@ browser , albeit slow .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
quite proud was the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros .
the average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 Euro in 2015 .
nobody was able to suspect in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything has changed .
smart phones are a success story though not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s mobile phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster and was eventually sold and handled by Microsoft .
the market today is domin@@ ating vendors , who all came much later than Nokia .
being online anywhere and everywhere is everyday life for very many people .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
about 1.4 billion devices were sold , Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units alone .
worldwide sales of the equipment are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running shops of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies .
an entire industry has been created around the smartphone in the meantime .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market was only at the beginning of 2007 , then Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced on the Mac @-@ World the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet communic@@ ator , all @-@ by @-@ touch screen easy to use .
the triumph of Apple began , and today the iPhone is the most important product of the company .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had a look .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after the invention .
on average every German looks today 88 times a day on his cell phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must all learn to get the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of personnel in the Siemens executive board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just as in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities , we will already have 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips , 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of the expansion He@@ ath@@ rows is too great .
I have been told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be flo@@ cking on the world stage .
the two @-@ leg@@ ged people were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question asked .
like the Olympic Games He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for single an infrastructure project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enlargement is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in atmospheric growth and leave a legacy of skills and jobs both around the airport and in the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , who has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - the five years as a result of the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to the T2 , which was built in the middle of the world &apos;s two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
London &apos;s 2012 games were a great success for GB and I am confident that He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz and M@@ ouse Play &quot; for ad blocking
for companies that make money online using online advertising , attempts to b@@ ypass ad blocking are the same as a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad block@@ ings on its desktop side , Ad@@ block Plus released a blog post in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop side would change the encoding for its ads in order to make it difficult to recognise the recognition of which part of the advertisement is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to circum@@ vent the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this type of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her @-@ Fi@@ ght between the line @-@ up open source community and the hang@@ ers has been underway since the invention of ad blo@@ wers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has joined the fight is a strong indication of how worried repor@@ ters have become the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ j@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people use advertisement cookies around the globe , almost four times as much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion active users who access Facebook about their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of the advertising revenues of Facebook .
the company said that mobile ad blo@@ wers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m shared a spokes@@ man .
advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a large amount of revenue , so Facebook is re@@ warding the investment of such a step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad preferences tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give people more control over their advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block would be wor@@ rying about new filters , because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook spokes@@ man in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt tool so we focus instead on developing tools like Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into people &apos;s hands .
woman who committed suicide on Swiss expres@@ s@@ way
the victim was lying in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call on witnesses after a woman was transferred to a highway in the early morning hours on Thursday during a suspected suicide of several vehicles .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman lay down in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of despair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , said the police in Vau@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 , who was driven by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , said the police , calling them as well as any witness to the incident to report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investig@@ ative process was opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , Gil@@ les Hof@@ st@@ etter shared with Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers will not be held responsible .
in each of the two cases , in which a person walking in the dark on the highway , it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian flows in the middle of the night on the highway as it was called in the newspaper .
last year , a co@@ p was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent hom@@ icide , after she over@@ took and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street , took the judgment .
the court noted that the polic@@ ew@@ oman - who had responded to an emergency call -- went to a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; perfectly exceptional and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably once inhab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus with tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate researchers .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere could once have re@@ pu@@ di@@ ated similar conditions .
scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , straw@@ berry @-@ like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably has more dry areas than de Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to house life and protected from rapid evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus is exposed to its daily side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the sun &apos;s heat .
the result is average temperatures which are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously assumed by planet researchers .
although it was once hab@@ itable , Venus -- over the course of several billion years - was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
their oceans evapor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was blown away by ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus as we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy returns as trainer of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy reti@@ res on Thursday as a coach and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to a low right of co @-@ determination during the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association is immediately looking for a new coach .
&quot; over the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement .
during the summer , I thought about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , it needed it and bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organisation .
he must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are not met at the moment .
Sak@@ ic , who was recru@@ ited by Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , Patrick informed me about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all he has done for our organization and wish him the best for the future .
Roy has been awarded the best trainer of the league during his debut season at the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Award .
he led the club to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the season in each of the last two years .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the game for a second Wild@@ card spot at the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy has won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal and A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ th@@ ee@@ oil workers resume talks , resume strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour disputes relating to wages for the North Sea workers will be suspended while all the parties for a new round of talks are seated at the table , negoti@@ ators said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the Oil @-@ Field Services Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ cally carried out on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Wood Group , as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT Trade Uni@@ ons , can confirm that we have agreed to restart the current strike process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will stop some full day sessions in the coming weeks that will start at the beginning of next year to restart the problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , the Wood Group has shortened the rates of its contra@@ cti@@ cs in the North Sea by around 9 per cent on the basis of negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 percent decline for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts will give the company the required space to get through the market down@@ turn .
shell has dismissed thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its meg@@ a@@ merger with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure because of the lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that has been reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the greatest work disputes that took place in the North Sea for a generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and across the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected to spend new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler world teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers gather the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates under the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars rotate in star @-@ houses to different rates as well as in which context the rotation @-@ time periods with planetary emergence are standing .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star enh@@ ancers , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light years distant from the earth .
many stars in this cluster of stars , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , are reaching adul@@ thood .
they are now turning fastest .
at peak rotation rates , these mature stars rep@@ el large quantities of star@@ ches .
since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star ages , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recogni@@ zing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star@@ ry -- like sun@@ spots .
the newest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars revol@@ ve more slowly than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars rotate at slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
as the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rotation rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , both younger and older , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is still much to find out about how the How , When and Why stars slow down their rotation rates and hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the P@@ lei@@ ades of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star
the tears ran with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the US bas@@ eball star in best days from Base to Base .
after his emotional res@@ ignation , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will wear the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es for the last time on 12 August against T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say good@@ bye &quot; to both , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star game participant of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was voted the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature , under a 10 @-@ year treaty , has been giving him $ 27 million annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will serve as consultant and youth coach - with full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was rewarded with performance for a long time .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle marine ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two other bas@@ eball players have similar values in the most important statistics .
but the 41 year old is not likely to be accepted into the Hall of Gl@@ ory of the Bas@@ eball .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because so successfully Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was in the field , so controversial is his appearance outside of the place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star participated in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 banned ster@@ oids . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was blocked for 211 games due to involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal by the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the prime suspect to have been receiving an anti @-@ aging clinic in Southern Florida for years .
after a legal dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league could have done me a favor in 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said sweet@@ ly back then . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even his farewell days are not no@@ is@@ eless .
while many bas@@ eball legends still get the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez frequently had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes trying to win any game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and told the circumstances with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , got sympathy for fans of Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Erz@@ riv@@ alen in Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the fans che@@ ered at the 4 : 9 defeat against Rodri@@ gu@@ ez &apos;s team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
caught up : Wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio is not allowed to start because of a positive dop@@ ing test .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing events .
a wi@@ ped ath@@ lete would have won almost one medal .
before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing events have become the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
Chinese flo@@ ats Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter @-@ obstacle @-@ runner Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested and expelled in Brazil - immediately before the start of the already critically acclaimed athle@@ tics competitions this news came to an end .
in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de was demonstrated last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
the International Women &apos;s Court ( CA@@ S ) confirmed their expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old finished fourth in the fin@@ als over 100 m Butter@@ fly , only 0.@@ 09 seconds missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en should have participated in the performances of more than 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) applied for the opening of the B @-@ Trial and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very seriously and requires full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will work together with the International Criminal Court ( CA@@ S ) and will accept the judgement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first time in history is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio the news se@@ eping through the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said to Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Ath@@ le@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O should act in the forbidden substance .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova was suspended for the time being , according to B@@ NT , the B test should already have been positive .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Boy@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately reported to the Ath@@ eni@@ ans word .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We Bulgarian are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ loaded nation must not participate in Rio .
on Friday the case was also known as &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski , &quot; the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positive for three days as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon .
both deny the intake , but both must not start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the athletes start , the Dan@@ ek@@ ova case is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the World Association IA@@ AF has banned the entire Russian team up to an exception because of systematic dop@@ ing , even the Ken@@ yan generation produces a lot of bad news in Rio .
in addition , the previous agreements in China caused serious disputes also between athletes .
so the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t res@@ or@@ ted to the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ ley li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium more than 200 m of Fre@@ estyle , I want to commit myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t on the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also at the heart of a debate with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing fraud , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun had been tested positive for the stimul@@ ant tri@@ met@@ azi@@ de in the Chinese championships in 2014 , but only had to reti@@ re for a three month period .
data Com@@ ic : so per@@ fi@@ de , h@@ ack@@ ers black@@ mail their ran@@ som
developers of black@@ mail malware are currently target@@ ing companies - and they are successful .
according to a recent survey by the malware protection specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes unter 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany 40 percent of the surv@@ eyed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once , partially several victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies had already been the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som required by the perpetr@@ ators in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data again .
according to the reports of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize in attacks on corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potential to obtain ran@@ som is significantly higher than for private users .
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes of chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot;
in 2008 most of the malware have been designed to send advertising .
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks was terri@@ fying quickly over the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once active on the computer of a victim , it searches for recently changed files such as Word , Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ ts the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the recei@@ v@@ ables of black@@ mail presses .
to get the final breakdown code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin .
however , where private users find the personal photo database at stake , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production stops .
accordingly , the damage occurs when a Ran@@ som@@ ware strikes .
22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses through Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to cancel their business operations completely , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always tell the victims : pay not , you only support the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay will receive their data again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for managers it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetr@@ ators in the face of a stand@@ still in operation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the h@@ ack@@ ers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure examined the user @-@ winning areas and contact with the black@@ mail@@ ers and come to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators actually try to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain their victims via chat , how they can pay per Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t free example files .
and if private people are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies have to negotiate hard and pay five dig@@ its to return their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potential high and relatively risk @-@ free gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware pressing , the h@@ ack@@ ers become more and more professional and share their work , says Safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski of the anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware circa within a week . &quot;
it is more likely that these are three or four people .
the program@@ mers sell their malware in the form of a software building block to the actual black@@ mail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; malware &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kits were created by the malware themselves , advice and additional tools for a unique fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; delivery includes a calibration tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski says .
the black@@ mail presses are then looking for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
you log in one of the forums in the underground , bu@@ ys the set from a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is made per infected host .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the criminals employ sp@@ amm@@ ers with dis@@ semination , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies that better secure their data .
more than 50 percent of the companies IT leaders in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust to be able to rep@@ el ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful black@@ mail , the offen@@ ders thre@@ aten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes of chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the type of data , the damage potential is much higher than before .
in the future , the perpetr@@ ators could , in future , take on completely new goals on the Internet of Things .
at the Def@@ con &apos;s conference , safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of winter , the activation of such a blocked heat could well be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpetr@@ ators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .

although the HR @-@ V is only 1.@@ 60 m high , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear .
the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit side is falling apart .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a boot of 4@@ 53 l for raised and 10@@ 26 liters for inver@@ ted back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seats of the rear bench can be folded up like a cinema chair and thus offer storage space , which is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling .
the trunk can be loaded properly , but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the 1.6 @-@ liter diesel engine with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
he should do his job a little bit qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4,@@ 7 l / 100 km is encouraging .
there is another power@@ train : a 1.5 @-@ litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering should be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment in the tested top variant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the security system belongs to the City emergency braking assistant ( working until speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates , because when maneu@@ vering , it evalu@@ ates many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent controller responds to the traffic sign detection and throt@@ tles the speed if necessary .
but the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , App integration and more .
two US@@ B@@ - and one HDMI @-@ jack lie under the arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit aw@@ k@@ ward to achieve .
the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the petrol engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emissions standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
airline is not liable : crash on passenger bridge
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is conceivable only in the case of hazards that are typical of aviation .
the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff had broken his knee cap when it fell .
but the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the judgment .
the airline did not have to pay compensation to the man .
illness : when the Organ@@ izer pays
after their trip , sick holi@@ day@@ makers only get money back if the cause of the disease is beyond doubt in the hotel .
this is only the case if more than ten percent of guests have shown the same symptoms .
in the case of the case a family had suffered from diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their leave .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their illness brought back the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a defective treatment plant that supposedly polluted the sea@@ water .
the family considered that the trip was lacking - and compla@@ ined against the organizer .
the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs did not succeed in court .
the treatment plant was indeed defective .
however , the organizer only learned about it shortly before the departure of the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to assume that sea@@ water was fine .
so he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , so the judgement .
no im@@ puri@@ ties were found in the samples of the water .
the illness of several hotel guests - possibly through con@@ ta@@ gion with each other - belongs to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
after the violent acts committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks .
the state must be pru@@ dent and decisi@@ vely re@@ acted to acts of terrorism .
it is certain that our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and division .
we will not grant this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if criminals have to leave the country more quickly , this increases the security and also strengthens the people &apos;s consent for refugee policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère plans to implement the proposals until the 2017 elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of a four @-@ digit magnitude over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
promoting terrorism must again be under penalty .
video surveillance is to be improved , the right of arms to be amended so that especially the purchase of weapons on the Internet is ham@@ pered .
the recently widely discussed duty of sec@@ rec@@ y for physicians is to be maintained according to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in dialogue with the medical fr@@ at@@ ernity , he wants to look for solutions that could be reduced by endanger@@ ing citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , with a view of psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act a ra@@ dic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister considers a better social support necessary .
teachers should be better prepared to deal with trau@@ mati@@ sed people .
in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , De Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the deployment of cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD leader Gabriel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything contributing to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior spoke clearly against action .
&quot; this was a sla@@ p for the sni@@ pers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; said Gabriel the newspapers of the spark media group ( Friday ) .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double nationality .
as a general prohibition of full @-@ veil , it is problematic to be constitu@@ tionally problematic .
you can &apos;t ban all that you reject , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
it is possible to talk about rules such as in road traffic or for witnesses in court .
green leader Sim@@ one Peter accused the minister that he wanted to simulate action and action with new anti @-@ terrorist acts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet pro@@ verb@@ s and a tightening of the right to stay bring people in this country no more security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway feeder
it st@@ umps regularly on the circum@@ ference road - here &apos;s a picture of November .
but this is to change : the legal dispute is to be extended .
this is good news for all drivers who are in traffic on the ambient street every evening in traffic jams , when driving over the motorway , feeder ( A 43 ) .
the road construction will be extended next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer Street and the exit Wes@@ er Straße at 700 meters .
drivers can then go straight from the Hammer Street to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic is getting early , which improves the overall sequence on the busy section of the federal road 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder is annoying for drivers between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the back@@ log reaches the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ e path and sometimes beyond .
this is why the needle hole on the B 51 is just before the exit Wes@@ er Straße .
from this point onwards traffic is only directed one lane over the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built back a good three @-@ four@@ ths years ago .
the reason for this was that static calculations had shown that the bridge could no longer have the necessary load capacity , in order to absorb the heavy @-@ duty traffic two @-@ lane .
how long this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the connected daily traffic will continue , the competent national company cannot say .
however , it has to be reck@@ oned with years , because the bridge has an official rest @-@ life up to 20@@ 34 .
in order to extend the legal down@@ turn , the state company deliberately chose the weaker time during the school holidays because it was to be expected with disabilities .
the traffic will be tra@@ cked on the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural Travel : cultural offers for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ ima &apos; s and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project .
the N@@ ima &apos; s association enables young people with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule children &apos;s home has visited an award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the boy theatre Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by the N@@ ima &apos;s association , 19 pupils visited the st@@ aging in the Small House between 11 and 15 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , has offered schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project .
most of the students of the class came from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Mu@@ enster between September 2015 and March 2016 and speak little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations it was possible for them to follow the course of action , thus the press release of the Junge Theater Münster .
the N@@ ima &apos; s association , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ chen@@ bach , and the Junge Theater will work together as part of a music theatre project in the coming season .
between October and December young people with and without escape and migration background will have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
special offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theat@@ rical mediation are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; continues .
in view of the increased numbers of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of weather
the weather has made the shooting star Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany on the night a line through the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain to watch the astronom@@ ical spectacle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we will see many shooting stars in the sky .
the shooting stars are per@@ sei@@ ds , which are one of the fastest shooting stars with 2@@ 16@@ ,000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
in the evening you roll around forever , at night you lie awake for hours , in the morning it is not possible to think of sleep far before the alarm bells .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleeping problems or sleeping disorders express ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many causes behind them , says Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , member of the board of the German Society for Sle@@ ep and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
but the in@@ som@@ nia is what you see for the time being , so an in@@ let and sleep distur@@ b@@ ance .
it is precisely the sleeping experience that many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or insufficient , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the Executive Board of the German GP Association , with practice in Var@@ el in Lower Saxony .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind it can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also drugs .
not in@@ frequently is the sleeping disorder an expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is common in the case of depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ cute . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it may be that different factors thre@@ aten each other .
for example , those who have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc can sleep well , wake up every two to three hours and may start thinking about everyday problems and worries .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should sleep distur@@ b the doctor ?
those who do not sleep well for a period of one month in at least three nights per week should go to the doctor , throw away .
the impairment can look quite different : you are worn down , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulty with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or bodily complaints such as stomach or head@@ aches .
in order to allevi@@ ate sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , it is important to find out their causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or even drugs - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks .
in Germany , low @-@ level medical practitioners hardly exist , emphasizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medicine centre at the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
for this reason , in case of trouble sleeping , one should first contact the family doctor , says the shooting range .
this can be clari@@ fied with studies whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep and what will happen ?
for example , in case of snor@@ ing with respiratory problems , in case of sick day@@ time , sleep@@ wal@@ kers , or if you do not find the cause of a sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , Fi@@ fa explains .
it is not necessary to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please do not make a nap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ fa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the cl@@ adding you go to bed at its normal time .
besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ go@@ g@@ gles , a chest strap and a fe@@ eler on the finger .
in addition , a camera on the ceiling shows the sleeping end .
how can those affected get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws for better sleep .
you can &apos;t sleep long in bed , do not sleep long in bed , do not watch TV for falling asleep , avoid alcohol and do not watch the clock at night - then you start counting immediately , and that is quite and not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp with missing med@@ als in swimming has to offer
the former German float Markus Dei@@ bler has commented on Facebook for the dis@@ ap@@ pointing cut of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he took gold for the first time at the world championships in Doh@@ a and at the same time set up his first world record .
the former DS@@ V @-@ ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler has now set himself in front of his ex @-@ team@@ mates in front of his ex @-@ team@@ mates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic champion receives 20,000 € bonus and a jungle king of € 150@@ ,000 no one should be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the transport system in swimming sport is bad , but dop@@ ing controls are very good .
as a result , we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look so closely at the topic of dop@@ ing or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be reported already nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
that &apos;s exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you cannot control a certain amount of time before World Cup / OS by independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A , you are not allowed to participate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the election Hamburger , who now runs an ice cream par@@ lor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de of Bag@@ gage Speci@@ es arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
the police of the Düsseldorf police were arrested on Thursday by two women and two men aged 50 to 61 .
as a band the suspect had committed several bags of hand@@ ker@@ chief and luggage .
at 21.@@ 30 p.m. civil servants in the area of the airport of D@@ us@@ sel@@ dorf again recognized a gang known to the polic@@ emen from past theft events .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since mid @-@ July and were in a collective , work@@ able and especially professional manner .
the Speci@@ alists of the Crime Com@@ miss@@ ariat 34 can prove four acts to the thi@@ eves , who had travelled to Germany specifically for the off@@ ence of criminal off@@ ences .
they had spent a total of more than 15.000 Euro .
old buildings , a few lime trees , in between still some cob@@ ble@@ stones : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in looks not like at first sight , but the police counts them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if you walk along the road from east to west , one passes by play@@ grounds , a refresh@@ ed kinder@@ garten and a Bi@@ ol@@ aden .
someone &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed on the facade of a grey house .
in contrast to a Li@@ dl that will soon be demol@@ ished , it is already being built : by 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; articles about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the competent real estate firm Friedrichsha@@ in calls , are , however , pre@@ fers to be bil@@ led with burning cars over the last few weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rent contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and used for events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin @-@ based inner sen@@ ator Henkel has spoken several times for a hard action of the police against the project , the area called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after having cleared the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers , on 22 June , the police pat@@ rol official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , locked out parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
in the meantime , construction workers were working on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal , and a day later , police and construction workers mar@@ ched under the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the street acts peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the pav@@ ement in front of houses in the sun , others are talking pre@@ m sp@@ ät@@ i .
in the immediate vicinity of the building projects there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
left @-@ hand violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who has three children here , are mainly irrit@@ ated by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who wished for a majority of police protection from the v@@ and@@ ali@@ zing left .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police do between house occup@@ ants and their neighbors , apparently does not exist .
Friedrichsha@@ in , in East Berlin , was actually a traditional working @-@ class district , which today , compared to the rest of the city , has a low average income and a high risk of poverty .
in 1990 , numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied , among them nearly the entire Main@@ zer Straße in the vicinity of the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer was evacu@@ ated under large police regulations in a ver@@ itable street battle , many of the projects in the Rig@@ a@@ er were leg@@ alized and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago .
at the same time , in recent years , the city district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and sel@@ ections from all over the world : with them residents from East Germany and former occup@@ ants now share their Kie@@ z .
this is also noticeable in the r@@ ents , which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are being attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them on raised pan@@ es or freshly painted facades , which were thrown with paint bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year as often coinci@@ ded with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason why not all neighbours look at this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as personal injury , according to statistics , are almost exclusively directed against police officers .
most of the crimes perpet@@ u@@ ate property damage , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
there is no talk of in@@ security for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rented house beside the controversial 94 in a rented house for 17 years .
when it comes to violence , it is more important : people in the 94 are their neighbours who are certainly not .
even the famous burning cars are no longer there in the Rig@@ a@@ er anymore .
for the architect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here you help one another , live together on the street and get more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is consciously pulled into the streets of Riga - and has remained .
this is why it was so important that the residents get their way back : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly demand interpretation sovereignty over the bor@@ ough .
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street will continue to be taken away from them : fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former buildings displac@@ ing the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are actually con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many people here - people who are not so good are living here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can absolutely not appro@@ ve of violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what to do if you never listen to someone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , including the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding of drawn @-@ out who anno@@ y themselves about color bombs : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
those who draw near should be aware of it - just like someone who pul@@ ls into a pub area , can complain badly about noise .

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee commission@@ er
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee commission@@ er for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social pedago@@ gue supports the team of Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
it sees itself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working groups for refugees , administration , authorities and anyone else involved .
Reg@@ ine client of the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is there , the ei@@ ving Woll@@ mil@@ k@@ sau , which has a problem above all .
this meant a few - less ridi@@ culous than on the multitude of tasks required - meant when the administration wanted to leave the site .
we were looking for an administrative field with a talent for languages and people , combined with many years of experience in the field of social work , namely an egg @-@ reli@@ ant wool mel@@ ange .
but administrative work is not its central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le writes .
above all , it is about organization , work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position limited to three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are great and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems .
new containers will soon be placed in the Was@@ en@@ straße
a serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized .
the local authorities are responsible for the connection .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the costs of the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility varies from the district office to the municipality and the job center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time .
de facto , the administration does not find private apartments .
so far , it does not work , if one depends on private dwell@@ ings , according to Deu@@ sch@@ le .
that is why communities need to be humili@@ ated , as it is so beautiful .
so , new containers will soon be placed in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine client and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent residence , there are intern@@ ships , apprentices@@ hips , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be slaugh@@ tered or furnished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more places would be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many work in the building yard or help master craftsmen , do not @-@ for @-@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
it hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external impact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no occupational therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
the day needs a firm structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so it needs offers like sports , contacts with locals and above all language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so here also jump management and volunteers .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the proceedings is a problem .
they need to explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can make sense of time , for example with language courses .
whoever develops the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , can &apos;t work and be useless , he will never integrate himself .
the clear majority was motivated .
but there are problems also , says customer hon@@ estly , &quot; people with whom nothing works . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and client is therefore always motiv@@ ating others to motiv@@ ate others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : do the two after the recent events fear ra@@ dic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some may call na@@ ï@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a residual risk could and would not be excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these incidents also concern the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were afraid that the attack@@ ers would complete them completely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main and honorary officials have to look out for activities in the region and in the region .
they have always in the background that soon a new impetus could come to refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a fron@@ tier ?
to answer this question clearly , politics shi@@ r@@ ks .
actually it is unfair to put them on site .
