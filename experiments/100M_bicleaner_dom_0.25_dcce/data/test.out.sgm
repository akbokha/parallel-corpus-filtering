<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues visited a bit of variety with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden pyramid of sport" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes the horses remembered their evening, they drove home to the feed-troughs in the fast gallop home.</seg>
<seg id="7">A kilometer at this pace, I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says.</seg>
<seg id="9">And so the riding career ended up again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament wins - was again close to horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He had his family run over the plant of the ALRV on a horse he didn't even boar for photography.</seg>
<seg id="12">This was the first time in Aachen, and therefore also at the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the course of a small gala, the German sports team presented the Golden Gymnastics pyramid to the man from Anhausen.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards for the likeable athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silver Laurel leaf, Champions Tour-Player of the Year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen had already adjourned him.</seg>

<seg id="21">For decades Langer has been supporting the offspring.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "with 15 other outstanding sportsmen, the double US master winner was added to the" "" "Hall of Fame of German Sports" "" "on Saturday." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">These are the athletes of Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the gymnast of Eberhard Gienger, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Reuderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthum der Handballer Erhard Wunderlich.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trumps Economic Policy Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential candidates are not one of the tax and energy policies as well as in a fundamental issue.</seg>
<seg id="4">The difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">Who, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns against how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will drive down regulations massively, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has to fulfil certain tasks, it has to offer disadvantaged opportunities and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why the taxes for the rich would be increased, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the subject infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "in which must be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost wordless." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic applicant is even announcing the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the state-critical teapy wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "so on Trump there could be internal discussions." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive coal mining in the US again.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, the Parisian climate protection agreement he wants to quit." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly expand the renewable energy with its investment program and demands:" "" "a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpaent trade agreement, do not want to sign either.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both the US and the US do not want to isolate the US from international trade - they simply want to better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should also be paid better, for example Clinton asks.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a wage of starvation.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do on this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must go up, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "on the one hand is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics haunt him so that the budget deficit would be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least from the rich, wants them to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes receipt of his Turkish counterparts in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg palace, I cannot deny that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was a handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile appeared narrowly and barely sparked heat, even for his restrained relations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved as if something bad had never happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable coolness showed that Russia's head of state had not forgotten anything.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was weary.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin denounced and accused Ankara of having fallen into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater, as it was done by a putative friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Building the veto again becomes difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media led to a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The most serious were the accusations made by senior officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has vehemently denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting was held only because Putin was apologizing to President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan mainly needs all the friends he can get after he has been relieved of his ministry last month with a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights, which usually bring millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, travel operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal attack on the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrarian imports are again allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Venagsti phrased it as follows:" "" "tourists there, tomatoes here long" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious at the West as it considers its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "to this end, the sustained resentment on the snail of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara for claiming that he demanded support for the elected government organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, a matter of course, which itself has a deep fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this splendid palace on the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to show how an analyst once described me to "alliance of outsiders": two countries that feel ill-treated and badly treated by the West and now unite.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played a role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks both presidents met at the press conference that they hadn't even touched the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences while Putin opted to emphasise this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey kicked off the Russian military jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State at least talk to each other at least.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian President Pledges Head of Staff Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly released Sergei Ivanov, Chief of Staff.</seg>
<seg id="3">For many years IVANOV has been part of Putin's narrowest confidence.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin, it reads that without giving reasons, Putin has ordered" "" "the dismissal of Ivanov from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been a representative since 2012, has been appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow International Relations Institute (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it is (in Russian) that he later was the clerk and chief of staff of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it's the government's most important task to support your work as head of state in respect of bills of legislation and controls to implement your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov was asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the smiling faces convince?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was one of the closest friends Vladimir Putin for a long time and worked as he did for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the ridicule for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">Is this the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who once was touted as a potential president would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said: "it is true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, this very complicated post - one could almost say - trusting posts for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV participated in the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Before that, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted the most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once assumed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become President of Russia, since a third term of office would have violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another closest associate, Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before becoming president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="10">We are all witnessing an engineering skill of a truly epic degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, nearly 79% of the deck decks are in place and the last section of the deck is getting a gong for the deck in Rosyth, which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.</seg>

<seg id="14">In this fantastic project, the closure represents future-oriented high and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection to the north turret deck, we had to close the existing gap on the north or the shore.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very sensitive activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6.000 tons and had to be pulled up at an incline of about 3%.</seg>

<seg id="2">"" "" "" "the SPD and Greens mean that investors should be put into the duty much more strongly in the future." ""</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "the SPD proposes a" "" "action concept for housing" "" "at the next meeting." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">But the argument is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost, the question is: who should build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">So far, a regulation is missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "said SPD leader Christoph Bratmann:" "" "we agree with the Greens: those who want to build on urban areas must in future show 20 percent of all homes as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the cheap apartments can also be built on stock.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "however, the big issue in the town hall is, however, Bratmann says:" "" "how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "a new urban housing development programme, which will cost millions and still has to be financed, should provide incentives." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "the problem, says Bratmann:" "" "there is currently no agreement between the factions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make as few rules as possible to investors.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left still wants tougher conditions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Despite this, Bratmann says, there is an intensification of the situation in the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the concept of action is implemented, this will take care of additional tasks in the construction management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is not clear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program is not complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you compare the loss of other around 1300 budget apartments, whose funding will expire in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, the political spokeswoman Nicole Palm, should now be bought out of the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought of bringing homes back to the price fixing.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the Weststadt.</seg>
<seg id="26">At one stroke the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the Weststadt, Fristen expires at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 flats you could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the owners, the housing associations do not want this.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social housing in the west city is dramatically increased, the aim of the so-called mess is to be removed.</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of socially disadvantaged in just a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect that there will be movement in the discussion.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenagers and children are no longer going to play outside, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring on screens, has been lamented by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go, it's about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially on the TV, then limited to video games and last on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see technology and outdoor activities not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">It goes without saying that I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters created initially for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop culture phenomena, interest fell slightly before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS and once they have been found they can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the cell phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation who played the game, when she was younger, joined the delusion and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the" "" "average" "" "person restores every day." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, tracking 35.000 users, announced the Washington Post recently that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of subsequent people who train every day 30 minutes jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it merely sees the raw data on the increase in performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to take 30 minutes of "coming from the sofa" and "being active every day" hit deaf ears because many public messages are boring for health and come from people who look miserable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport can not be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Anyone who regularly performs sports reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open, making them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even join the hunt for new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also angry game destroyers, who always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it to do?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even though Smartphone-Apps like Fitbit were already able to track our activity before, they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will diminish with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to poker's success, however, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="5">Dynamic on the jumping horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortless on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Stunningly on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">Brilliant on the whole line.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast kicked the multi-battle track on Thursday and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world under the headlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her overall score of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winners and "Final Five" team mates Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American Women Simone Biles contests on the Swedish bar during the single multi-fight national of women in the art gymnastics event at the Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Bilit is the fourth heterosexual American who gains a multi-fight title and in total the fifth while she solidifies her call to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Bales has dominated the last three years her sport, won 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Retton told her that she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">She expected a final exam in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be considered disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American actresses Simone Biles, on the left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after they have won gold and silver in the single multi-competition women in the gymnastics event at the 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="20">Bila won the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as exclamation mark at the retirement ceremony of Martha Karolyi, who retired in retirement.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted on never having planned the future, it is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their soil exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - is tailored to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl who was adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boormans mother during a school excursion into the gym, trained in the Boorman, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, it has not lost any more competition, a series of victories that will last as long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if Mustafina led easily through two turns, the picture was murky.</seg>
<seg id="27">Floating beams and ground stars - in which Biles holds the world championship title - were lurking.</seg>
<seg id="28">She recovered again with 15,433 on the floating beam - and with a 15.933 on the ground another one.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her gently when she expected her end-bnis - a pure formality - and tears poured on Biles brilliantly red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her book book became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance of Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a Tiebrake.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "this time, the 22-year-old team of men, called" "" "Oma" "", "had a lead." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">After her practice she threw the audience to Kusshausen, overwhelmed by a comeback which sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I imagine under the women's Olympics in Turning and that is more than a reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, I've been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many young girls of other skin colors.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jew is and Madison Kocian, the catholic is round off, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic winner and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world championship in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, how they delivered unexpected, but masterful gymastics routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American who won gold in an individual multi-battle event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but we do not look like gymnastics across the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie struck all the same way as Aly and Madison in order to put it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the Last Five, because the next Olympic Championship will only have four gymnasts in the team. it is also the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics are an expensive sport and gymnasts come primarily in private gymnastics that are maintained by parents who pay for training, training, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for coaches and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gymnastics are in wealthy suburbs that can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs the Turner get their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to explore the communities of countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie to make a more affordable and easy-to-reach turnaround.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my turn-over foundation of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youths (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics that make the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turns develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of "Girl Power" by the Holen of the Olympic team golf and thank you for motivating so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">Former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year due to corruption from office due to corruption</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored just like a destroying government report today.</seg>

<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should carry out an identification card to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">At present, a voter just has to name its name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes to apply indelible ink to a person's finger if they give up their vote to prevent someone choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whistleblower should get more protection, says Sir Eric.</seg>

<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets's election scandal in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special electoral court ruled that the incumbent mayor Lutfur Rahman was to be dismissed after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he would silence his critics with racism and Islamophobic accusations.</seg>

<seg id="18">He was particularly alarmed to the fraudulent letter of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including leading out points to prove the identity</seg>
<seg id="20">In his report, it says: "as proof it was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exerted, especially women and young people in order to choose according to the will of the elderly, especially communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveler Ian Wright schabt his tongue on Europe's dirtiest places for a travel guide</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller undertook his immune system and the dice of a serious test by leaking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shifted his course on a Euro ticket, a handrail at Piccadilly Circus, a slurry button on a train toilet as well as a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before leaving each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he is going to get involved.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to light.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought of leaking the purge button of a pull toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe Mr. Wright talked with doctors and medical professionals about the encouragement of gut bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left what he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his intestine by traveling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public money to train stations to rinsing knobs of toilets, the immune system definitely put under a test</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the film he said:" "" "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and mud water." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was able to do justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His test line showed a luminometry of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison to this, the lumbar number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a russian toilet, which he refused to lick up after their luminometric number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands exhibit one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film" "" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," "" "showing the bacterial count at different places such as the bathroom." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "that comes close to the worst that I have smelled in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm not going to lick here because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Valio Senior Venice President for Snacks, Shafts and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "" "we really wanted to offer consumers something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "we conducted crazy brainstorming that ended that we said" "" "Let's call us Ian." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health will become a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, directing the film, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I told him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick it up and others with which it was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty delicacies on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio from 2015, 84 percent of all respondents in lactic acid bacteria associated with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing the included lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asocial family left their home after delogization with a loss of £50,000 because it had terrorized their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After they were forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls had perforated holes, wooden planks were torn up, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared on the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is thought that she is now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who worked for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer to be repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live this way." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider since this property is believed to be regarded as not so beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted on street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive cries, strikers and curses.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name stood on the lease, got an arrangement for anti-social behavior in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house, which may be torn down under certain circumstances, old rubbish was found</seg>
<seg id="14">In the property in which drugs were traded in the past, the wooden planks were torn up</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbors said they had to fight them on the street and the police had to be called regularly</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing led her and her partner forcibly from the property this week after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>

<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, testified that it would have given the family to cooperate with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="26">Rubbish and old toys were thrown down on the overgrown side of the community house</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he added:" "" "it is a shame that the tenant agrees to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family because delogization is always the last step into consideration of Cornwall Housing." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be horrible.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have given us the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbors and the message conveys that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>

<seg id="33">Workers in property management will now have to evacuate rubbish mountains that surround the house</seg>

<seg id="2">The IOC intends to set up a disciplinary commission.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kenyas athletes face disaster after the second doping affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a coach home.</seg>
<seg id="5">The International Olympic Committee decided to promptly set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">A Kenyan functionary informed that the former Sprinter and present coach, John Anzrah, gave a urine test in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was reported to the team leader Kenias by the doping controllers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The IAAF world association has requested the IOC to gather information about the case in order to exert own investigation, an IAAF spokesman announced.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "depending on the results of the investigation and the measures taken by the IOC the IAAF will make an assessment," "" "it was stated in an IAAF explanation." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">"he (Anzrah) went to the Doping Control station and handed over as Ferguson Roti, handed over the sample and signed it," stated Kenyas Chef de Mission Stephan Arap Soi.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who was on the list for training controls of the world anti-doping agency.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ferguson Rotich was over 800 meters in Beijing in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four days earlier, the Kenyan athletics delegation leader Michael Rotich was withdrawn from the Rio Games.</seg>
<seg id="14">He is said to have informed sportspeople of his country about pending doping tests.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to media reports, he allegedly was arrested at his return to Nairobi's airport.</seg>
<seg id="16">Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC after numerous looping offenses.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the announcement of the more than 2000 doping target controls put forward by the IOC before the Rio Games, an unusual point was noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted.</seg>
<seg id="18">The world anti-doping agency had put much pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.</seg>
<seg id="19">The law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic Games commenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a result, the WADA has taken Kenya from the list of countries whose doping control is compliant with the rules of WADA.</seg>
<seg id="21">Kenya is considered a great runner-nation.</seg>
<seg id="22">The athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a series of TV reports of the ARD, allegations were repeatedly raised that in Kenya doping funds are easily accessible and there should be a considerable mentality of sports fraud.</seg>
<seg id="24">IOC member Richard Pound recently asked for a similar investigation in Kenya, as he had employed in Russian athletics.</seg>
<seg id="25">In doing so, it could be proven that this sport has been systematically and systematically doped in this sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Russia's athletes were subsequently excluded from the summer games.</seg>

<seg id="5">The artistic director, Cecilia Bartoli, wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled the role of Maria a youth room.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the orchestra pit the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "this music is full of rhythm," he enthuses.</seg>
<seg id="7">We always say that it is very Latin American.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>

<seg id="11">In this production Bartoli plays an older Maria.</seg>
<seg id="12">She remembers with melancholy her love with Tony while the younger Maria plays and dances.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Mary always fascinated me.</seg>
<seg id="14">Firstly because it is musically extraordinary!</seg>
<seg id="15">And then Mary's personality would be.</seg>
<seg id="16">She says in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."</seg>

<seg id="18">"" "" "" "it is very similar to me, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman" "", "laughs Bartoli." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."</seg>

<seg id="21">It is a monstrous human being.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "and Bartoli resigns the compliment:" "" "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Conducting is a necessity for him.</seg>
<seg id="24">You see it in every movement, in his eyes, it is his life!</seg>
<seg id="25">It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.</seg>
<seg id="26">We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and a happy approach to life, that is very important at all!</seg>
<seg id="27">For American director Philip Wm. McKinley is up-to-date with the West Side Story: "this piece is about prejudice and fanaticism."</seg>
<seg id="28">Today we have the refugees, at that time the Puertories have gone to New York, and the New York residents did not want them.</seg>
<seg id="29">They are the same topics, and they are as meaningful today as at that time.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals don't get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">2021 will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">But it's not stupid as before: summer holidays, heat and country elections - that bites.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are supposed to be convinced by the election champions, are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the holidaymakers travelling in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not natives, so you may not choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: during the holidays helpers who hang up posters, inflate balloons, flatten out flyers and enumerate votes at the end are just tedious to apply.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign shortly before the people over.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if one can say it at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind CDU in surveys.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strongly newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition dusty.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years of age and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one sees from his large posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the country, distributing roses and chatting a little with the people, just as his legendary eloquent predecessor Harald Ringstorff also did.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, Markering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the debt on the rise of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "their refugee policy, their" "" "We create this" "" "hastened the rise of the right-wing populists, which is now likely to cost him the beautiful ministry." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU, with its leading candidate, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to make election campaigns at the right place at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale demonstrations twice; Merkel's federal election district is located in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "there was probably the majority from other federal states," "" "said Vincent Kokert, secretary general of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in NDR." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's too bad not to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany, once Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Apart from that, the Northeast CDU largely dispenses with the usual campaign conditions at market places and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "this, says Kokert, plays only a" "" "subordinate role" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "the Union has also noticed that you are crumbling the base in the country that it has to make a lot of effort to find a wire to the people again." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">It goes like the left, the SPD, the Greens: there is hardly any present in the vast expanses of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">The advice of the CDU election campaigner Coco to his co-workers is also self-exposing: "they have to go where it is, where people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much is at stake, Sellering has now appealed its SPD to a particularly committed election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls, the S & D Group lagged behind partner CDU (25) and just ahead of the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the election of 2011, the SPD gained a clear victory of 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, a small party with seven percent in polls, should make the leap into the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of holiday-need and lay their election campaign largely on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "online election campaign" "" "is the name of the president of the country Claudia Müller." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, green campaigners go to search for local vocal chords under the vacationers.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gajek, the top candidate, curvates straight with a houseboat through the mecklenburgian lakes and also finds it beautiful.</seg>

<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for the construction works, which begin at 5.30 in the morning and end only at 8pm, praise is everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "they made everything pretty jagged," "" "says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station." ""</seg>

<seg id="6">There is no delay.</seg>

<seg id="8">Also praised is the receipt of those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to setting up accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site moved to the south on Monday and also the locking of the Aspergstrasse in Ofterdingen was lifted and therefore the connection to Rottenburg has resumed, the traffic situation within the town has relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Citizens can now sail on both sides from Ofandingen from the B 27.</seg>
<seg id="11">The road through the village seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "there have been considerable complaints there," "" "says the Deputy Chief Executive Officer Florian King, responsible for the rehabilitation management of the refurbishment." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of the street, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many creeping trails were searching and more familiar with their navigation than the signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks partied in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the speed limits were not met, the municipality also called for an increase in the Mössingen vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="16">"there have been considerable oversteps," says King, who made himself aware of the situation.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have been made.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest speed was 77 hourly kilometers in the speed 30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the construction site has been moved, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businessmen on the B 27 it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Businessmen don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 rehabilitation has led to revenue outbreaks allows everyone to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "who has less to do with the" "" "end customer" "", "i.e. produced for other companies, for which the renovation has hardly any consequences." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "also at the dealership Maier Thomas Sulz talks about a" "" "maximum slight decline" "", "but also admits that of course" "" "the running-class is missing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The most heavily exploited are the local streets.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly a crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "not only him, but all restaurants have hit it" "" "hard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">The customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.</seg>
<seg id="31">We have to be happy about every Euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "he estimates the sales losses to" "" "more than 50 percent" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "the road renovation took its operation" "" "back for two years." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">He has to release half of his associates.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been dismissed, politics would have reacted otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead Regierungspräsident Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from Göhner if there could be a financial compensation, with the hint that the restaurant would benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties, where something was handled more generously.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all complaints Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been here since 1715 and refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">He can understand that other regular guests are now less frequently visited because of complicated traffic.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't go there, it is also somewhere else nice.</seg>
<seg id="42">The fact that his pedigree returns to the end of the refurbishment work, Göhner has no doubts about it.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and avian flu, Göhner keeps the effects of the B 27 construction work on his clientele for the biggest crisis that his restaurant experienced in its long history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work, this is brutal already.</seg>

<seg id="9">Sales in Western Europe alone, the second most important market in China, sales were 14 percent below the year-earlier figure.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely middle-aged men love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you rush to the comments section to sow it under the pseudonym NonAlleEnvelid Men's Intermediate with arduous insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the many-addressed resurrection of records is not attributable to a boom in millennials, who want to welcome the news of physical objects but to Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight after the age of 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's also not a horde by amateur collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older vendors still retain their feelings (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog is a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit and tumble wild before I stay, hold my hands and say something better: "so let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera off for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I of Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (Number of data: eight men middle aged, one woman, probably around 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through business to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I already value," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I did not follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason he has such a vast number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford than they appeared and to buy items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 1960s, early 70's, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I guess was too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and add: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers whom he meets are meeting on the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pub, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations that I have led, people usually have been getting rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of followers of the plate chants of a given age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a store like Fonica to see that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers hit the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some of the record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to stand back to the stability of confidential vinyl covers, from objects that awaken happy memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," says WEZ.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as a collector so I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's a simple way to get involved spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "a colleague explodes from a record pile." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month had not yet heard them.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player, which they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not own a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried as I pass through a stack of bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data number: three middle-aged men) has noticed a "trophies aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came here just recently and said:" I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a radiohead sound plate so that I can put them on the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musicastic.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say," "" "I don't have a record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, who come in slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the soundboards, has a colorful audience when I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around 70, tourists who take photos, teenagers and middle aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts's newest synthesizer and sexton pop instead of experimental jazz rogues from the loudspeakers - is it good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks strangely lonely, but the psychological trauma is hard to detectable by standing beside someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the store for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more of a shopping mall stroll than buying a big one.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve much, so collecting sheets is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is... "she drives off with a dearted sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I am pretending to mute the jeans hottie, I watch a group of young teenage girls who are grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a crossover record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a stairway, a wall full of records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soho, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, is the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research showed that the results of YouGov agree, they are unconsidered, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard in school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday mornings with security not by strolling through the record shops of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates as they avoid the starving gaze of an uncanny, 30 year old false moderator who is raging beyond the shoulders of a middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court has rejected an offer from the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a trial hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary transactions where individuals within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to gas drinks, sell hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy, from which no taxes would be paid and which contain a fire and sanity risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups shared the court that businesses and restaurants are important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not provide sufficient food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also led to the fact that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 temporary shops, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais "were absolutely comprehensible."</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "Judge Jean-François Molla said that the grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely feeding people who" "" "live in extremely precarious conditions" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by the breaking down was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is operated profitably and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids' café.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "in a letter to the Guardian it was said that the closure would be" "" "for these children of a catastrophe, of which the youngest eight years are old." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimates on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle of the jungle increased to more than 9,000 people - the highest number up to now - after a steep increase in newcomers over the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's racers have to adapt to the next generation of speed meters: in different federal states, among others in Hessen and Brandenburg, new flashes are tested, which should be particularly effective.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic Enforcement trailer of Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, in the areas of accident, where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, on motorway construction sites or to rehabilitated bridges with temporary speed limit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a stationary set-up for compliance with speed limits.</seg>
<seg id="5">A permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Enforcement trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days in continuous measurement, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can also be detected at the same time across multiple tracks.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits as well as travel restrictions on time, ticket and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>
<seg id="9">The trailer can be moved in a state-of-the-art condition according to the manufacturer with each car with trailer hitch.</seg>

<seg id="12">Since 2015, the trailer is tested according to Vitronic in various federal states and is now also used.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at 7-er rugby came to an abrupt halt in the final hurdle in the form of the Fijis on Thursday night when they were defeated in Rio de Janeiro with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji provided a master class in handling, side-stitching, back backs, line and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was defeated by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back to them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of this, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in top form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least a Briton will have a gold medal tomorrow around his neck: Fijis's head coach Ben Ryan, former chief of England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind it.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, she lost any game under Ryan at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they only lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This hatch will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderful and let off the attacks of GBs from fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if they were running in running buses. the World Series Winners went 5-0 upwards when Osea Kolinisau was crawling in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With just four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right-hand corner he turned around.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A hedge tackling of Mitchell stopped the mountain from Sierra Leone Nakarawa to score a third gate, but it only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh-minute athlete jasa Veremalua in the right corner a touch down and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the reunion and there was still more than one minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou pressed another weak tacklings of the GB team and stormed down to the line to make a fool.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB still cores.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB led basic changes to the half-time and closed the fijian gap... for a whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua toured after a brilliant interim play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Sea sulphian, whose fans sang, flags wave and danced on the grandstand.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach to Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame topped the cake with another attempt in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle was ringing, the Fijis embraced and GB kicked down crushingly into the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa in a tight half-finals match from the race - Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling of Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony of the 15-side team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="4">The echo of the coach Robin Williams was there when she ruined the second Olympic gold in the second without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sport, who set such a standard.</seg>

<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the break to a minimum, if this is the right concept in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to get better soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.</seg>

<seg id="24">Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so a massive thank you to him. he is the best trainer in the world.</seg>

<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to stop, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "stay in the process, stay in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not out to make something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">We didn't want fireworks today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race what we did.</seg>

<seg id="7">"" "the work of the Veitenstein group was" "" "Bavarian far than exemplary." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="8">Behind all this Rupert Göller, who worked for 31 years in the Zweckverband employee, was 28 years as Managing Director.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was now retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The potable potable water association of the Veitenstein group, located in Kottdorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, transports approximately 150,000 cubic meters of water per year and supplies 32 places and hamlet with approximately 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">Member communities are the municipalities Kirchhoff, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are water supply contracts for other towns and villages.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairwoman, Breitbrunn mayor Gertrude Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was appointed as a water goalkeeper in 1985 and was appointed CEO of the Zweckverband in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water pipeline construction and maintenance work to office and organizational activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency kits on weekends," said the chairman.</seg>
<seg id="15">As an outstanding event, it called the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchase in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation of farmers, the refurbishment of the elevated tank (1999), the repurchase of a central computer control system (2004) and the remodelling of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There has never been a standstill and there have been innovations again and again because water is the most important food for water and drinking water.</seg>
<seg id="17">In its laudation, she praised Goeth's faithful, reliable and correct service for more than 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He used a lot of heart blood for his water-purpose bandage and he literally lived the water-purpose bandage as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the concept of success of the Veitenstein group for nitrate reduction in front of the Lower Franconia water forum.</seg>
<seg id="20">For this he received a lot of praise and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller, for his part, praised Mr. Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best water goalkeeper and he was a faithful little boy.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">As high points from his point of view, he described the well construction and the restructuring of the purpose association.</seg>
<seg id="25">But the biggest challenge and the most difficult application were the tubing in the high canister at Kirchhoff on a 3rd January.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night, so that the villages could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">Also the supply of Neubrunn could only be maintained, because one filled the high reservoir of Pettstadt with hoses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The management of the drinking water management association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.</seg>

<seg id="2">The crisis-packed and energy-intensive German steel industry remains unaffected by additional costs in millions of millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that the sector threatened from the cost of green electricity are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "the German Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" "" "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" "" "(WAZ, Friday edition) remains at the release of the renewable energy environment for the so-called self-current production in the German steel industry." ""</seg>

<seg id="6">The European Commission was therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gas from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened to cover an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission following talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators are replaced in the steel plants, an EEG levy of 20 percent will fall.</seg>
<seg id="10">But this too will not be raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on self-sufficiency.</seg>

<seg id="19">European manufacturers throw price dumping in Chinese steel companies.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation has been somewhat relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, imposed import duties on import steel show impact, on the other hand the economic prospects in China have brightened up.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is not clear how sustainable the price collection is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, the prices would have stagnated.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">Last but not least, ThyssenKrupp also did not want to exclude the closing of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">Around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, mind, health: singing does seniors well</seg>
<seg id="2">The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp into her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, she occupied the subject of music in the Lehramt-studies, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotional and physical," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall living, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good for her health and mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because singing is a great hobby for seniors, Erhard Hackler says of the German senior league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, Hackler describes.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular gatherings, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "to talk and organize, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be stressful in the positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For this reason, seniors train a deep and controlled respiration.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand their lungs are not as fast as they can in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">On the elderly, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Employment Agency of the Seniors-Organisations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations the common singing had a much higher value, it belonged to everyday life, both at school and in leisure time, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people arouses many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies, dementia patients fall back to long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, the head also requires special performance, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">To focus simultaneously on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially older people who live alone practice so not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem is also growing by singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I practise for a long time, I will get better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz suggests.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who is listening when there is a sound next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">Looking for the right offer, Seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a retirement home, one simply can join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views over the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Anyone wishing to sing in an ecclesiastical choir can turn directly to the church or church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">You can also find many old choirs through the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those who have no access to the Internet can ask family, friends or neighbours for help with internet searches.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who want to sing should definitely join a choir, Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does good to the soul and has something liberating - it applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="11">A taxi driver was injured in detonation near the popular beach of Patong which was popular with tourists.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani, on the south-eastern coast of the country, another bomb exploded which killed an urban employee.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the leprosy had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the territory of the coastal police.</seg>
<seg id="14">After all, some detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast as well as in Chumphon on the south-east coast called for several wounded.</seg>

<seg id="17">"" "" "" "we expect it to be a co-ordinated attack." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">It was too early to speak for possible motives, but most likely it was about the actions of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not related to the Islamist uprising movement or international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is only local sabotage which is limited to limited areas and provinces," "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">In recent days, the authorities have received secret evidence of impending attacks in the south of the country - though they had not been informed of the exact time and locations.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police instructed their officials across the country to enhance security around important government buildings, airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand there are repeatedely smaller bombings, but they are mostly not directed against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hua Hin is a palace built over the years by Thailands King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">After the mine explosion explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends the instructions of the Thai security authorities to follow.</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="30">After confrontations between security forces and Muslim populations, there will be no need for necessary trips to these provinces.</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday were held a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military great influence over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta boss and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs had been an attempt to foment chaos, while the country is heading towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military unrest that had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody civil strife will benefit itself to restore the kingdom to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, it has not been possible for the military to get a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Almost a year ago, in Bangkok, 20 people were killed at an attack on a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the bloodiest attack on the recent history of the country.</seg>

<seg id="3">This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>

<seg id="6">In social networks, Habte was subsequently transformed into the viral internethite.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, the 24-year-old finished his lead with a delay of 48 seconds and finished the 59th place of 59 starters.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not exactly sporty figure, which attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24-year-old still participates in the Olympic Games?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special starting right from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to promote swimming in underrepresented countries.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the facility in Azendorf the waste water fee will be increased at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a preliminary calculation, the waste water in Azzury will be at 4.37 euros per cubic metre.</seg>
<seg id="4">As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, in the approval of the budget by the district office Kulmbach found that undercover for these sewage systems was established.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal bases, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the systems at a cost-effective basis.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of October 1, 2016, citizens and industrial and industrial companies from Welshahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopar, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to dig deeper into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">Fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Board Director Herbert Schmidt showed the panel, a new calculation of the charges for sewage treatment of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, it is also possible to compensate for over- or undercover from the foregoing calculation period.</seg>
<seg id="10">The severe rebate increases Schmidt explained that there are relatively small facilities in all three sewage systems with very low waste water, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">As a result of the low distribution base, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.</seg>
<seg id="12">Sewage charges in all three facilities are also slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, in the recumbent calculation period, all three plants were not least incurred due to their age of refurbishment and repair expenses.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plant in Azzury is nearly 30 years old, the plants for Welshahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopik are almost 20 years old.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt indicated that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to a damage in the sewage plant in Azzury.</seg>
<seg id="16">The nearly 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overhauled in the pump plant Welthigh and after nearly 20 years of operation the first sewage pipe had to be removed, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation system had to be installed in order to comply with the water-legal requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "Schmidt:" "" "to these extraordinary expenses came the continued maintenance and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account in the new calculation period." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which were still considerably below the current level during the previous calculations in 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "stone houses made it clear that the expenses for the operation and maintenance are" "" "fully penetrated" "" "in the three plants with low waste water." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" effect as Asian caricature criticized</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filtering tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million everyday users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders on the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from Roy Lichtenstein's painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are non-flowery, self-rotating tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All miscarriages reach the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the past Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in which they were accused of promoting Blackface or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">Several critics called a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow face," as soon as this week suggested a filter to some users who gave them slit eyes, false teeth and wrecked cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has with diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and indignation were spread widely on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat told that it would have deactivated the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was designed as a tribute to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism recalled the filter of infringing clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others refused the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">Grace Sparapani wrote in an e-mail, a Korean-American student, whose tweet has been widely spread over the photos that the filter was "hurtful and bad said uncomfortable."</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "she added that" "" "it is difficult to argue with the contrast of a very reluctant Asian caricature and filter effects." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellowable, but that the yellow face has been dragged to the extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses that cultural stumbling block.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats's big audience of young people - who are more different than their older counterpart in terms of race - might expect to expect more sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "when one of Snapchats filters creates an image that is insulting to a user," "" "it is much more difficult for such things to remain unnoticed than it was before," "" "said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">She said that race-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the recruitment practices of Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the large part of white, only male leadership and ended up with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat mostly left unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and refers to its status as a private enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a personnel responsible for concentrating on underrepresented population groups and on internal integration efforts.</seg>

<seg id="2">Military members of the United States Central Command adjusted intelligence intelligence to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed it to report in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the Republican Committee of the Army Committees, Secret Service Committees and the Comforcement Commitment, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command Secret Service analysts who reported how superiors changed their appreciation to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence intelligence, typically detrimental by high-level Centcom commanders, regularly showed a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions on the spot would have allowed and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article cited the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at the CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," stated Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id="7">The management errors in the CentCom extend to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts saw themselves exposed to pressure from their superiors to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, comments and statements prior to Congress were far more positive than the facts," "" "the report states." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom applicant publicly announced that a military reconquest Mossuls could begin already in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigation, it's so clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, a Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the Central Command Council changed the intelligence reports to minimize the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The republicans called Task Force in life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed with more detailed insights while the investigations will continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of the CentCom are underway through the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the intelligence committee published their own findings on Thursday which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, CentCom has created an overly restricted trial for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," gave the highest ranking Demokrat in the Committee, Member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process, Mr. Ship," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "shook the morality of analysts and" "" "there was too little room for dissenting opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Ship and the democrats stated that they had no clues on the intervention of the White House at the CentCom analysts as to a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by" "" "The Daily Beast." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported investigation by the Pentagon's Inspector who was accepted after CentCom's complaints.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the Congress, while investigations of the General Inspector were still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also stated that" "" "experts sometimes have divergent opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under US leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, last year's accusations raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of more than ten years ago, when a CentCom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document on how the then government under George W. Bush regarded only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the present reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the past year, according to government officials, the team led by Mr. Hooker states that contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these temporary refineries were put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This recognition, however, was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">CentCom's Supreme Commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the Legislative for his excessively positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel in Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after having fired three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam made the first two goals for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games were supposed to be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she could not remember what ever did.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "I have no idea." "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">I am not one of the people who keep their doors in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, she knows: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Britons in the first place, who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final round of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two teams will gain first and second place within their group of six teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first place will take the strong Dutch somewhat longer out of the way that the other group leads.</seg>
<seg id="10">Whatever the game might start on Saturday, the Americans caused a surprising vortex through their success story four years after they landed on the last of 12 seats at the last London Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had a hockey bat in hands for the first time with three years (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel university), at 16 years she became a national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the Kader.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came 2012 when everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the national team and thus began to turn things to a better one.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," "" "said Bam." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">We didn't have the workload in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have been able to rend the rudder completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening, Bam opened the door-room in the first half of the game with a back-stroke from the close-up area.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone into the game without any victory, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1-0 to the third quarter, until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">It took a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and knocked the ball into the gate to get the Americans a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the Torkeeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," Parnham said, but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the heart of the Olympic Games Rage, the trampolines' Zen</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and inescapable, a fast relay race between competition and quest.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is handed out to the triathlete from the crossbow shooter to float.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation during the queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time with the Olympic Games and a swarm of women with dimples, could have been among these well-known names sent to prime time, built up by sponsors and well-being TV advertising if he were a swimmers, a gymnast or even a fencer.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold at the Olympic trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame doesn't illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports, which are not generally accepted: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast-swimming and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I would like to make more modest arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw your attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years has been so scandalously perceived that many who had asked me did not know it was ever an Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to compete, there has never been a medal in the trampolines and until 2012 had an athlete who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians are inclined to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian women for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their Gold Medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain outsider, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened Ear for a clown school than the one for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an experienced enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonistic trembling of its never-ending bounce - but also the gradient of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially united.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "Trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging victors jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have to land a number of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "you will be judged according to the official Olympic program according to the execution, difficulty and" "" "flight time" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Twenty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists have to move up and down in their quest for gold, sometimes to the finish, sometimes to the finish, sometimes towards the top and downwards in the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They not only chase the finish line or the exit wall, but in the televised transmission also another highlight: the world or the Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="28">The purposeful striving is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to stir even a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel as a little tiring when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing pause.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up again.</seg>
<seg id="34">Here too there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant suspension of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as zen as the competition can only be at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; most of the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by acquiring and objecting male athletes - as the male American gymnasts recently suggested according to the Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley anticipates his new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="4">Witnesses testified that dozens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police in shooting exchanges.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopian right to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But during the last months protests against the government shaken the country and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people rushed onto the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's response to human rights organizations was merciless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that police brutally shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos that are circulating about the protests, probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security people strike young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "the head of the UN Human Rights Agency is now calling for a thorough investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, Project Manager of the Horn of Africa from the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated from the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorist attacks beyond the region, especially in Somalia. few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is a new commuter train in Addis Ababa capital.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia was anything but a role model for democracy, human rights organisations have continually led to oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been limited, and dissidents were silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or prison, killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you oppress people and have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," "" "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">All the youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold in relation to the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following a widely critical election last year, the ruling party and its allies gained the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions along the border with Eritrea rise; a struggle for this jagged, disputed line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts worry that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden have been forced to exploit the turbulence and re-arm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness tend to explode under the surface after years of drinkage.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was only in recent years that many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media, as cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more frequent and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still can communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians stated that they gathered so much protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia's mainly Christian high lands, prospered in politics and the economy as they exploited the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But that is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are there to coordinate under a screen," "" "said Mulatu Gemeu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray population, accounting for about 6 per cent of the population, dominating the military, intelligence, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopian Prime Minister until his death at an illness that was not made public in 2012 for 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think of corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this fundamental skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian's new Prime Minister, Hailamariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively intransparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia had experienced such a turmoil in 2005 after thousands of elections protested, which, according to analysts, were apparently pledged by the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following raids many protesters were killed, even though they were less than in the last months and this period of unrest was passing relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as their measurable progress in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal missal of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters in Gondar, an amanian town, conducted shops of Tigray and hatred of Tigray is becoming more and more common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests lead the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for dome-flights over neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While Westerners clearly want to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim to Obama that ISIS was founded "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday, fearing that his multiple repeated claims, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, were the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not serious.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raises new questions about the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he is able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also entails its fellow combatants who endeavour to protect him during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position of having to explain statements which he could not have meant at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">After having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump left behind the allegation on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to point out that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in a morning tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was the opposite to the previous day, where Mr. Trump told in a series of interviews, he said the accusation was completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to help weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism encapsulates Mr. Trump while trying to steer the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling survey values.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked to the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this topic again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would result in higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he had a strong criticism when he thought that the Russians were to hack away Mrs. Clinton's e-mails, but later he said, "Of course, I said it sarcastically."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back down as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive, and then, if necessary," "" "clarify" "" "according to what the reaction is." "" "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "instead of defusing the vote for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has assumed an even more corrosive tone because his survey values have gone further." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a leading lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally trying not to apologize for his provocative statements, he frequently accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humor.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is intensifying the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps has brought his loyal co-workers into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent advocates of Trumps, tried to defend the candidate in a CNN interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political commentaries" "" "said Mr. Giuliani about the correctness of Mr Trumps about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had established the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organisation, he called it ambush, completely false, and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream republicans attempt to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton had served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, allowed ISIS to spread to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of spying around on each of his words and being prejudiced against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he despised the poor, miserable" "" "poor" "" "TV experts trying to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats mocked Mr. Trump's apology as a further proof that he was unsuitable for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="3">Of course, the prices from his Bedford Avenue store were displaced.</seg>
<seg id="4">Soap Cherie's business, which replaced the verb in the summer of 2014, sells handmade soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Native people mourned for the last loss in a gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know, New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel excluded and Verb is now a soap business."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is changing, it is also reinvention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revitalised Club Cafe opened in Greenpoint last November, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">Coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old coffee shop, who is the owner and managing director of the new cafe.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered him to provide funds for a new office, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>

<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment too.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">There are sandwiches with bacon and cheese on the menu and there are garnishes such as capers and sauced onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural rice dishes.</seg>

<seg id="22">After nine months Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "many old customers were also displaced from Williamsburg prices," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira has been such a client.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg in former times and regularly visited the verb.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after having moved to Greenpoint, she would take the road.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland shark: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland shark usually only come to the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland shark only get offspring with 150 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Greenland shark floats leisurely at the bottom of the North Atlantic, reaching an average of just 1,220 metres in an hour.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it arrives, the five meter long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">This slowness of lifestyle, however, seems to be a recipe for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at least from a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "insanity," "" "comments Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span that means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the biologist suspected long ago that Greenland shark would become rock-old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland sharks are hard to observe, finally they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know correspondingly little about the lifestyle of Greenland shark.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow motion measured them when they fitted out six animals with a transmitter just in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Prey make this sharks nevertheless: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed up the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Maybe they hunt sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice cream and look for cadavers, that are tortured from higher layers of water.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues were now exploring 28 Greenland sharks, which fishers between 2010 and 2013 brought to Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the biggest size was 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals they analyzed with the carbon-14 method the lens nucleus of the sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein are not replaced later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Its birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, as a nuclear weapon search drew large quantities of this radioactive material into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In comparison with 220 centimetres of the third-smallest animal, the lens nucleus, on the other hand, contained a small amount of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons trying to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the other hand, all major Greenland shark in their lens nucleus had normal carbon-14 amounts resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493-centimeter-long Greenland shark, while the record shark is likely to be 392 years old with 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland shark females only get offspring, if they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign the length to an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood at the threshold to become sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland shark with the multiplication obviously suffer at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is not by chance that such Methuseles live mainly in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a colt of 211 years old, in whose bacon on the neck was a 120 year old harpoon tip was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on a flame of asparagus.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on as many offspring as possible," "" "explains the Evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal, on the other hand, should rather invest its resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="1">Jewish director disintegrates Berlin hotel because Israeli preselection was removed after "Arab" call - RT News</seg>
<seg id="2">A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media record after he had betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had not listed an Israeli pre-election because Arab guests had "requested" according to an employee. "</seg>
<seg id="3">Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah," left his annoyance at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.</seg>
<seg id="4">During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel at the hotel's list of countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">The country, however, was not listed between the countries that can be invoked directly from the hotel room.</seg>
<seg id="6">How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?</seg>
<seg id="7">Wrote Lanzmann.</seg>
<seg id="8">Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center.</seg>
<seg id="9">After an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "the answer he received there," "" "sent it forth," "" "as Lanzmann wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "the hotel staff said the measure was a" "" "deliberate decision of management of the Kempinski Hotel" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The reason behind that was even more fury in the director.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre-election be erased," "" "the Lanzmann employee was quoted." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "the Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a" "" "big shame," "" "reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">We were appalled and dismayed by this event.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is really very shameful.</seg>
<seg id="17">The fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater disgrace.</seg>
<seg id="18">This does not require any explanation.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "we expect the hotel to draw" "" "the right conclusions," "" "said the minister." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The incident triggered a rather big resonance on the internet, where people called the whole thing a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "some of them subordinated the Kempinski Hotel to" "" "indulge in" "" "the alleged prompts of Arab guests." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "be ashamed," "" "it was said in another article stating that the hotel, which is situated on the noble Kurfürstendamm, stands near a synagogue." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Trade between Russia & Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business</seg>
<seg id="2">With the lifting of sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the exchange rate between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="3">Since international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, the interest shown in Russian companies in shops in the country has been growing strongly, shared by the ambassador.</seg>
<seg id="4">Russian companies take up existing ties with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "of course, the further commercial expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," "" "said Dzhagaryan." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">He noted that in the first five months of 2016, the trade-turnover between Russia and Iran grew by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and was $856 million.</seg>
<seg id="7">In particular, Russian imports increased by 91.5 percent in Iran and totalled $697 million.</seg>
<seg id="8">Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $158 million.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "the trade break was achieved through deliveries of machinery, agricultural vehicles and weapons," "" "said the ambassador." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Dzhagaryan is a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last year, Russian foreign representatives accounted for some 35,000 Visas, primarily travelling visas, to Iranian citizens.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, Iran reached the top 20 countries concerning the number of tourists in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "it could be said that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia are broken from last year," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">At the same time, only relatively few Russians visit Iran, something from which the ambassador hopes that it will change.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I personally can recommend visiting the towns of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, who have preserved the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good condition," he said.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Altar Boys from the pastoral care unit Ebay-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Four stages were tackled together.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time to the next Romsleigh ride of all the Ministries in two years, the St. Anna district of ministries has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrim migration.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations have been tested and one finally decided for the Episcopal city of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis from Bittelbronn, and Gruol, and Haigerloch, and Heiligenstadt, set themselves in the way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before, Father Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the Pilgrimage and informed the Pilgrims.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb there was driven by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a Münster Our Lady stands and so the pilgrim route was started from Münster.</seg>
<seg id="9">Each day and evening the individual daytrips were framed by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and writing texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the Minis visited field crosses, chapels or churches always to sing together a song from a specially made pilgrim song.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the nights, parishes of the local parishes were available.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the stage destinations Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller cared for a tasty and strengthening dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">We continued on the second day via Furtwangen in Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">The next day, the stage after St. Peter, which was the most strenuous route, had to be lowered about 500 metres in altitude and then climbed up again.</seg>
<seg id="15">The earned reward was a joint barbecue at the bathing pond in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter it went to the final stage to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Minis was visibly relieved and happy in the afternoon at the Freiburg cathedral and walked through the gate of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a small impulse God was thanked here.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the evening mass in Münster, the Minis welcomed on the pilgrimage site were greeted by Kooperator Markus Obert.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day was still time for the city of Breisgau.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon we went back to Horb by train.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the end all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner last night in the men's team sprint in Velorom in Rio for glory when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow embarked on the anchorage that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made himself an affair. the JPG made the legend proud when he rushed home to visit New Zealand's favorites.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago while Hoy took the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place at the London railway world championships in March despite the appearance of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as Hindes appeared.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement generated a gap which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy won - and Skinner prevailed in the qualification rounds an Olympic champion, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">After his lap, Hindes was almost back, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation in which Hindes went in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenny and, above all, Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they got on the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it's a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I am only here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an olympic record in the final round and defeated the world champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 at the side of Kennys and Hoys, Hindes admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the road.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection from England's rival.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Hindes said," "" "It feels like the whole GB of flags on the grandstand like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We went so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress in the past five months, we expect successful five days in the bicycle rom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form Kennys it's in the realm of possible that he has repeated Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a contest.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for the British sport; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same by Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint that starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "" "I just enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a little lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "Hindes said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won Gold in 2012 in London, was 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had argued with representatives before the qualification yesterday, when officials called him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued tomorrow and ended, Laura Despite, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in the world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on its strong railway team to dominate the mid period of the Olympic Games and to bring a flock of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly exceptional representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio have been shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">Dramas played in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sex and mobbing allegations as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the cycle of velodrome, it looks quite as if the now legendary reputation of GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the Aluminum sleeve of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workstations of workers - are at stake, as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract, thereby raising all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company announced.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the decision of the Government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, not to grant any further subsidies for the operation of the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy established for 20 years is scheduled to expire in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs -direct and indirect - could be endangered in closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effects since the melting process uses around 10 percent of the total power generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014, Alcoa terminated the Point Henry melting plant, which last year led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant.</seg>
<seg id="9">Alcoa's melting plant in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation as to the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The facility is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp are holding smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means another physical demand for electricity by melting," "" "said the company." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "AGL continued to say that the contracts were so-called" "" "hedging transactions" "", "which should have come into force from November 2016." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12 month notice period, so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "from this point, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in the financial year 17," "" "said the electricity supplier." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on income on AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL stated that it had already depreciated the value of the Treaties in the amount of $187 million in "anticipation of a termination."</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "Alcoa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts, the" "" "ability of Alcoas... to operate the enamel or to ensure power to melt" "" "does not interfere." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said that in 2010 it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, who should have entered into force from November this year, even if it is still an explanation why it has resigned from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of Portland melting plant in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to analysts' statements at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland will consume around 600 megawatts of power per year and about 900 megawatts of electricity per year.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the Managerin and mother of the Kardashian Jenner clan, Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran to Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on their Instagram account.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "in a room full of people I love, the sight of this powder brought me to tears," "" "Kendall wrote." ""</seg>

<seg id="6">This represents the most cliché act of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls participate somehow in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of kardashians has begun.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's big sister Kim might have beaten her in terms of the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the magazine's September issue is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most commonly sold issue of the year for vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that is more like an illustrated book than a fashion magazine, the edition draws a large number of advertisers (Laut fashionista were from the 832 pages of the tome 615 pages of advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover star is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still leak before official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>

<seg id="14">Oscar-winner and Dior-brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the little chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls below the former category, she is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or youngsters of today who know how to shoot a good Snapchat video (even if everything applies to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course Jenners likes success not everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With her reality TV story, Jenny's position in the world of fashion was always something tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret-model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her "the mistletoe of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings cooked up again when the message came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But to walk around on the displeasure seems to pass by at the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">It runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your priming of Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">They and all their sisters are selling pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sells her paintings by Cindy Crawfords daughter to the WTV magazine.</seg>
<seg id="30">And in her free time she is seen in Reality TV. presumably only to see her sister Kourtney and her children.</seg>

<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, so it was not good in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was rather clumsy.</seg>

<seg id="14">Even accessing web pages was possible via HTML-browser, albeit slow.</seg>
<seg id="15">A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.</seg>

<seg id="2">For companies that make money online using online advertising, attempts to bypass ad blocking are the same as a "cat and mouse game."</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blockings on its desktop side, Adblock Plus released a blog post in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to re-block advertising on the social network.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop side would change the encoding for its ads in order to make it difficult to recognise the recognition of which part of the advertisement is advertising.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to circumvent the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a blog post, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this type of Hin-and-Her-Fight between the line-up open source community and the hangers has been underway since the invention of ad blowers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once inhabitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus with tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere could once have repudiated similar conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, strawberry-like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably has more dry areas than de Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to house life and protected from rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus is exposed to its daily side of the sun for almost two months," "" "explained scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the sun's heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures which are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously assumed by planet researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was once habitable, Venus -- over the course of several billion years - was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was blown away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their hydrogen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus as we know it today.</seg>

<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers understand why stars rotate in star-houses to different rates as well as in which context the rotation-time periods with planetary emergence are standing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other star enhancers, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The star cluster of the Pleiades is 445 light years distant from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this cluster of stars, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, are reaching adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now turning fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak rotation rates, these mature stars repel large quantities of starches.</seg>

<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping events.</seg>
<seg id="4">A wiped athlete would have won almost one medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh competition day, the first official doping events have become the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">Chinese floats Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter-obstacle-runner Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested and expelled in Brazil - immediately before the start of the already critically acclaimed athletics competitions this news came to an end.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was demonstrated last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">The International Women's Court (CAS) confirmed their expulsion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old finished fourth in the finals over 100 m Butterfly, only 0.09 seconds missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen should have participated in the performances of more than 50 m Freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">The International Olympic Committee (IOC) applied for the opening of the B-Trial and a hearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "the national association takes the matter" "" "very seriously and requires full cooperation in the investigations," "" "said Xinhua from a message:" "" "we will work together with the International Criminal Court (CAS) and will accept the judgement." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The first time in history is no longer the IOC, but the CAS is responsible for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also in the night of Rio the news seeping through the positive rehearsal at Danekova, the 33-year-old went on the offensive.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," this was "an incredible shock," she said to Bulgarian TV station BNT.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "it is innocent," "" "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," "" "said the Athletics." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, the blood doping agent EPO should act in the forbidden substance.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekova was suspended for the time being, according to BNT, the B test should already have been positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov immediately reported to the Athenians word.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "I don't understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions," "" "he said," "" "We Bulgarian are under observation, so many have already been excluded." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, all weight lifters from the chronically doping-loaded nation must not participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday the case was also known as "Adrian Zielinski," the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positive for three days as his brother Tomasz on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both deny the intake, but both must not start in the class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before the athletes start, the Danekova case is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The World Association IAAF has banned the entire Russian team up to an exception because of systematic doping, even the Kenyan generation produces a lot of bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the previous agreements in China caused serious disputes also between athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">So the Frenchman Camille Lacourt resorted to the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harsch.</seg>
<seg id="28">"sun Yang pinkley lila."</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "when I see the podium more than 200 m of Freestyle, I want to commit myself," "" "said Lacourt on the French radio." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun was also at the heart of a debate with the Australian Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I have no time and no respect for doping fraud," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Sun had been tested positive for the stimulant trimetazide in the Chinese championships in 2014, but only had to retire for a three month period.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data Comic: so perfide, hackers blackmail their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Developers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies - and they are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey by the malware protection specialists Malwarebytes unter 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once, partially several victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies had already been the target of a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom required by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the reports of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators specialize in attacks on corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential to obtain ransom is significantly higher than for private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes of chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the malware have been designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks was terrifying quickly over the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active on the computer of a victim, it searches for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the receivables of blackmail presses.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final breakdown code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrency Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, where private users find the personal photo database at stake, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage occurs when a Ransomware strikes.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses through Ransomware, 13 percent even had to cancel their business operations completely, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always tell the victims: pay not, you only support the problem," "" "explained Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay will receive their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "for managers it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in the face of a standstill in operation." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure examined the user-winning areas and contact with the blackmailers and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators actually try to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims via chat, how they can pay per Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private people are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five digits to return their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potential high and relatively risk-free gains from the ransomware pressing, the hackers become more and more professional and share their work, says Safety expert Chester Wisniewski of the anti-virus provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware circa within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">It is more likely that these are three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware in the form of a software building block to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "the so-called" "" "malware" "" "kits were created by the malware themselves, advice and additional tools for a unique fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">"delivery includes a calibration tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," Wisniewski says.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmail presses are then looking for further hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">You log in one of the forums in the underground, buys the set from a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per infected host.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually the criminals employ spammers with dissemination," "" "Wisniewski explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known for many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of the companies IT leaders in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to repel ransomware by means of file back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful blackmail, the offenders threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," "" "explains Malwarebytes of chief Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Depending on the type of data, the damage potential is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the future, the perpetrators could, in future, take on completely new goals on the Internet of Things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Defcon's conference, safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the activation of such a blocked heat could well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="4">Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the HR-V is only 1.60 m high, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear.</seg>

<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seats of the rear bench can be folded up like a cinema chair and thus offer storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The trunk can be loaded properly, but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The 1.6-liter diesel engine with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">He should do his job a little bit quieter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4,7 l / 100 km is encouraging.</seg>

<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>

<seg id="20">"" "the collision warning sometimes irritates, because when maneuvering, it evaluates many obstacles as" "" "approaching objects." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">The high-beam assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent controller responds to the traffic sign detection and throttles the speed if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="23">But the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, App integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and one HDMI-jack lie under the armrest and are therefore a bit awkward to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who don't want to invest so much will receive the petrol engine from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="2">It stumps regularly on the circumference road - here's a picture of November.</seg>
<seg id="3">But this is to change: the legal dispute is to be extended.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is good news for all drivers who are in traffic on the ambient street every evening in traffic jams, when driving over the motorway, feeder (A 43).</seg>
<seg id="5">The road construction will be extended next Tuesday and Wednesday (16 / 17 August) in the area between the Hammer Street and the exit Weser Straße at 700 meters.</seg>
<seg id="6">Drivers can then go straight from the Hammer Street to the right.</seg>
<seg id="7">The big advantage: the traffic is getting early, which improves the overall sequence on the busy section of the federal road 51.</seg>
<seg id="8">The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district of Münster-West.</seg>
<seg id="9">The road narrowing on the feeder is annoying for drivers between 17 and 19 o'clock.</seg>
<seg id="10">On weekdays, the backlog reaches the bridge over the Albersloe path and sometimes beyond.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is why the needle hole on the B 51 is just before the exit Weser Straße.</seg>

<seg id="13">The second track had to be built back a good three-fourths years ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">The reason for this was that static calculations had shown that the bridge could no longer have the necessary load capacity, in order to absorb the heavy-duty traffic two-lane.</seg>
<seg id="15">How long this bottleneck and the connected daily traffic will continue, the competent national company cannot say.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, it has to be reckoned with years, because the bridge has an official rest-life up to 2034.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips for sleeping disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning it is not possible to think of sleep far before the alarm bells.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleeping disorders express?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many causes behind them, says Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society for Sleep and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">But the insomnia is what you see for the time being, so an inlet and sleep disturbance.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is precisely the sleeping experience that many people feel unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the Executive Board of the German GP Association, with practice in Varel in Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also drugs.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not infrequently is the sleeping disorder an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is common in the case of depression," "" "says Acute." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it may be that different factors threaten each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, those who have a herniated disc can sleep well, wake up every two to three hours and may start thinking about everyday problems and worries.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should sleep disturb the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well for a period of one month in at least three nights per week should go to the doctor, throw away.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: you are worn down, tired, sleepy, has difficulty with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or bodily complaints such as stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to alleviate sleep disturbance, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or even drugs - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, low-level medical practitioners hardly exist, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medicine centre at the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">For this reason, in case of trouble sleeping, one should first contact the family doctor, says the shooting range.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified with studies whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep and what will happen?</seg>
<seg id="26">For example, in case of snoring with respiratory problems, in case of sick daytime, sleepwalkers, or if you do not find the cause of a sleep disturbance, Fifa explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is not necessary to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "please do not make a nap," "" "says Fifa." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After the cladding you go to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-goggles, a chest strap and a feeler on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera on the ceiling shows the sleeping end.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can those affected get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws for better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">You can't sleep long in bed, do not sleep long in bed, do not watch TV for falling asleep, avoid alcohol and do not watch the clock at night - then you start counting immediately, and that is quite and not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="2">Professional thieves at Düsseldorf Airport</seg>
<seg id="3">The police of the Düsseldorf police were arrested on Thursday by two women and two men aged 50 to 61.</seg>
<seg id="4">As a band the suspect had committed several bags of handkerchief and luggage.</seg>
<seg id="5">At 21.30 p.m. civil servants in the area of the airport of Dusseldorf again recognized a gang known to the policemen from past theft events.</seg>
<seg id="6">The two women and two men had committed several offences since mid-July and were in a collective, workable and especially professional manner.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Specialists of the Crime Commissariat 34 can prove four acts to the thieves, who had travelled to Germany specifically for the offence of criminal offences.</seg>
<seg id="8">They had spent a total of more than 15.000 Euro.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few lime trees, in between still some cobblestones: the Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain looks not like at first sight, but the police counts them to the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you walk along the road from east to west, one passes by playgrounds, a refreshed kindergarten and a Bioladen.</seg>
<seg id="3">Someone "ugly!" sprayed on the facade of a grey house.</seg>
<seg id="4">In contrast to a Lidl that will soon be demolished, it is already being built: by 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "articles about this" "" "trendy district" "", "as the competent real estate firm Friedrichshain calls, are, however, prefers to be billed with burning cars over the last few weeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rent contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin-based inner senator Henkel has spoken several times for a hard action of the police against the project, the area called" "" "no-go-zone" "" "for policemen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">After having cleared the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, on 22 June, the police patrol official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, locked out parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the meantime, construction workers were working on behalf of the unknown homeowners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers marched under the jubilation of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the street acts peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the pavement in front of houses in the sun, others are talking prem späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the building projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left-hand violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who has three children here, are mainly irritated by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez, who wished for a majority of police protection from the vandalizing left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin interior senator and the police do between house occupants and their neighbors, apparently does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain, in East Berlin, was actually a traditional working-class district, which today, compared to the rest of the city, has a low average income and a high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied, among them nearly the entire Mainzer Straße in the vicinity of the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was evacuated under large police regulations in a veritable street battle, many of the projects in the Rigaer were legalized and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, in recent years, the city district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and selections from all over the world: with them residents from East Germany and former occupants now share their Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are being attacked as symbols for this development: they recognize them on raised panes or freshly painted facades, which were thrown with paint bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other road was mentioned this year as often coincided with the words" "" "left-autonomous violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason why not all neighbours look at this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as personal injury, according to statistics, are almost exclusively directed against police officers.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the crimes perpetuate property damage, which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">There is no talk of insecurity for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rented house beside the controversial 94 in a rented house for 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="27">When it comes to violence, it is more important: people in the 94 are their neighbours who are certainly not.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars are no longer there in the Rigaer anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "here you help one another, live together on the street and get more of each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is consciously pulled into the streets of Riga - and has remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is why it was so important that the residents get their way back: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly demand interpretation sovereignty over the borough.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the street will continue to be taken away from them: faceless newbuildings in former buildings displacing the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are actually condominiums that are not interesting for many people here - people who are not so good are living here," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I can absolutely not approve of violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what to do if you never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding of drawn-out who annoy themselves about color bombs: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who draw near should be aware of it - just like someone who pulls into a pub area, can complain badly about noise.</seg>

<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organiser.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It sees itself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working groups for refugees, administration, authorities and anyone else involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine client of the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deuschle is there, the eiving Wollmilksau, which has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">This meant a few - less ridiculous than on the multitude of tasks required - meant when the administration wanted to leave the site.</seg>
<seg id="9">We were looking for an administrative field with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, namely an egg-reliant wool melange.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, Annika Deuschle writes.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organization, work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position limited to three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine customer that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are great and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers will soon be placed in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The local authorities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs of the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility varies from the district office to the municipality and the job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it does not work, if one depends on private dwellings, according to Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">That is why communities need to be humiliated, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So, new containers will soon be placed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine client and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent residence, there are internships, apprenticeships, school grounds, one-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be slaughtered or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "more places would be good," "" "reports Regine customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help master craftsmen, do not-for-profit work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external impact.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no occupational therapy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So it needs offers like sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here also jump management and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They need to explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can make sense of time, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever develops the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach, can't work and be useless, he will never integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">But there are problems also, says customer honestly, "people with whom nothing works." the work of Deuschle and client is therefore always motivating others to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two after the recent events fear radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine customer clearly," "" "what some may call naïve." "" "a residual risk could and would not be excluded." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "these incidents also concern the refugees." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the attackers would complete them completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "says Regine customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main and honorary officials have to look out for activities in the region and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always in the background that soon a new impetus could come to refugees and migrants to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a frontier?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, politics shirks.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to put them on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "we have not arrived in Urbach where we want to go," "" "says Annika Deuschle." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine's customer also makes it clear that the Urs are already at full capacity to integrate the existing people in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in need, let them help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
